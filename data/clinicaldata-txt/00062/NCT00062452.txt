TITLE:
Esophageal Motility and Airway Defenses Among Infants

CONDITION:
Infant, Premature, Diseases

INTERVENTION:
This is not an interventional study.

SUMMARY:

      Feeding difficulties and airway related consequences contribute significantly to the infant
      mortality and morbidity. Some of these problems may be dependent on neural control and
      muscular function. Prematurity, congenital anomalies and perinatal depression represent
      three important conditions in infants, that may have feeding and airway
      difficulties.Development of motility of the foregut and the adaptation during normal and
      disease in developing infants is unclear.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      With the aid of small clinical research funding from the NIDDK, in this proposal, we have
      developed methods to safely evaluate foregut motility in relation to breathing among high
      risk infants. We are using simultaneous esophageal motility studies, swallowing and
      respiratory measurements in this evaluation.
