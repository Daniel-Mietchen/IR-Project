TITLE:
Assessing Women's Attitudes About the Risk of Infertility Related to Adjuvant Therapy for Early Breast Cancer

CONDITION:
Breast Cancer

INTERVENTION:
psychosocial assessment and care

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Adjuvant therapy given after surgery for early breast cancer may cause
      infertility. Assessing young women's attitudes and feelings about the risk of infertility
      may help improve the ability to plan effective treatment.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying young women's attitudes and feelings about the risk
      of infertility related to adjuvant therapy for stage I or stage II breast cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the attitude toward the risk of infertility related to adjuvant therapy in
           women with early breast cancer.

        -  Correlate, if possible, the patient's attitude with the fact that the patient already
           has children or the time interval between the date of breast cancer diagnosis and the
           date of study participation.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients complete a questionnaire administered by a nontreating physician.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 385 patients will be accrued for this study.
