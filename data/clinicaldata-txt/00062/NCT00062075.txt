TITLE:
Romidepsin in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia

CONDITION:
Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia With 11q23 (MLL) Abnormalities

INTERVENTION:
romidepsin

SUMMARY:

      This phase II trial is studying how well romidepsin works in treating patients with relapsed
      or refractory acute myeloid leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as romidepsin, work
      in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the complete and partial response rate in patients with relapsed or refractory
      acute myeloid leukemia treated with FR901228 (depsipeptide).

      II. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. III. Correlate clinical response
      with specific cytogenetic abnormalities in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to the presence of a specific chromosomal
      abnormality (t[8;21] vs inv 16 vs t[15;17] vs absence of these chromosomal abnormalities).

      Patients receive romidepsin IV over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and 15.

      Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
