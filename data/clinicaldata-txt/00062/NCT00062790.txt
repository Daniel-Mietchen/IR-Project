TITLE:
Effect Of Dutasteride On Intraprostatic Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) Levels

CONDITION:
Prostatic Hyperplasia

INTERVENTION:
Dutasteride

SUMMARY:

      This study is being done to determine how much certain hormone levels in the prostate
      decrease when a patient takes dutasteride 0.5mg daily for 3 months prior to TURP. Male
      patients at least 50 years old willing to take either dutasteride or a placebo (dummy pill)
      once daily by mouth for 3 months prior to having a surgery to reduce the size of their
      prostate. During the surgery, very small pieces of the prostate that are removed will be
      tested to see how much dihydrotestosterone and testosterone (male hormones) are in the
      tissue.
