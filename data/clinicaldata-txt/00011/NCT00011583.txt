TITLE:
Robot Assisted Upper Limb Neuro-Rehabilitation

CONDITION:
Acute Stroke

INTERVENTION:
Robot-assisted therapy

SUMMARY:

      Our long term objectives are to understand the mechanisms of motor impairment following
      neurologic injury and to develop interventions to improve motor recovery. A series of
      complementary, overlapping clinical trials and development activities will validate and
      optimize the use of robot-assisted upper limb therapy for neuro rehabilitation.

      We have developed a robotic system that assists or resists elbow and shoulder movements in
      three dimensional space. In addition to unilateral exercise modes, a novel bimanual mode
      enables hemiparetic subjects to practice mirror image upper limb exercises.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Randomized controlled clinical trial of the Mirror Image Movement Enabler (MIME) robotic
      device for shoulder and elbow neurorehabilitation in subacute stroke patients. MIME
      incorporates a PUMA 560 robot that applies forces to the paretic limb during unilateral and
      bilateral movements in three dimensions. Robot-assisted treatment (bilateral, unilateral,
      and combined bilateral and unilateral) was compared with conventional therapy.
