Weight loss motivations

SUMMARY:

      This study tests the effects of emphasizing different motivations for wanting to lose weight
      on weight loss maintenance in women. At the start of the study, participants will be weighed
      and will complete questionnaires about their health, weight history, eating and exercise
      habits, body satisfaction and mood. Participants will then be randomly assigned to 1 of 4
      treatments. Participants in all 4 groups will receive information on topics related to
      eating and exercise, and will receive calorie and fat intake goals, and exercise goals. The
      4 treatments will differ in the emphasis given to various reasons for wanting to lose
      weight. At 6, 12 and 18 months after enrollment, participants will again have weights
      measured and fill out questionnaires.
