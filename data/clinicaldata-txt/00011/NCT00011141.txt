TITLE:
Lactobacillus Plantarum as Therapy for NK-T Cell Deficiency

CONDITION:
Diabetes Mellitus

INTERVENTION:
Oral lactobacillus administration

SUMMARY:

      The etiology of immune-mediated diabetes mellitus (IMD) remains unclear. However, previous
      studies indicate that autoimmunity may be a result of dysfunction of natural killer T cells
      (NK-T cells). Newly diagnoses patients with IMD have been shown in our laboratory to have
      significantly lower NK-T cells than normal controls. Other studies have shown that oral
      administration of lactobacillus can boost NK-T cell activity in children with HIV without
      side effects. Our objective is to evaluate the effect of lactobacillus administration on
      NK-T cell activity in patients with IMD
