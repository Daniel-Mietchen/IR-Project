TITLE:
Phase II Study of SCH66336, A Farnesyltransferase Inhibitor in Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML)

CONDITION:
Myelogenous Leukemia, Chronic

INTERVENTION:
SCH66336

SUMMARY:

      The goal of this research is to see if giving the drug SCH66336 by mouth can improve the
      disease in patients with chronic or accelerated phase CML. The safety of this treatment will
      also be studied.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Objectives for this study are two-fold:

        1. To determine the efficacy of SCH66336 in patients with chronic phase and accelerated
           phase CML in relation to response rate, duration of response, and survival.

        2. To assess the toxicity of SCH66366 in these patients.
