TITLE:
SPRINT - Randomized Trial of Tibial Fracture Fixation

CONDITION:
Tibial Fracture

INTERVENTION:
Intramedullary nail implant

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a difference in the rate of healing of
      a tibia fracture treated with an intramedullary nail based on whether or not the bone was
      reamed prior to nail insertion.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Patients with tibia fractures that are amenable to being treated with both a reamed and an
      unreamed nail will be randomized via telephone to one of the two groups. These patients then
      will be followed for a year with clinical, as well as subjective, outcome follow-up
      questionnaires. Time to healing, as well as repeat interventions and adverse events, will be
      tracked. The rationale for doing a large sample size multi-center trial is the hope that a
      clear answer to whether or not one of these two methods is significantly better than the
      other will become apparent and thus aid surgeons in making a more informed operative
      treatment choice.
