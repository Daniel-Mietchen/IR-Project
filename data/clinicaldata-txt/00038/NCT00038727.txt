TITLE:
Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study

CONDITION:
Diabetes Mellitus

INTERVENTION:
Group Lifestyle

SUMMARY:

      The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) was a multi-center trial examining the ability of an
      intensive lifestyle or metformin to prevent or delay the development of diabetes in a high
      risk population due to the presence of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). The DPP has ended
      early demonstrating that lifestyle reduced diabetes onset by 58% and metformin reduced
      diabetes onset by 31%.

      The DPPOS is designed to take advantage of the scientifically and clinically valuable DPP
      participants. This group of participants is nearly 50% minority and represents the largest
      IFG/IGT population ever studied. Clinically important research questions remain that focus
      on 1) durability of the prior DPP intervention, 2) determination of the clinical course of
      precisely known new onset diabetes, in particular regarding microvascular disease, CVD risk
      factors and atherosclerosis, 3) close examination of these topics in men vs women and in
      minority populations.
