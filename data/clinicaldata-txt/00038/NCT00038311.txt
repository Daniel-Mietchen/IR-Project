TITLE:
Safety and Efficacy of (PN-152,243)/PN-196,444 in the Prevention of Thrombocytopenia

CONDITION:
Sarcoma

INTERVENTION:
PN-152,243)/PN-196,444

SUMMARY:

      Intensive chemotherapy is associated with significant thrombocytopenia, often requiring
      platelet transfusion to maintain platelet counts. This investigational drug has demonstrated
      the ability to increase platelet counts. This study will test the safety and efficacy of an
      investigational drug in the prevention of thrombocytopenia in patients with high-risk
      sarcoma receiving AI (Adriamycin/Ifosfamide) chemotherapy.
