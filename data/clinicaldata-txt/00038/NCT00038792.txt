TITLE:
Phase I/II Trial rHuKFG for the Treatment of Steroid Refractory Gastrointestinal Acute GVHD

CONDITION:
Acute Graft Versus Host Disease

INTERVENTION:
Recombinant Human Keratinocyte Growth Factor

SUMMARY:

      Phase II efficacy evaluation, phase I/II efficacy and toxicity trial of recombinant human
      keratinocyte growth factor for the treatment of steroid refractory gastrointestinal graft
      versus host disease.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      There are two processes that cause diarrhea as the clinical manifestation of graft versus
      host disease. The first is the obvious immunologic attack on the colonic epithelium of the
      recipient. Once this immunologic attack has been abated the recipient is left with a colonic
      mucosa that is devoid of microvilli and has a smooth intestinal boarder. This is frequently
      subject to superinfections from bacteria all of which cause the diarrhea to continue.
      Researchers only endpoint to measure clinical response of immunosuppression is the
      resolution of diarrhea. The human recombinant keratinocyte growth factor stimulates the
      growth of colonic epithelium. The growth of colonic epithelium will in turn probably
      ameliorate some of the diarrhea associated with graft versus host disease.
