TITLE:
Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Unresectable or Metastatic Biliary Tract or Gallbladder Cancer

CONDITION:
Extrahepatic Bile Duct Cancer

INTERVENTION:
fluorouracil

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating
      patients who have unresectable or metastatic biliary tract or gallbladder cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the 6-month survival and overall survival of patients with
      unresectable or metastatic biliary tract carcinoma or gallbladder cancer treated with
      gemcitabine, fluorouracil, and leucovorin calcium. II. Determine the tumor response in these
      patients treated with this regimen. III. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes followed by leucovorin calcium IV
      and fluorouracil IV over 5-10 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks
      for a minimum of 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 4 years.
