TITLE:
Trial of ABI-007 in Previously Treated Patients With Metastatic Melanoma

CONDITION:
Melanoma

INTERVENTION:
ABI-007

SUMMARY:

      This trial will treat patients previously treated for advanced (metastatic) melanoma (skin
      cancer) with a new chemotherapeutic medicine. The new chemotherapy will be administered
      weekly in cycles of three weekly doses followed by one week rest. A minimum of three cycles
      of therapy will be given to determine the anti-tumor response of the new chemotherapy.
      Patients may continue to stay on therapy a maximum of 9-12 cycles if treatment shows
      continuing benefit.
