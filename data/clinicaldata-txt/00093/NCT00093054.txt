TITLE:
Cranberry Juice for Treatment of Urinary Tract Infections

CONDITION:
Urinary Tract Infections

INTERVENTION:
Cranberry juice

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether daily consumption of cranberry juice
      lessens the symptoms and prevents the recurrence of urinary tract infections (UTIs). This
      study will also determine whether drinking cranberry juice for 6 months selects for less
      virulent bacteria in the rectal, vaginal, and urethral areas.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to consume either 8 ounces of cranberry
      juice or placebo juice twice a day for 6 months. Participants will have follow-up visits at
      3 and 6 months, and whenever they experience a symptomatic episode. Urine, vaginal and
      rectal specimens will be taken at each visit to test for the presence of bacteria that cause
      urinary tract infections. Participants will complete a questionnaire at study entry, Day 3,
      Weeks 1 and 2, and monthly thereafter or whenever there is a recurrence of symptoms.
