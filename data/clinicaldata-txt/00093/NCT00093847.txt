TITLE:
Optimizing the Effectiveness of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) in Treatment-Resistant Depression

CONDITION:
Depression

INTERVENTION:
S-adenosyl methione (SAMe)

SUMMARY:

      This study will determine the effectiveness of adding S-adenosyl methionine to
      antidepressant drug treatment in reducing depressive symptoms in depressed people who have
      not responded to antidepressants alone.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Some people with depression do not respond well to antidepressant treatment. S-adenosyl
      methionine (SAMe) is a naturally occurring compound that may have antidepressant effects.
      SAMe may also enhance the effectiveness of other antidepressants, such as selective
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). This study will determine the effectiveness of oral
      SAMe in enhancing the effects of SSRIs in patients currently not responding to SSRI
      treatment.

      This study will last 6 weeks. No follow-up visits will occur. Participants will be randomly
      assigned to add either oral SAMe or placebo to their existing SSRI regimen for 6 weeks.
      Depression scales and self-report questionnaires regarding depressive symptoms will be used
      to assess participants at the end of the study.
