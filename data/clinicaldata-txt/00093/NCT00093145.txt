TITLE:
Study of Albumin-bound Paclitaxel (Abraxane) in Combination With Carboplatin and Herceptin in Patients With Advanced Breast Cancer

CONDITION:
Breast Cancer

INTERVENTION:
Albumin-bound paclitaxel

SUMMARY:

      This trial will treat patients with advanced breast cancer with a new anti-cancer medicine
      used in combination with two existing anti-cancer medications: Albumin-bound paclitaxel
      (ABI-007), Carboplatin and Herceptin. Participants will be given the combination therapy on
      a weekly basis and may continue on therapy as long as their condition improves and drug
