TITLE:
Arsenic Trioxide, Cytarabine, and Idarubicin in Treating Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia

CONDITION:
Leukemia

INTERVENTION:
filgrastim

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as arsenic trioxide, cytarabine, and idarubicin,
      work in different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.
      Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of arsenic trioxide
      when given together with cytarabine and idarubicin in treating patients with acute myeloid
      leukemia.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and/or biologically effective dose of arsenic
           trioxide followed by high-dose cytarabine and idarubicin in patients with previously
           untreated de novo or secondary acute myeloid leukemia.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of arsenic trioxide. Patients are stratified
      according to timing of accrual (before November 2002 vs since November 2002).

      Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1 hour on day 1 followed by high-dose cytarabine
      IV over 1 hour every 12 hours on days 1-6 and idarubicin IV over 30 minutes on days 2-4
      (immediately after doses 3, 5 and 7 of cytarabine). Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF)
      subcutaneously beginning 12 hours after the last dose of chemotherapy and continuing until
      blood counts recover.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of arsenic trioxide until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD), current dose used for myelodysplastic syndromes or acute promyelocytic
      leukemia, or biologically effective dose is reached. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. The biologically
      effective dose is defined as the dose at which 3 patients with constitutive STAT3 activity
      have the activity negated after the first dose of arsenic trioxide.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 40 patients (6 for stratum I [accrued before November 2002]
      and 34 for stratum II [accrued since November 2002] will be accrued for this study within 3
      years.
