TITLE:
Study of Clevidipine Assessing Its Postoperative Antihypertensive Effect in Cardiac Surgery (ESCAPE-2)

CONDITION:
Hypertension

INTERVENTION:
clevidipine

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to establish the efficacy of of clevidipine versus placebo in
      treating postoperative hypertension. Approximately 100 patients with postoperative
      hypertension undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), off-pump coronary artery
      bypass (OPCAB) or minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) surgery and/or
      valve replacement/repair procedures were anticipated to be randomly assigned to one of two
      treatment groups: clevidipine or placebo.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      The primary objective was to determine the efficacy of clevidipine versus placebo in
      treating postoperative hypertension by comparing the incidence of bailout in the clevidipine
      and placebo treatment groups during the 30-minute time period from initiation of study drug.
      Secondary objectives included assessments of efficacy through measuring time to target blood
      pressure (BP) lowering effect defined as 15% reduction in SBP, change in mean arterial
      pressure (MAP) and the incidence of bailout by causality. Assessments for safety included
      change in heart rate (HR) from baseline.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 18 Years to N/A
Criteria:

        Pre-randomization Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provide written informed consent before initiation of any study-related procedures.

          -  Be at least 18 years of age

          -  Be scheduled for cardiac surgery (including Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting [CABG],
             Off Pump Coronary Artery Bypass [OPCAB], Minimally Invasive Direct Coronary Artery
             Bypass [MIDCAB] surgery, and/or valve replacement/repair procedures)

        Pre-randomization Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women of child-bearing potential (unless they have a negative pregnancy test)

          -  Recent cerebrovascular accident (within 3 months before randomization)

          -  Known intolerance to calcium channel blockers

          -  Allergy to soybean oil or egg lecithin (components of the lipid vehicle)

          -  Pre-existing left bundle branch block or permanent ventricular pacing

          -  Any other disease or condition, which, in the judgment of the investigator would
             place a patient at undue risk by being enrolled in the trial.

          -  Participation in another therapeutic drug or therapeutic device trial within 30 days
             of starting study

        Post-randomization Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Expected to survive beyond 24 hours post-surgical procedure

          -  No surgical complications or conditions, present or anticipated, that preclude them
             from inclusion in a double blind, placebo-controlled study

          -  Determined to be hypertensive (SBP > 140 mm Hg) within 4 hours of arrival in a
             postoperative setting

          -  It is the investigator's intent to lower the patient's SBP by a minimum of 15% from
             its baseline value
