TITLE:
Clevidipine in the Postoperative Treatment of Hypertension (ECLIPSE-NIC)

CONDITION:
Hypertension

INTERVENTION:
clevidipine

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to establish the safety of clevidipine in the treatment of
      postoperative hypertension. Approximately 250-500 patients with postoperative hypertension
      after undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), off-pump coronary artery bypass
      (OPCAB) or minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) surgery and/or valve
      replacement/repair procedures were anticipated to be randomly assigned to one of two
      treatment groups: clevidipine or nicardipine.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      The primary objective was to establish the safety of clevidipine in the treatment of
      postoperative hypertension, as assessed by comparing the incidences of death, stroke, MI and
      renal dysfunction in the clevidipine and nicardipine treatment groups from the initiation of
      study drug infusion through postoperative Day 30. Secondary objectives were to evaluate the
      efficacy of study drug, assessed by the blood pressure (BP) lowering effect, and additional
      safety variables.

Criteria:

        Prerandomization Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provide written informed consent before initiation of any study related procedures.

          -  Be at least 18 years of age

          -  Be scheduled for Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG), Off Pump Coronary Artery
             Bypass (OPCAB), Minimally Invasive Direct Coronary Artery Bypass (MIDCAB) surgery,
             and/or valve replacement/repair surgery

        Prerandomization Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women of child-bearing potential (unless they have a negative pregnancy test)

          -  Recent cerebrovascular accident (within 3 months before randomization)

          -  Known intolerance to calcium channel blockers

          -  Known or suspected hypersensitivity to nicardipine

          -  Allergy to soybean oil or egg lecithin (components of the lipid vehicle)

          -  Pre-existing permanent ventricular pacing

          -  Any other disease or condition, which, in the judgment of the investigator would
             place a patient at undue risk by being enrolled in the trial

          -  Participation in another therapeutic drug or therapeutic device trial within 30 days
             of starting study

        Postrandomization Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Expected to survive beyond 24 hours post-surgical procedure

          -  No surgical complications or conditions, present or anticipated, that preclude them
             from inclusion in the study

          -  Determined to be hypertensive postoperatively as determined by the investigator
