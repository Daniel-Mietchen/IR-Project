TITLE:
Clevidipine in the Perioperative Treatment of Hypertension (ECLIPSE-NTG)

CONDITION:
Hypertension

INTERVENTION:
clevidipine

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to establish the safety of clevidipine in the treatment of
      perioperative hypertension. Approximately 500-900 patients with perioperative hypertension
      undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB)
      or minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) surgery and/or valve
      replacement/repair procedures were anticipated to be randomly assigned to one of two
      treatment groups: clevidipine or nitroglycerin.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      The primary objective was to establish the safety of clevidipine in the treatment of
      perioperative hypertension, as assessed by comparing the incidences of death, stroke, MI and
      renal dysfunction in the clevidipine and nitroglycerin treatment groups from the initiation
      of study drug infusion through postoperative Day 30. Secondary objectives were to evaluate
      the efficacy of study drug, assessed by the blood pressure (BP) lowering effect, and
      additional safety variables.

Criteria:

        Prerandomization Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provide written informed consent before initiation of any study related procedures.

          -  Be at least 18 years of age

          -  Be scheduled for Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG), Off Pump Coronary Artery
             Bypass (OPCAB), Minimally Invasive Direct Coronary Artery Bypass (MIDCAB) surgery,
             and/or valve replacement/repair surgery

        Prerandomization Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women of child-bearing potential (unless they have a negative pregnancy test)

          -  Recent cerebrovascular accident (within 3 months before randomization)

          -  Known intolerance to calcium channel blockers

          -  Known or suspected hypersensitivity to nitroglycerin

          -  Allergy to soybean oil or egg lecithin (components of the lipid vehicle)

          -  Pre-existing permanent ventricular pacing

          -  Any other disease or condition, which, in the judgment of the investigator would
             place a patient at undue risk by being enrolled in the trial

          -  Participation in another therapeutic drug or therapeutic device trial within 30 days
             of starting study

        Postrandomization Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Determined to be hypertensive perioperatively as determined by the investigator
