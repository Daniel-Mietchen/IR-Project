TITLE:
Safety of KAI-9803 for Injection With Angioplasty Following Heart Attack

CONDITION:
Myocardial Infarction

INTERVENTION:
KAI-9803 for Injection

SUMMARY:

      Restoring blood flow to coronary arteries as quickly as possible is the best way to reduce
      the damage to the muscle that occurs with a heart attack. However, up to 25-50% of patients
      who have angioplasty may have ongoing damage to the heart muscle when the blockage is opened
      and blood flow is restored. Complications which may result from this ongoing damage include
      a larger area of damaged muscle in the heart, enlargement of the heart, an increased risk of
      death, and an increased risk of heart failure. Some of the ongoing damage may involve
      increased levels of the protein kinase C (PKC) enzyme. KAI-9803 is a selective inhibitor of
      delta PKC. In this study, delta PKC is used with angioplasty and other standard procedures
      to restore blood flow after a heart attack. This study is designed to evaluate safety of
      different amounts of KAI-9803 when used in treating heart attack patients undergoing
      angioplasty. We will also try to evaluate whether KAI-9803 can reduce the amount of heart
      muscle damage and the complications that may occur in these patients.

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 18 Years to N/A
Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Symptoms of cardiac ischemia at rest or with increasing frequency (angina or angina
             equivalent), with episodes lasting for at least 30 minutes within 6 hours of
             presentation

          -  Persistent ST-segment elevation of  0.2 mV in at least 2 contiguous precordial leads
             indicative of anterior Myocardial Infarction (MI) location (leads V1-V4)

          -  At least 18 years old

          -  Complete occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (Thrombolysis in Myocardial
             Infarction (TIMI) 0-1 flow) demonstrated on the initial angiogram

          -  Culprit lesion suitable for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any left bundle branch block (new or old), intraventricular conduction defect, or
             paced rhythm that would obscure the diagnosis of acute anterior ST Elevation
             Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)

          -  Any prior documented myocardial infarction (MI), including old Q waves documented on
             prior ECGs or a clinical history of definite MI

          -  Any prior coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)

          -  Cardiogenic shock at initial hospital presentation, consisting of persistent
             hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg for > 20 minutes) and signs of
             end-organ dysfunction (oliguria, altered mental status, poor peripheral perfusion,
             and lactic acidosis)

          -  TIMI grade 2 or 3 flow in the left anterior descending artery documented on the
             initial diagnostic angiogram

          -  Culprit lesion in the left anterior descending artery that is not suitable for
             primary PCI

          -  Treatment with intravenous fibrinolytic therapy (i.e. alteplase, reteplase,
             tenecteplase, or streptokinase) within the 24 hours before presentation

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Know baseline creatinine > 2.5 mg/dL without renal dialysis/renal replacement therapy
             within the 30 days before presentation

          -  Inability to comply with study procedures, inability to undergo cardiac
             catheterization or primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)

          -  Participation in a study of experimental therapy (drug or device) within 30 days of
             presentation, or prior participation in this study
