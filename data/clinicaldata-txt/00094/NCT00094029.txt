TITLE:
A Treatment Protocol for Patients With Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST) Who May Derive Benefit From Treatment With SU011248

CONDITION:
Gastrointestinal Neoplasm

INTERVENTION:
Sutent

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to permit access to SU011248 for treatment use by patients with
      GIST given the following conditions: a) patients undergo screening, but are not eligible for
      participation in ongoing clinical studies such as A6181004; AND b) patients have GIST which
      standard treatments have not been able to control with acceptable toxicity AND c) patients
      have the potential to derive clinical benefit from treatment with SU011248.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Given that an Expanded Access study does not meet the definition of a controlled clinical
      investigation, and as such, is not considered an applicable drug clinical trial per NIH,
      Basic Results for such studies are not required to be reported. Protocol A6181036 has been
      identified as an Expanded Access trial, and has been registered to ClinicalTrials.gov,
      however Basic Results will not be posted.
