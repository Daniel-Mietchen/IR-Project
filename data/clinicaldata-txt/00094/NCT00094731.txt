TITLE:
SeniorWISE: Improving Everyday Memory in At-Risk Elderly

CONDITION:
Aging

INTERVENTION:
Memory Training

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether classes on memory training will help older
      adults to improve or maintain their daily activities.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Volunteer participants will be randomly assigned to experimental (memory training) and
      comparison (health promotion) groups. Both groups will learn strategies for successful
      aging. Participants will be in the study for 27 months and will be interviewed on five
      occasions for 3 hours per interview. The classroom-based intervention is an 8-session, 1 1/2
      hour course designed to teach older adults the use of strategies to improve everyday memory.
      Strategically-placed booster sessions will be provided to subjects within 3 months following
      the last class session.
