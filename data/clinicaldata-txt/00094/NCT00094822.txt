TITLE:
Pegfilgrastim Given Same Day As or Day After Carboplatin and Docetaxel in Advanced Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)

CONDITION:
Lung Cancer

INTERVENTION:
PI Discretion

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Neulasta
      (pegfilgrastim) in reducing infection when given on the same day versus one day after the
      completion of chemotherapy (docetaxel and carboplatin) in patients with advanced or
      metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study is considered to be
      "investigational" because previous studies with Neulasta used next day dosing and not same
      day dosing.
