TITLE:
Evaluation of Modified Treatment Regimens for Treatment of Heavy Menstrual Bleeding Using the HerOption System

CONDITION:
Menorrhagia

INTERVENTION:
Extended treatment regimen using Her Option Cryotherapy

SUMMARY:

      The Her Option Cryoablation Therapy System is a closed-loop cryosurgical device that is
      used to ablate the endometrial lining in pre-menopausal women with menorrhagia (excessive
      menstrual bleeding) due to benign causes. This is a non-incisional procedure, which can be
      performed in a physicians office with minimal sedation.

      Initial FDA clinical studies were conducted with a two-freeze treatment pattern consisting
      of a 4 minute freeze with the Cryoprobe positioned in one cornu followed by a second freeze
      of 6 minutes with the Cryoprobe repositioned in the contralateral cornu.

      Since completion of the early studies, many physicians have experimented with varying freeze
      patterns using longer freeze durations and/or additional freezes at the fundus and the lower
      uterine segment. The results, as reported in the literature, indicate that these extended
      freeze patterns produce significantly better results than the original regimen.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      American Medical Systems, Inc. (AMS) hypothesized that the original treatment pattern used
      to support a previous FDA approval for the Her Option Cryoablation Therapy System for
      Treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding was not optimal and that extended freeze regimens
      will result in improved outcomes for patients.
