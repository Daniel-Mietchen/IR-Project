TITLE:
Anti-Angiogenesis Agent AG-013736 In Patients With Metastatic Melanoma

CONDITION:
Melanoma

INTERVENTION:
Axitinib [AG-013736]

SUMMARY:

      This is a Phase 2 study being conducted at multiple centers in the United States and France.
      Patients having melanoma that has spread to other parts of the body (i.e., metastatic) are
      eligible to participate. Patients must have disease that has been treated with no more than
      1 prior treatment for metastatic disease (prior adjuvant treatment for localized disease
      does not count as prior treatment for metastatic disease). The purpose of the study is to
      test whether the angiogenesis inhibitor AG-013736 is an effective treatment for metastatic
      melanoma as shown by the number of patients in the study who experience significant and
      durable tumor shrinkage.
