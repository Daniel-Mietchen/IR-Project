Abacavir/Lamivudine

SUMMARY:

      This study was designed to evaluate if subjects who took 600 mg of abacavir and 300 mg of

      to subjects who took 300 mg of abacavir and 150 mg of lamivudine administered as separate
      tablets twice-daily.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      A phase IIIB randomized, open-label, multicenter, parallel-arm study to evaluate the
      short-term safety and tolerability of the abacavir/lamivudine fixed-dose combination tablet
      administered once-daily or the separate abacavir and lamivudine tablets administered
      twice-daily, as part of a three or four-drug regimen, in antiretroviral naive HIV-1 infected
