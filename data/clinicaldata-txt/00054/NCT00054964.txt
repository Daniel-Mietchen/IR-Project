TITLE:
Comparative Effectiveness of a Breath-operated Albuterol Inhaler in Asthma Patients With Poor Inhaler Technique

CONDITION:
Asthma

INTERVENTION:
Albuterol HFA-BOI

SUMMARY:

      This study was designed to examine the effectiveness of a breath-operated albuterol inhaler
      in asthma patients who have difficulty using their standard "press-and-breathe" inhaler.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      This was a single-center, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, 2-period, 2-sequence,
      single dose-dose, crossover comparison of the ability of Albuterol BOI-HFA to produce
      bronchodilation relative to that produced by to albuterol MDI-HFA in at least 12 asthmatics
      with poor inhaler coordinating ability.
