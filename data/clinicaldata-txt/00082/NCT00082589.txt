        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Current symptoms consistent with mild to moderate heart failure (NYHA functional
             class II and III)

          -  LVEF (left ventricular ejection fraction) of <35% by equilibrium-gated RVG at
             screening

          -  Therapy with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin
             receptor blocker (ARB) and beta-blocker (BB) (unless documented intolerance) for at

             failure (NYHA functional class IV) within 6 months of screening

          -  Use of eplerenone or spironolactone within 30 days of randomization or for more than
             7 days within the previous 6 months
