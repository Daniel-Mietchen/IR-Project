TITLE:
Safety and Efficacy of TP10, a Complement Inhibitor, in Adult Women Undergoing Cardiopulmonary Bypass Surgery

CONDITION:
Myocardial Ischemia

INTERVENTION:
TP10

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to determine if the study drug (TP10), which blocks complement
      release, can reduce such side effects of complement inflammation as chest pain or heart
      attacks and be taken safely in women who undergo cardiopulmonary bypass surgery.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      During cardiac surgery, a substance called complement is released by the body. This
      complement causes inflammation, which can lead to side effects such as chest pain, heart
      attacks, or heart failure. The purpose of this study is to determine if the study drug
      (TP10), which blocks complement release, can reduce such side events and be taken safely in
      women.
