TITLE:
Anastrozole Biphosphonate Study in Postmenopausal Women With Hormone-Receptor-Positive Early Breast Cancer

CONDITION:
Breast Cancer

INTERVENTION:
Anastrozole

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety parameters of anastrozole with regard to its
      potential effects on postmenopausal bone loss and on lipid profiles. This trial is conducted
      to investigate the effects of risedronate on BMD and on bone metabolism in postmenopausal
      women using anastrozole as adjuvant therapy for hormone-receptor-positive early breast
      cancer and who are high or moderate risk of fragility fracture. It is also conducted to
      determine the effects of anastrozole on bone mineral density (BMD) and on bone metabolism in
      women at low risk of fragility fracture.
