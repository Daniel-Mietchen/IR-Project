TITLE:
Epothilone (Ixabepilone) Plus Capecitabine Versus Capecitabine Alone in Patients With Advanced Breast Cancer

CONDITION:
Cancer

INTERVENTION:
Ixabepilone + Capecitabine

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this clinical research study is to learn if BMS-247550 added to the approved
      therapy of capecitabine (Xeloda) provides measurable clinical benefits over capecitabine
      alone in women with metastatic breast cancer. Patients should have previously received an
      anthracycline and a taxane. The safety of this treatment will also be studied.
