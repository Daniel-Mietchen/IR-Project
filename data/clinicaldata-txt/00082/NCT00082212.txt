TITLE:
A Study in Patients With Persistent or Recurrent Epithelial Ovarian or Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma

CONDITION:
Ovarian Cancer

INTERVENTION:
Cetuximab

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to determine the overall response rate, time to progression,
      and 1 yr survival with cetuximab in patients with ovarian or primary peritoneal carcinoma.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      To determine the overall response rate of cetuximab alone in subjects with ovarian or
      primary peritoneal carcinoma who have persistent or recurrent disease following 1-2 previous
      regimens of chemotherapy. Potential relationship between response, dose, and the occurence
      of rash in the treatment of subjects who have stable disease after the initial 6 weeks of
      treatment, time to progression, and 1 yr survival.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: Female
Age: 18 Years to N/A
Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  subjects must have recurrent or persistent epithelial ovarian or primary peritoneal
             carcinoma. Histologic confirmation of the original primary tumor is required.

          -  EGFR expression must be positive as determined by an outside reference lab

          -  Subjects must have had a treatment-free interval following platinum of <12 mos

          -  All subjects must have measurable disease at baseline

          -  Subjects must have at least one recurrent lesion to be used to assess response

          -  Recovery from effect of recent surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with other invasive malignancies (including peritoneal mesotheliomas)

          -  Subjects with unstable cardiac disease or MI within 6 mos

          -  Subjects with Acute hepatitis

          -  Subjects with active or uncontrolled infection

          -  A history of prior cetuximab or other therapy which targets the EGFR pathway or prior
             history of prior chimerized or murine monoclonal antibody therapy
