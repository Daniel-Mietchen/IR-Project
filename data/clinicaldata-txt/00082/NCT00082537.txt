TITLE:
MK0991 Versus Amphotericin B for Empirical Therapy in Febrile, Neutropenic Pediatric Patients (0991-044)

CONDITION:
Neutropenia

INTERVENTION:
caspofungin acetate

SUMMARY:

      This study is a double-blind, randomized study of MK0991 versus liposomal amphotericin B in
      the empirical treatment of pediatric patients (ages 2 through 17 years) who have an absolute
      neutrophil count (ANC) below 500/microliter and who have fever despite broad antibiotic
      coverage. Such patients would be candidates for empirical therapy with an intravenous
      anti-fungal agent.
