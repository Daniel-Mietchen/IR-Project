TITLE:
Tipifarnib and Fulvestrant in Hormone Receptor-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer

CONDITION:
Estrogen Receptor-positive Breast Cancer

INTERVENTION:
fulvestrant

SUMMARY:

      This phase II trial is studying how well giving tipifarnib together with fulvestrant works
      as second-line therapy in treating postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive
      inoperable locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer that has progressed after previous
      first-line endocrine therapy. Tipifarnib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the
      enzymes necessary for their growth. Estrogen can stimulate the growth of breast cancer
      cells. Hormone therapy using fulvestrant may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of
      estrogen. Combining tipifarnib with fulvestrant may kill tumor cells that did not respond to
      first-line therapy.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the efficacy of tipifarnib (R115777, Zarnestra) in combination with
      fulvestrant based on clinical benefit rate (CBR, a combination of complete response rate,
      partial response rate, and stable disease for more than 24 weeks) in postmenopausal women
      with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer who have progressive disease after
      first-line endocrine therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the median time to progression (TTP) and duration of response of tipifarnib
      (R115777, Zarnestra) in combination with fulvestrant in postmenopausal women with hormone
      receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer.

      II. To determine the median overall survival of tipifarnib (R115777, Zarnestra) in
      combination with fulvestrant in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor- positive
      metastatic breast cancer who have progressive disease after first-line endocrine therapy.

      III. To determine the toxicity profile of tipifarnib (R115777, Zarnestra) in combination
      with fulvestrant versus fulvestrant alone (from historical control) in postmenopausal women
      with hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer who have progressive disease after
      first-line endocrine therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive fulvestrant intramuscularly on day 1 and oral tipifarnib twice daily on
      days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity*.

      NOTE: *Fulvestrant continues even if tipifarnib is held for toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the
             breast

             are not eligible; patients who have received one prior dose of fulvestrant within 28
             days are eligible so long as they meet other eligibility criteria

          -  Patients must have ECOG performance status 0-2 (Karnofsky >= 60%)

          -  Patients must have life expectancy of greater than 3 months

          -  Leukocytes >= 3,000/uL

          -  Creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 times the institutional upper limits of normal

          -  Patients must be disease-free of prior invasive malignancies for >= 5 years with the
