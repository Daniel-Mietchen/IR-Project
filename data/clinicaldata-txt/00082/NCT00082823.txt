TITLE:
Intravenous VEGF Trap in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Advanced Solid Tumors or Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma

CONDITION:
Cancer

INTERVENTION:
ziv-aflibercept

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Intravenous VEGF Trap may stop the growth of solid tumors or non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma by stopping blood flow to the cancer.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects of VEGF Trap in treating patients
      with relapsed or refractory advanced solid tumors or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of intravenous VEGF Trap in patients with
           relapsed or refractory advanced solid tumors or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the steady-state pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the ability of this drug to bind circulating vascular endothelial growth
           factor in these patients.

        -  Determine whether antibodies to this drug develop in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the ability of repeated doses of this drug to alter tumor
           growth and vascular permeability in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter, extension study.

      Patients receive VEGF Trap* IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 14 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *Patients receive the same drug dose that they received in MSKCC-03137 (VGFT-ST-0202)

      Patients are followed monthly for 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study within 3-6 months.
