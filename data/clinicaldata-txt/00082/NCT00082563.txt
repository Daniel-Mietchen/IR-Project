SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to determine if Azithromycin in combination with chloroquine is
      superior to chloroquine alone in eradicating P. falciparum asexual parasitemia in
      asymptomatic, semi-immune adults in Western Kenya.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      The trial was terminated prematurely 9 November 2004 due to the inability to recruit the
