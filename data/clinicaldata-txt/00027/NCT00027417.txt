TITLE:
Study of Triostat in Infants During Heart Surgery

CONDITION:
Heart Defects, Congenital

INTERVENTION:
Liothyronine sodium/triiodothyronine

SUMMARY:

      This is a study to determine the safety and efficacy of liothyronine sodium/triiodothyronine
      (Triostat), a synthetic thyroid hormone, when given to infants with congenital heart disease
      during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Patients will be randomized to receive study drug or placebo and randomization will occur
      stratified to each diagnostic category. All patients undergo preoperative echocardiograms to
      provide preoperative cardiac function data. The study drug or placebo will be provided in
      the operating room as an iv bolus just prior to cardiopulmonary bypass and as a bolus
      delivered on release of the aortic cross-clamp. This will be followed by iv for 12 hours.
      Operative data will be collected including CPB time, aortic cross-clamp time, length and
      degree of hypothermia. These data will be extracted from the anesthesia record.
