TITLE:
Study of Albuterol and Oxandrolone in Patients With Facioscapulohumeral Dystrophy (FSHD)

CONDITION:
Muscular Dystrophies

INTERVENTION:
Albuterol

SUMMARY:

      This is a study to determine whether albuterol or oxandrolone, alone or in combination, are
      able to increase strength and muscle mass in patients with FSHD. It also will determine if
      albuterol given in "pulsed" fashion will have more effect than when given continuously.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Patients will be randomized to 1 of 4 groups: placebo, pulsed albuterol, oxandrolone, or
      both pulsed albuterol and oxandrolone. Treatment will continue for 52 weeks unless
      unacceptable side effects occur. Patients will undergo testing of muscle function. All
      patients will return for follow-up assessments at Weeks 4, 12, 26, and 52.
