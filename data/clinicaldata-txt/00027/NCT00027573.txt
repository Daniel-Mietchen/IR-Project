TITLE:
Chemotherapy Followed by Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Unresectable Kidney Cancer

CONDITION:
Kidney Cancer

INTERVENTION:
filgrastim

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Peripheral stem cell transplantation may be able to replace
      immune cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy used to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy followed by donor
      peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have metastatic or
      unresectable kidney cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the overall response rate and overall and disease-free survival of patients
           with unresectable or metastatic renal cell cancer treated with fludarabine and
           cyclophosphamide followed by allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.

        -  Determine the toxicity and treatment-related mortality of this regimen in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the percentage of donor chimerism in patients treated with this regimen.
