TITLE:
Study of Muromonab-CD3 and Cyclosporine in Patients With Giant Cell Myocarditis

CONDITION:
Myocarditis

INTERVENTION:
Muromonab-CD3

SUMMARY:

      This is a study to determine the efficacy of muromonab-CD3 and cyclosporine as treatment in
      patients with giant cell myocarditis (GCM). T lymphocytes appear to be involved in GCM.
      Muromonab-CD3 has been shown to reduce the number of lymphocytes and cyclosporine inhibits
      lymphocyte activation. This treatment may prolong patient survival until transplantation or
      ventricular assist device placement is possible.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Each patient will be randomized to receive either standard care and immunosuppression
      therapy (treatment group) or standard care alone (control group). To prevent bias,
      randomization will be stratified by recency of symptom onset to ensure that both the
      treatment and control groups are balanced with respect to it. Within each of these 2 strata,
      permuted-block randomization will be done to keep the number of treatment and control
      patients balanced. Due to the necessary monitoring of the patients randomized to receive
      immunosuppression therapy, treatment cannot be blinded. Approximately 1 year after the last
      patient has been randomized, the observed times from randomization to the composite endpoint
      (death, transplantation, or LVD placement) will be compared in the treatment and control
      groups.
