TITLE:
Bone Lead Levels and College Achievement Scores

CONDITION:
Lead Poisoning

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      This project studies the relationship between lead exposure and academic achievement in
      college students. Most studies of the neurobehavioral effects of lead have focused on
      performances at the low end of the distribution. There is evidence that lead affects outcome
      across the entire distribution. This is a retrospective cohort study of subjects whose
      cognitive function is adequate to gain admission to college. We will use x-ray fluorescence
      to measure bone lead concentrations in undergraduate college students and test the
      hypothesis that achievement scores are related to early lead exposure. Early lead exposure
      has been shown to have measurable effects on academic performance and neurobehavioral
      outcomes at 18 years of age. Should an effect be found in this study, the spectrum of lead
      toxicity would be expanded to include subjects with above average function.
