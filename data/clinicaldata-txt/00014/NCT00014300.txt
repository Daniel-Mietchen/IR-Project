TITLE:
Glufosfamide in Treating Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme

CONDITION:
Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors

INTERVENTION:
glufosfamide

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of glufosfamide in treating patients who
      have recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the activity of glufosfamide, in terms of objective response rate
      and/or progression-free survival at 6 months, in patients with recurrent glioblastoma
      multiforme. II. Determine the duration of objective response in patients treated with this
      regimen. III. Determine the toxic effects and pharmacokinetic profile of this regimen in
      these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive glufosfamide IV over 60 minutes on
      day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients with stable disease receive treatment for a minimum of 6 months or until
      progression. Patients with an objective complete response receive a maximum of 2 additional
      courses of treatment after confirmation of response. Patients are followed every 6 weeks
      until progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28 patients will be accrued for this study.
