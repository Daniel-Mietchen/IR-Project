TITLE:
Combination Chemotherapy Plus Warfarin in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer

CONDITION:
Prostate Cancer

INTERVENTION:
docetaxel

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.
      Anticoagulant drugs such as warfarin may reduce the risk of blood clots.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus warfarin
      in treating patients who have prostate cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety, efficacy, and durability of docetaxel and estramustine
      followed by doxorubicin and ketoconazole in patients with high-risk, androgen-independent
      prostate cancer. II. Determine whether anticoagulation with warfarin can reduce the
      frequency of thromboembolic complications associated with estramustine in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Regimen A: Patients receive oral estramustine 3 times daily on days 1-5 and
      docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 3 weekly. Patients also receive oral warfarin daily.
      Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for a total of 2 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Regimen B: After completion of regimen A, patients
      receive doxorubicin IV over 30 minutes weekly and oral ketoconazole twice daily. Treatment
      repeats every 4 weeks for a total of 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed monthly until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
