TITLE:
Fludarabine Phosphate and Total-Body Radiation Followed by Donor Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplant and Immunosuppression in Treating Patients With Hematologic Malignancies

CONDITION:
Acute Myeloid Leukemia/Transient Myeloproliferative Disorder

INTERVENTION:
fludarabine phosphate

SUMMARY:

      This clinical trial studies fludarabine phosphate and total-body radiation followed by donor
      peripheral blood stem cell transplant and immunosuppression in treating patients with
      hematologic malignancies. Giving chemotherapy and total-body irradiation before a donor
      peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also
      stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy
      stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow
      make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the
      transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells.
      Giving total-body irradiation together with fludarabine phosphate, cyclosporine, and
      mycophenolate mofetil before transplant may stop this from happening.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the rate of grade III/IV graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in patients treated
      with low-dose total body irradiation (TBI), fludarabine (fludarabine phosphate), PBSC
      infusion and immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil and a disease risk-based
      cyclosporine taper.

      II. To estimate the risk of graft rejection, GVHD, disease response, non-relapse mortality
      and the incidence and severity of infectious complications using this treatment strategy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

      ARM I (indolent disease):

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) on days -4
      to -2 and undergo TBI on day 0.

      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo donor peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT)
      on day 0.

      IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive cyclosporine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) or IV every
      8-12 hours on days -3 to 56 with a taper to day 180 and mycophenolate mofetil PO BID or IV
      every 8-12 hours on days 0 to 27.

      ARM II (aggressive disease):

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate and undergo TBI as in Arm I.

      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo donor PBSCT on day 0.

      IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive cyclosporine PO BID or IV every 8-12 hours on days -3 to
      56 with a taper to day 70 and mycophenolate mofetil as in Arm I.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: N/A to 74 Years
Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or
             multiple myeloma who are not eligible for a curative autologous transplantation or
             who have received a prior autologous transplantation; patients with NHL or CLL must
             have failed prior therapy with an alkylating agent and/or fludarabine, or be at high
             risk of relapse; patients with multiple myeloma must have stage II or III disease and
             received prior chemotherapy

          -  Patients < 50 years of age with NHL, Hodgkin's disease (HD), CLL or multiple myeloma
             at high risk of regimen related toxicity through prior autologous transplant or
             through pre-existing medical conditions

          -  Patients < 75 years of age with other malignant diseases treatable by allogeneic bone
             marrow transplant (BMT) whom through pre-existing chronic disease affecting kidneys,
             liver, lungs, and heart are considered to be at high risk for regimen related
             toxicity using standard high dose regimens; the following diseases are the likely
             candidates

               -  Myelodysplastic syndromes

               -  Myeloproliferative syndromes

               -  Acute Leukemia with < 10% blasts

               -  Amyloidosis

          -  The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) Patient Care Conference (PCC) may
             approve patients with other malignancies or patients declining standard allografts
             for transplant following presentation and approval; centers outside the FHCRC that
             have a PCC or equivalent should obtain their Institutional approval; if there is not
             a comparable group at the Institution, please contact the FHCRC Principal
             Investigator for FHCRC approval through PCC

          -  DONOR: Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypically or phenotypically identical
             related donor
