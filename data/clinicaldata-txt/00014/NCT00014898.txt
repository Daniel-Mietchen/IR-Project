TITLE:
Attention Deficit Disorder and Exposure to Lead

CONDITION:
Attention Deficit Disorder

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      We are examining the past exposure to lead in 250 well characterized children with ADHD, and
      a suitable group of controls. Our measure of past exposure is bone lead levels obtained by
      XRay fluorescence spectroscopy, a relatively new way of estimating bone lead concentrations,
      and by inference, body lead burdens. By comparing the lead concentrations in these two
      groups, controlling for other factors which could confound, we will estimate odds ratios for
      ADHD given elevated bone lead, and estimate the contribution of lead to this disease of
      childhood.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
NONE

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 10 Years to 18 Years
Criteria:

        Case subjects are drawn from adolescents aged 10 to 18 previously seen at Western
        Psychiatric Institute and Clinic for evaluation, and meet the DSM-IIIR criteria for
        diagnosis of ADHD based on a structured parent interview and standardized parent and
        teacher rating scales. Cases were also systematically observed and evaluated in the summer
        treatment program between 1987 and 1996 at WPIC. Controls are demographically matched
        non-ADHD adolescents, recruited from surrounding communities and pediatric practices.
