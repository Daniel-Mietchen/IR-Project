TITLE:
Behavioral and Pharmacological Treatment for Insomnia

CONDITION:
Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders

INTERVENTION:
Cognitive-behavior therapy

SUMMARY:

      This study will evaluate the long- and short-term effects of cognitive-behavior therapy
      (CBT), alone and in combination with zolpidem (Ambien), for chronic insomnia.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Insomnia is a prevalent health concern which is often associated with functional
      impairments, reduced quality of life, and increased health-care costs. The proposed study
      may provide useful information about optimal models for integrating behavioral and
      pharmacological therapies for the clinical management of insomnia.

      Participants are randomly assigned to CBT or CBT plus medication. After the 6-week acute
      treatment phase, participants enter into a 6-month extended treatment phase. Of those
      treated with CBT alone initially, responders are randomized to extended CBT or no treatment.
      Of those receiving the combined CBT plus medication approach initially, responders are
      randomized to an extended treatment consisting of either CBT plus medication (used on an as
      needed schedule) or CBT alone (plus medication tapering). Outcome is evaluated across
      measures of sleep, clinical ratings, and several indices of daytime functioning. The
      measures are administered at baseline, at the end of the acute and extended treatment
      phases, and at 6, 12, and 24-month follow-up.
