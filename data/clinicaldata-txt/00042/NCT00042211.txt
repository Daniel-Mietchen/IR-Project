TITLE:
Preventing Depression in Patients With Macular Degeneration

CONDITION:
Depression

INTERVENTION:
Problem Solving Treatment

SUMMARY:

      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a Problem Solving Treatment in preventing
      depression in elderly patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      AMD is the most common cause of blindness in older adults. The disease limits the ability to
      read, see familiar faces, and walk independently. Almost 2 million persons (about 5 percent
      of the U.S. population over age 65) are now affected, and this number will triple by the
      year 2020. This study will target patients with neovascular AMD (NV-AMD), a form of AMD
      which can lead to sudden vision loss, substantial disability, and depression. Because
      depression is itself disabling and not likely to be recognized nor treated by
      ophthalmologists, preventing depression in people with NV-AMD is important.

      Patients are randomly assigned to either PST or a usual care control condition. The primary
      outcome measure is a DSM-IV diagnosis of depression. Patients are evaluated at baseline,
      Month 2 (immediately post-intervention), Month 6 (for the primary efficacy analysis), and
      Month 12 (to evaluate sustained effects). The study will also assess the impact of PST on
      levels of disability and vision-related quality of life.
