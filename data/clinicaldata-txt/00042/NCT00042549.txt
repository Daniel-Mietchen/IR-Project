TITLE:
Lithotripsy for the Treatment of Gallstones

CONDITION:
Cholelithiasis

INTERVENTION:
Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness and safety of using the Medstone
      lithotripter to treat single non-calcified gallstones from 4 to 20 mm in diameter.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      This study is a randomized, single-masked controlled trial in which the combination therapy
      of lithotripsy and the bile acid drug Actigall is compared to monotherapy with only
      Actigall. The primary objectives are, 1) To determine whether the use of the Medstone STS
      Lithotripter system in combination with the orally administered drug Actigall is more
      effective (as measured by percentages of stone free patients 6 months after randomization)
      in reducing single non-calcified radiolucent gallstones (from 4 to 20mm in diameter) than
      use of Actigall alone, and 2) To demonstrate that use of the Medstone lithotripsy system is
      safe (as measured by incidence of adverse events) for the intended purpose, when operated
      according to its labeling.
