Eating Disorder Prevention Programs

CONDITION:
Eating Disorders

INTERVENTION:
Dissonance Eating Disorder Prevention Program

SUMMARY:

      This study evaluated 2 eating disorder prevention programs designed to increase body
      satisfaction among adolescent females with body image concerns.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Adolescent girls with body dissatisfaction (N=481; SD=1.4) were randomized to a
      dissonance-based thin-ideal internalization reduction program, healthy weight control
      program, expressive-writing control condition, or assessment-only control condition.
      Dissonance participants showed significantly greater decreases in thin-ideal
      internalization, body dissatisfaction, negative affect, eating disorder symptoms, and
      psychosocial impairment, and lower risk for eating pathology onset through 2-3 year
      follow-up than assessment-only controls. Dissonance participants showed greater decreases in
      thin-ideal internalization, body dissatisfaction, and psychosocial impairment than
      expressive-writing controls. Healthy weight participants showed greater decreases in
      thin-ideal internalization, body dissatisfaction, negative affect, eating disorder symptoms,
      and psychosocial impairment, less increases in weight, and lower risk for eating pathology
      and obesity onset through 2-3 year follow-up than assessment-only controls. Healthy weight
      participants showed greater decreases in thin-ideal internalization and weight than
      expressive writing controls. Dissonance participants showed a 60% reduction in risk for
      eating pathology onset and healthy weight participants showed a 61% reduction in risk for
      eating pathology onset and a 55% reduction in risk for obesity onset relative to
      assessment-only controls through 3-year follow-up, implying that the effects are clinically
      important and enduring.
