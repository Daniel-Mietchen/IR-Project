TITLE:
Evaluation of Efficacy, Safety and Tolerability of Targretin Capsules in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer

CONDITION:
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer

INTERVENTION:
bexarotene with carboplatin and paclitaxel

SUMMARY:

      This study evaluates the use of Targretin capsules (bexarotene) in combination with standard
      chemotherapy for the treatment of metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) in patients
      who have not yet received chemotherapy for their lung cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      This study evaluates the use of Targretin capsules (bexarotene) in combination with
      Carboplatin and Paclitaxel for the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer in
      patients who have not yet received chemotherapy for their lung cancer. Every patient
      receives a platinum-containing chemotherapy every three weeks for at least four chemotherapy
      cycles (approximately four months). Half of the patients are randomly assigned to receive
      Targretin capsules once daily in addition to the chemotherapy. The other half is randomized
      to receive a standard platinum-containing chemotherapy without Targretin capsules.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: N/A to N/A
Criteria:

        Patients must have:

          -  Pathologic (histologic or cytologic) confirmation of NSCLC

          -  Stage IIIB with malignant pleural effusion or Stage IV disease

          -  At least one measurable or evaluable NSCLC lesion that has not been previously
             irradiated unless radiation therapy was more than three weeks prior to entry in the
             study and the lesion has been shown to have progressed subsequent to the radiation
             therapy

          -  ECOG performance status 0 or 1

          -  Adequate organ system function

          -  Fasting serum triglycerides that are within the age-adjusted normal range (or
             normalized with appropriate intervention such as antilipid therapy prior to the
             initiation of Targretin capsule therapy).

        Patients must be able to complete at least four cycles of combination chemotherapy (i.e.,
        approximately four months)

        Patients must not have had:

          -  Brain metastasis

          -  Prior chemotherapy for NSCLC

          -  Prior platinum-based chemotherapy for any indication
