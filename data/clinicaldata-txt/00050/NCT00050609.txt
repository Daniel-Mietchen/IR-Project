TITLE:
Study of Tadalafil for the Treatment of Diabetic Patients With Symptoms of Upset Stomach and Delayed Stomach Emptying

CONDITION:
Gastroparesis

INTERVENTION:
tadalafil

SUMMARY:

      The purposes of this study are to determine whether an experimental drug known as tadalafil
      can reduce symptoms of dyspepsia (fullness after eating, inability to finish a regular meal,
      bloating, discomfort or pain in the upper abdomen, belching after meals, nausea, vomiting)
      in diabetic patients, and/or reduce the amount of time the stomach takes to empty the
      contents of a standard meal. The safety of tadalafil given once daily for 8 weeks in this
      population will also be studied.
