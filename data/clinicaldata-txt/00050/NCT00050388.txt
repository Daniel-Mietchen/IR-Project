TITLE:
Phase II Trial of Allovectin-7 for Head and Neck Cancer

CONDITION:
Head and Neck Cancer

INTERVENTION:
Allovectin-7

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this clinical trial is to determine if Allovectin-7, an experimental
      gene-based immunotherapy, can shrink head and neck tumors. The trial will also examine if
      treatment can boost the immune system and if this treatment can improve the time to disease
      progression.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Treatment - If you take part in this trial you will be treated for about four weeks. You
      will receive an injection of Allovectin-7 by needle, directly into your tumor. This will be
      repeated 14 days later. The injections may be given in a doctor's office. A week later, you
      will undergo surgery to remove the tumor. Your tumor will be measured before Allovectin-7
      treatment and before surgery to see if Allovectin-7 was effective in shrinking it. This
      will be done by general physical exams and scans (such as X-ray scans). There will also be
      tests on the removed tumor to see if Allovectin-7 helped to boost the immune system to
      attack the cancer.
