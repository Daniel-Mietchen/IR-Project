TITLE:
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Adult Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder

CONDITION:
Attention Deficit Disorder With Hyperactivity

INTERVENTION:
Cognitive behavioral therapy

SUMMARY:

      This study will determine the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in
      treating the symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults who have
      not responded to drug treatment.

      Study hypothesis: CBT is an effective treatment for adult ADHD.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      ADHD, previously believed to be a disorder of childhood, affects as many as 5 percent of
      adults. Adults with ADHD are at high risk for academic and occupational underachievement,
      relationship difficulties, and reduced quality of life. This study will determine whether
      CBT is more effective than drug therapy in treating ADHD symptoms in adults who have been
      resistant to previous drug therapies.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive 12 to 15 weekly sessions of either CBT or
      drug therapy which may include new or previously taken drugs. Questionnaires will be used to
      assess participants' ADHD symptoms at study start and at study completion.
