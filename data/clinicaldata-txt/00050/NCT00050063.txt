TITLE:
Effects of Therapeutic HIV Vaccination on Control of HIV After Discontinuation of Anti-HIV Drugs

CONDITION:
HIV Infections

INTERVENTION:
Therapeutic vaccinations from A5058s

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether therapeutic HIV vaccines can help the
      immune system control HIV viral load after anti-HIV drugs are discontinued.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      This study is a rollover study for patients who participated in A5058s: Augmentation of
      HIV-Specific Helper and CTL Responses Through Therapeutic Vaccination in Individuals
      Receiving Potent Suppressive Antiretroviral Therapies. In A5058s, patients received a series
      of therapeutic vaccinations to elicit HIV-specific immune responses. This study will examine
      whether these vaccine-induced responses can control viral load in the absence of
      antiretroviral therapy (ART).

      Upon study entry, patients will discontinue ART. During the first 6 weeks of the study,
      viral load will be monitored weekly and CD4+ T-cell counts will be monitored every other
      week. Viral load and CD4+ T-cell counts will be measured every other week from Week 6
      through Week 24, then monthly until patients restart ART or until Week 48. Patients who
      reinitiate ART for any reason will be registered to Step 2 and followed for 10 weeks.

          -  Continuation of the same stable antiretroviral treatment that was given in A5058s for
             the last 3 months prior to A5172 entry, unless the regimen was changed for toxicity
             in the absence of virologic failure

          -  No less than 6 weeks and no more than 18 weeks since the last injection on A5058s
             prior to A5172 entry

          -  CD4+ T-cell count > 300 cells/mm3 obtained within 30 days prior to study entry

          -  HIV-1 RNA < 500 copies/ml obtained within 30 days prior to study entry

          -  Agreement to use approved methods of contraception

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy or breast-feeding

          -  Any of the following within 30 days prior to entry: acute infection requiring

             medical illness, or surgery

          -  Symptomatic chronic infections other than HIV

          -  Malignancy that may require systemic therapy

          -  History of lymph node irradiation

          -  Use of immunoenhancing or immunosuppressive drugs within 30 days prior to entry, or
             any underlying disease of sufficient severity that these excluded drugs may be
             prescribed

          -  Hydroxyurea within 30 days prior to study entry

          -  Use of GM-CSF, G-CSF, M-CSF, IFN, IL-2, or other cytokines within 30 days prior to
             study entry

             requirements

          -  Serious illness requiring systemic treatment and/or hospitalization until patient
             either completes therapy or is clinically stable on therapy for at least 30 days
             prior to study entry
