TITLE:
Study of ONTAK (Denileukin Diftitox) in Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (CTCL) Patients

CONDITION:
Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous

INTERVENTION:
ONTAK

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two dose levels of ONTAK
      (denileukin diftitox) in treating patients who have recurrent or persistent cutaneous T-cell

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 18 Years to N/A
Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histopathologically confirmed recurrent or persistent CTCL as determined by reference
             pathology lab;

          -  Patient must have had 1 to 3 prior CTCL therapies. Repeated use of the same agent is
             considered to be 1 therapy unless it is part of a different combination regimen. Only

             not considered a therapy;

          -  Interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) expression on at least 20% of tumor cells as
             determined by immunohistochemistry.

          -  Stage IA - III disease and unlikely to progress during the first month on study. Life
             expectancy of at least 12 months.

          -  Measurable or evaluable disease. Lymph node involvement no greater than LN2. No CTCL
             involvement of bone marrow.

          -  No active CNS disease, kidney or liver disease, significant pulmonary disease, or
             cardiac disease.

          -  No systemic infections;

          -  Willingness to be randomized to a placebo treatment only arm;

          -  ECOG performance status 0 or 1;

        Exclusion Criteria:

         Patients must not have previously received treatment with DAB389IL-2 or DAB486IL 2
        (previous candidate compound evaluated in a clinical setting).
