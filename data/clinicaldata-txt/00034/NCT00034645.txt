TITLE:
Prophylaxis Trial in High Risk Allogenic Stem Cell Transplant Recipients With Graft vs. Host Disease

CONDITION:
Mycoses

INTERVENTION:
Posaconazole oral suspension

SUMMARY:

      This trial is in high risk patients to determine the safety, tolerance and efficacy of
      posaconazole (POZ) vs. fluconazole in the prophylaxis against development of invasive fungal
      infections (IFI).
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      This study is designed to determine the safety, tolerance and efficacy of POZ used as
      prophylaxis of IFI in high-risk subjects with Grade II-IV acute graft vs. host disease
      (GVHD) or extensive chronic GVHD. The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of
      SCH56592 vs fluconazole in preventing proven or probable IFI within the time period from
      randomization to 16 weeks after the start of treatment with study drug.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 13 Years to 65 Years
Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Hematopoietic progenitor cell transplant subjects with chronic or Grade II-IV acute
             GVHD being treated with high dose immunosuppressive therapy.

          -  One of the following to the subject's prior immunosuppressive regimen:

               1. at least 1mg per kg per day of methylprednisolone or equivalent,

               2. Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) for the therapy of acute GVHD,

               3. Tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, or other steroid-sparing immunosuppressive
                  regimen.
