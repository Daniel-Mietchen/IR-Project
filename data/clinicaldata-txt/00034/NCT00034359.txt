TITLE:
Safety and Antiviral Activity Study of ACH-126,443 (Beta-L-Fd4C) in Treatment Naive Adults With Chronic Hepatitis B Virus Infection

CONDITION:
Hepatitis B, Chronic

INTERVENTION:
ACH-126, 443 (beta-L-Fd4C)

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and anti-HBV activity of ACH-126, 443
      (beta-L-Fd4C) in comparison to lamivudine or placebo in treatment naive adults with chronic
      Hepatitis B infection.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Evaluation of safety and antiviral activity of 3 dose levels of ACH-126, 443 vs. lamivudine
      and placebo over 12 weeks of treatment in the population described.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All

          -  HBe-antigen positive

          -  HIV negative

          -  Basic hematologic and chemistry parameters within acceptable limits (defined in
             protocol

          -  No need for excluded medications

          -  Hepatitis C co-infection

          -  Concurrent systemic antiviral treatment

          -  Previous antiviral treatment for HBV infection within 6 months prior to randomization
             or treatment with 3TC for more than 6 months at any time in the past

          -  Previous therapy with agents with significant systemic myelosuppressive or cytotoxic
             potential within 3 months of study start or the expected need for such therapy at
             study start

          -  ALT>7.0 times the upper limit of normal

          -  Any clinical condition or prior therapy that, in the Investigators opinion, would
             make the subject unsuitable for the study or unable to comply with the dosing
             requirements
