TITLE:
PK/PD Study of Posaconazole for Empiric Treatment of Invasive Fungal Infections in Neutropenic Patients or Treatment of Refractory Invasive Fungal Infections (Study P01893)

CONDITION:
Mycoses

INTERVENTION:
Posaconazole oral suspension

SUMMARY:

      This phase II study will be conducted to:

        1. evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerance, and efficacy of different dosing
           schedules of Posaconazole in immunocompromised hosts with a variety of refractory
           invasive fungal infections or in subjects who require empiric antifungal therapy and

        2. identify the dosing schedule that provides the most consistent therapeutic drug
           exposure in this patient population.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      This is an open-label, randomized, parallel group, study of pharmacokinetics, safety,
      tolerance, and efficacy of Posaconazole in the treatment of immunocompromised hosts with
      refractory invasive fungal infections or in subjects who require empiric antifungal therapy.

      The projected number of subjects planned for enrollment is 100 evaluable subjects. The
      number of planned study sites is approximately ten in the United States and approximately
      eight in the rest of the world.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 13 Years to 65 Years
Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A proven, either probable or possible invasive fungal infection which is refractory
             to standard antifungal therapies.

          -  Subjects who received >72 hours of systemic empiric antibacterial therapy and are
             neutropenic (<500 neutrophils per mm3 and, have had fever that has reached an oral
             temperature >38c (or >100.4f)twice in the last 48 hours, or

        have a recurrence of fever (oral temperature, >38c or >100.4F) while receiving broad
        spectrum antibacterial therapy after prior resolution of fever while on antibacterial
        therapy.

          -  Able to take oral medication or take medication via enteral feeding tube.
