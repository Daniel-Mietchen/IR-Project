TITLE:
Stem Cell Transplantation After Reduced-Dose Chemotherapy for Patients With Sickle Cell Disease or Thalassemia

CONDITION:
Hemoglobinopathies

INTERVENTION:
Busulfan

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to find out if using a lower dose of chemotherapy before stem
      cell transplantation can cure patients of sickle cell anemia or thalassemia while causing
      fewer severe side effects than conventional high dose chemotherapy with transplantation.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Hemoglobinopathies, such as sickle cell disease and thalassemia major, are genetic diseases
      associated with significant morbidity and premature death. Allogeneic bone marrow
      transplantation (BMT) is the only potential cure for severe hemoglobinopathies. Typical
      regimens have used high doses of chemotherapy or chemo-radiotherapy to ablate recipient
      hematopoiesis and to prevent graft rejection. The widespread use of this treatment has been
      limited by toxicity, risk of end-organ damage, and donor availability. This study will use a
      nonmyeloablative regimen of fludarabine and busulfan to attempt to generate consistent
      engraftment with donor hematopoietic stem cells in patients with severe hemoglobinopathy.

      G-CSF mobilization of the donor's peripheral blood white blood cells will precede donor
      apheresis. A nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen of fludarabine and busulfan will be
      administered to patients prior to allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell infusions. FK506 and
      prednisone will be administered for graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Patients
      will be evaluated for engraftment, donor: host hematopoietic chimerism, toxicity, and
      hemoglobinopathy.

                  hours

               -  Recurrent vaso-occlusive pain (2 episodes or more per year) or recurrent
                  priapism

               -  Sickle nephropathy (moderate or severe proteinuria or a glomerular filtration
                  rate 30-50 percent of normal predicted value)

               -  Bilateral proliferative retinopathy and major visual impairment in at least 1
                  eye

               -  Osteonecrosis of multiple joints

          -  Patients with thalassemia should have 1 or more of the following:

               -  Transfusion dependence, defined as a transfusion requirement of greater than or
                  equal to 6 units of packed red blood cells over the past 12 months

               -  Iron overload, defined as serum ferritin greater than 500 mcg/L in the absence
                  of infection or biopsy-proven iron overload

               -  Presence of 2 or more alloantibodies against red cell antigens

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Acute hepatitis (transaminases greater than 3 times the normal value)

          -  Cardiac ejection fraction less than 30 percent

          -  Severe renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate less than 30 percent of predicted
             normal value)

          -  Severe residual functional neurologic impairment (other than hemiplegia alone)

          -  Seropositivity for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
