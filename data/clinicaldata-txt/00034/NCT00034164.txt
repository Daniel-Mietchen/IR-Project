TITLE:
Safety and Efficacy of S-8184 in Second Line Treatment of Relapsed Stage IIIB or IV Non Small Cell Lung Cancer

CONDITION:
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung

INTERVENTION:
S-8184 Paclitaxel Injectable Emulsion

SUMMARY:

      Phase IIA, multicenter, dose escalation study evaluating the safety and efficacy of weekly
      S-8184 paclitaxel injectable emulsion in second line treatment of patients with relapsed
      stage IIIB or IV non small cell lung cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      The goals of this study are to determine the objective response rate, to determine time to
      disease progression, duration of response, and survival, and to identify the maximum
      tolerated weekly dose and principal toxicities of S-8184 in this patient population.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 18 Years to N/A
