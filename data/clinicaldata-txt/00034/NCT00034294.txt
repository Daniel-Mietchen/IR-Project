TITLE:
A Study of GT160-246 Versus Vancomycin in Patients With Clostridium Difficile-Associated Diarrhea

CONDITION:
Clostridium Difficile-Associated Diarrhea

INTERVENTION:
GT160-246

SUMMARY:

      Approximately 300 patients will be entered into this study taking place throughout the
      United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. This study aims to determine if an
      investigational drug is safe and effective for treating the symptoms of C.
      difficile-associated diarrhea and lowering the risk of repeat episodes of diarrhea. The
      investigational drug will be evaluated in comparison to current standard antibiotic
      treatment, so all patients will receive active medication.

      All study-related care is provided including doctor visits, physical exams, laboratory tests
      and study medication. Total length of participation is approximately 10 weeks.
