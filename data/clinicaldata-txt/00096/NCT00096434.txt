TITLE:
Sorafenib in Treating Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer

CONDITION:
Male Breast Cancer

INTERVENTION:
sorafenib tosylate

SUMMARY:

      This phase II trial is studying how well sorafenib works in treating patients with
      metastatic breast cancer. Sorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the
      enzymes necessary for their growth and by stopping blood flow to the tumor.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the tumor response rate in patients with metastatic breast cancer previously
      treated with an anthracycline- and/or taxane-containing regimen receiving sorafenib.

      II. Assess the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients. III. Determine time to
      disease progression and survival time of patients treated with this drug.

      IV. Correlate pre-treatment levels of activated ERK1/2 with tumor response in patients
      treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 months until disease progression and then every 3 months for
      up to 5 years.
