TITLE:
Study Evaluating Darbepoetin Alfa in Subjects With Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Receiving Dialysis

CONDITION:
Kidney Disease

INTERVENTION:
Darbepoetin Alfa

SUMMARY:

      The proposed study is designed to test a novel dosing paradigm that would facilitate the
      treatment of anemia in CKD patients on dialysis. Anemic patients on hemo and peritoneal
      dialysis who have achieved and maintained target hemoglobin (Hb) on every other week (Q2W)
      dosing of darbepoetin alfa will have the dosing interval extended to once monthly (QM)
      dosing.
