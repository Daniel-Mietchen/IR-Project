TITLE:
Effect of the Atazanavir (ATV) 150L Mutation on Subsequent Treatment Response in HIV Infected Subjects

CONDITION:
HIV Infection

INTERVENTION:
LPV/RTV + 2NRTIs

SUMMARY:

      This study will compare the response of subjects who failed a first-line ATV-containing
      regimen and who have the 150L-containing virus to subsequent protease inhibitor
      (PI)-containing therapy with that of a cohort who has failed a first-line reverse
      transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), and is subsequently receiving PI-containing therapy.

Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently on a first-line antiretroviral regimen containing ATV with a confirmed
             rebound and a genotype that verifies the presence of an 150L mutation OR on a
             first-line regimen containing an NNRTI and PI-naive, with a confirmed rebound

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women of child bearing potential who are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable
             method to avoid pregnancy for the entire study period and for up to 8 weeks after the

          -  Active alcohol or substance abuse sufficient, in the investigator's opinion, to
             prevent adequate adherence to study therapy or to increase the risk of developing
             pancreatitis or chemical hepatitis.
