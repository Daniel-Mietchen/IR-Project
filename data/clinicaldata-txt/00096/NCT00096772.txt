TITLE:
Collection of Blood Samples From HIV Infected People

CONDITION:
HIV Infections

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to collect blood samples from HIV infected individuals for use
      in future genetic studies.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Genetic differences among people with HIV may account for differences in disease progression
      and response to antiretroviral therapy. The Terry Beirn Community Programs for Clinical
      Research on AIDS (CPCRA) was created to conduct studies in HIV infected communities and
      particularly in people of color, women, and injection drug users. This study will collect
      whole blood samples from HIV infected individuals. The samples will be used in future CPCRA
      studies comparing human genetic factors with clinical data from other CPCRA studies.
