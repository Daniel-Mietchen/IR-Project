TITLE:
A Study to Evaluate Avastin in Patients Treated in a Previous Genentech-Sponsored Cancer Study

CONDITION:
Breast Cancer

INTERVENTION:
Avastin (bevacizumab)

SUMMARY:

      This is a multicenter, open-label extension study. Subjects who have received rhuMAb VEGF
      therapy in Study AVF2107g, AVF2119g, or AVF2192g and who completed the parent study are
      eligible for inclusion in this trial. Subjects who have received placebo in Study AVF2107g
      or AVF2192g are also eligible.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
NONE

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: N/A to N/A
Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent

          -  Previous participation in and completion of one of the following Genentech-sponsored
             rhuMAb VEGF Phase II or Phase III cancer studies: AVF2107g, AVF2119g, or AVF2192g

          -  Use of an effective means of contraception in men and in women of childbearing
             potential

          -  For subjects who received placebo in the parent study, current antitumor therapy not
             exceeding third-line treatment for disease progression

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Compromised renal or hepatic function, as defined in the parent protocol

          -  EGOG status of 3 or greater

          -  Current, recent (within 4 weeks of the first infusion of this study), or planned
             participation in an experimental drug study other than a Genentech-sponsored rhuMAb
             VEGF cancer study

          -  ANC of <1500/uL

          -  Platelet count of <75,000/uL

          -  International normalized ration (INR) >=1.5 (except those subjects who have been
             given approval to receive full-dose warfarin plus rhuMAb VEGF)

          -  Total bilirubin of >1.6 mg/dL for patients receiving irinotecan, for all others total
             bilirubin of >2.0 mg/dL

          -  AST or ALT >5 times upper limit of normal for subjects with documented liver
             metastases; >2.5 times the upper limit of normal for subjects without evidence of
             liver metastases

          -  Serum creatinine of >2.0 mg/dL

          -  Hemoglobin of <9 gm/dL (may be transfused or receive epoetin alfa [e.g., Epogen] to
             maintain or exceed this level)

          -  Inability to comply with study and/or follow-up procedures

          -  History of other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or
             clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition
             that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that might affect the
             interpretation of the results of the study or render the subject at high risk from
             treatment complications

          -  Any unresolved or irreversible rhuMAb VEGF-related ongoing serious adverse event
             occurring during the parent study

          -  Clinically significant cardiovascular disease (e.g., uncontrolled hypertension [blood
             pressure of >160/110 mmHg on medication], previous myocardial infarction, unstable
             angina), New York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade II or greater congestive heart
             failure, serious cardiac dysrhythmia requiring medication, or peripheral vascular
             disease (Grade II or greater)

          -  History or evidence upon physical examination of CNS disease (e.g., primary brain
             tumor, seizures not controlled with standard medical therapy, any brain metastases,
             or history of stroke)

          -  Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days
             prior to Day 0, or anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during the
             course of the study

          -  Fine needle aspirations or core biopsies within 7 days prior to Day 0

          -  Chronic, daily treatment with aspirin (>325 mg/day) or nonsteroidal anti inflammatory
             medications (of the kind known to inhibit platelet function at doses used to treat
             chronic inflammatory diseases)

          -  Pregnancy (positive pregnancy test) or lactation

          -  Proteinuria at baseline or clinically significant impairment of renal function

          -  Serious, nonhealing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture

          -  Evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy
