TITLE:
Tight Glycemic Control in Critical Care Patients

CONDITION:
Critical Illness

INTERVENTION:
Tight control of blood glucose levels

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of tight control of serum glucose levels
      with an intensive insulin treatment in patients hospitalized in an intensive care unit with
      medical and surgical patients.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Reduction of morbidity-mortality in critical care patients with tight glycemic control had
      been proven in surgical patients only.

      Study Hypothesis: In critical care patients, medical or surgical, a glucose serum level
      between 80 - 110 mg/dL means a lower mortality than patients with glucose levels of more
      than 110 mg/dL.
