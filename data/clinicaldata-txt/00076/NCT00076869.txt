TITLE:
MK0991 in Combination With Standard Antifungal Agent(s) for the Treatment of Salvage Invasive Aspergillosis (0991-037)

CONDITION:
Aspergillosis

INTERVENTION:
MK0991, caspofungin acetate

SUMMARY:

      Invasive aspergillosis is a type of fungal infection typically identified in very sick
      patients (for example, patients with cancer or who have had a bone marrow or organ
      transplant). This study will seek to enroll patients (16 years of age or older) with
      invasive aspergillosis infections (involving organs or deep tissues) who are failing or
      could not tolerate standard antifungal therapy. Your doctor will make this determination
      based upon specific study criteria. Patients that fulfill all study criteria will be treated
      daily with both the investigational drug and another antifungal agent. The choice of the
      other agent is up to your doctor. This investigational drug is approved for the treatment of
      invasive aspergillosis by itself. The safety and efficacy of this investigational drug, in
      combination with other agents is not known.
