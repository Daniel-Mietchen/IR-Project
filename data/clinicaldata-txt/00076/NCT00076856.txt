TITLE:
Temozolomide for Treatment of Brain Metastases From Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (Study P03247)

CONDITION:
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung

INTERVENTION:
Temozolomide

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate improvement in overall survival for the
      combination of whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) plus temozolomide (TMZ) versus WBRT
      alone. Secondary objective is to demonstrate an improvement in the time to radiological CNS
      progression with the addition of TMZ to WBRT.
