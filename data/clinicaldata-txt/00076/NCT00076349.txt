TITLE:
SDX-105 in Combination With Rituxan for Patients With Relapsed Indolent or Mantle Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL)

CONDITION:
Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma

INTERVENTION:
bendamustine and rituximab

SUMMARY:

      SUMMARY:

      This is an open label study combining Rituxan and SDX-105. Rituxan will be given on day 1
      followed by a 30-60 minute intravenous infusion of SDX-105 on day 2 and day 3. Treatment
      will repeat every 21 days (a cycle). Treatment can continue for up to 6 cycles (about 4
      months) if tumor status improves and there are no unacceptable side effects. Patients will
      be followed for up to 2 years or until disease progression.

      RATIONALE:

      Rituxan has been shown to increase the sensitivity of cells to chemotherapy. The combination
      of SDX-105 and Rituxan has been effective in both the laboratory and in a recent clinical
      study with Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients.

      PURPOSE:

      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of SDX-105 plus Rituxan in patients
      with Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who have relapsed after taking Rituxan.
