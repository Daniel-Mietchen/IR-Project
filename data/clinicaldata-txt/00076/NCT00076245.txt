TITLE:
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for the Treatment of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)

CONDITION:
Seasonal Affective Disorder

INTERVENTION:
Light Therapy

SUMMARY:

      This study will assess the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in treating
      seasonal affective disorder (SAD), commonly called the "winter blues."
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      SAD is a condition in which people experience depression as a result of seasonal variations
      in sunlight. Although light therapy is a common treatment for SAD, a large proportion of
      people with SAD are resistant to this treatment. CBT is effective for nonseasonal depressive
      disorders, but its use for SAD has not been thoroughly explored. This study will determine
      whether CBT, alone and combined with light therapy, is as effective as light therapy alone
      in reducing SAD symptoms.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to light therapy, CBT, a combination of
      light therapy and CBT, or a control group (no therapy) for 6 weeks. CBT will be conducted
      twice a week; light therapy will be conducted twice a day. Assessments will be made before,
      during, and after the study treatment. Depression scales, questionnaires, and behavioral
      tasks will be used to assess the depressive symptoms of participants. A 6-month and 1-year
      follow-up visit will also be conducted. During the follow-up visits, participants will be
      interviewed and will complete a questionnaire and a survey.
