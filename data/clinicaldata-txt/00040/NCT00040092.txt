TITLE:
A Study to Test the Effectiveness of Virulizin Given in Combination With Standard Chemotherapy for Pancreatic Cancer

CONDITION:
Pancreatic Cancer

INTERVENTION:
Virulizin

SUMMARY:

      Virulizin is an immunotherapy drug preparation that is thought to stimulate the patient's
      immune system, which in turn may slow the growth of tumors. It is presented in vials as a
      sterile preparation for IM injection. The purpose of the trial is to investigate if
      Virulizin in combination with gemcitabine provides better efficacy than gemcitabine alone
      (with placebo) against pancreatic cancer.Virulizin efficacy will continue to be assessed if
      chemotherapy is changed to 5-Fluorouracil.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      A Phase III, Double-blind, Multicenter, Randomized Study in Chemonaive Patients with Locally
      Advanced or Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer to Compare a Combination Therapy of Virulizin plus
      Gemcitabine versus Placebo plus Gemcitabine; Optional Secondline Therapy may Include
      Continuation of Virulizin or Placebo, Alone or in Combination with 5-Fluorouracil.

      Patients who have not received any prior chemotherapy will be randomized to receive
      Gemcitabine plus Virulizin versus Gemcitabine plus placebo in a double blind fashion. On
      disease progression patients may be switched to 5-Fluorouracil and continue to receive
      Virulizin or placebo. Patients may continue Virulizin alone, if clinically indicated when
      5-Fluorouracil is discontinued.
