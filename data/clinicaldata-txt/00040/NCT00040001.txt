TITLE:
Safety and Efficacy Study of an A1-Adenosine Receptor Agonist to Slow Heart Rate in Atrial Fibrillation

CONDITION:
Atrial Fibrillation

INTERVENTION:
DTI-0009

SUMMARY:

      This study is designed to evaluate the safety of DTI-0009 in patients with atrial
      fibrillation and to find the dose of DTI-0009 that lowers heart rates in patients with
      atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
NONE

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 18 Years to 85 Years
Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Primary diagnosis of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response of any
             duration as documented by an ECG

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Presence of other significant cardiac disease or history of significant neurological,
             hepatic,cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal, thyroid, respiratory, rheumatologic,
             or hematologic disease or impairment that in the investigators judgment is serious
             enough to preclude the patient from safely participating in the study
