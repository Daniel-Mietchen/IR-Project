TITLE:
Safety and Antiviral Study of ACH-126, 443 (Beta-L-Fd4C) in the Treatment of Adults With HIV Infection and Modestly Detectable Viral Load.

CONDITION:
HIV Infections

ACH126-443 (Beta-L-Fd4C)

SUMMARY:

      To determine safety and efficacy of ACH-126,443 on the treatment of adults with HIV

      antiretroviral therapy including 3TC.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

          -  Demonstration of initial viral suppression and subsequent rebound to be defined as an
             initial virological drop of at least 0.5 Logs on a 3TC-containing regimen

          -  CD4 > 200 cells/mm3

          -  Basic hematologic and chemistry parameters within acceptable limits (defined in
             protocol)

          -  All women of child bearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy
             test (minimum sensitivity of 25 IU/L of b-HCG) within 72 hours prior to the start of
             study medication

          -  No active opportunistic infection requiring treatment

          -  Subject must be able to provide written informed consent

          -  Baseline laboratory values measured within 28 days of initiating study drug as
             follows:

          -  HGB9.0g/dl or HCT27% (in the absence of blood transfusions or erythropoietin
             treatment in the preceding two weeks

          -  Absolute neutrophil count1000 cells/mm(^3) (in the absence of on-going G-CSF therapy

          -  Platelet count 75,000/mm(^3)

          -  AST <7.0 times the upper limit of normal

          -  ALT ,7.0 times the upper limit of normal

          -  Serum creatinine <1.1 times the upper limit of normal

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Evidence of active HBV infection as demonstrated by HBsAg positivity

          -  Hepatitis C co-infection

          -  Concurrent systemic antiviral treatment

          -  Previous therapy with agents with significant systemic myelosuppressive or cytotoxic
             potential within 3 months of study start or the expected need for such therapy at
             study start.

          -  Alcohol abuse

          -  Pregnancy or breast-feeding

          -  Inability to tolerate oral medication

          -  AST > 7.0 times the upper limit of normal

          -  ALT > 7.0 times the upper limit of normal

          -  Any clinical condition or prior therapy that, in the Investigators opinion, would
             make the subject unsuitable for the study or unable to comply with the dosing
             requirements.

          -  Use of any other drug or substance with anti-HBV activity
