TITLE:
Alemtuzumab, Fludarabine Phosphate, and Low-Dose Total Body Irradiation Before Donor Stem Cell Transplantation in Treating Patients With Hematological Malignancies

CONDITION:
Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia With 11q23 (MLL) Abnormalities

INTERVENTION:
alemtuzumab

SUMMARY:

      This phase II trial studies the side effects and the best dose of alemtuzumab when given
      together with fludarabine phosphate and low-dose total body irradiation (TBI) and how well
      it works before donor stem cell transplant in treating patients with hematological
      malignancies. Giving chemotherapy and low-dose TBI before a donor peripheral blood stem cell
      transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also stop the patient's immune
      system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. Also, monoclonal antibodies, such as
      alemtuzumab, can find cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances
      to them without harming normal cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused
      into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells,
      white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also
      make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving cyclosporine (CSP) and
      mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) after transplant may stop this from happening.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether stable allogeneic engraftment from related and unrelated human
      leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched stem cell donors can be safely established using a
      non-myeloablative conditioning regimen plus escalating doses of the anti-CD52 monoclonal
      antibody (mAb) Campath (alemtuzumab) in patients with hematologic malignancies.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the risk of occurrence of acute and chronic graft-vs-host disease (GVHD).

      II. Evaluate the risk/incidence of infections.

      III. Determine whether engraftment can be maintained with a single dose fludarabine, donor
      lymphocyte infusion (DLI) and continued MMF/CSP.

      IV. Evaluate the risk for disease progression and relapse.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of alemtuzumab.

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive alemtuzumab intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days
      -8 to -5 and fludarabine phosphate IV on days -4 to -2. Patients also undergo low-dose TBI
      on day 0.

      HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION (HSCT): Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood
      stem cell transplantation on day 0.

      IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive CSP IV or orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -3 to
      180 with taper to day 365 and MMF PO thrice daily (TID) on days 0-100 with taper to day 156.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
