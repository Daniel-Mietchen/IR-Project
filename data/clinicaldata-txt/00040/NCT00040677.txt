TITLE:
A Study of the Efficacy and Safety of ICA-17043 (With or Without Hydroxyurea) in Patients With Sickle Cell Anemia.

CONDITION:
Sickle Cell Disease

INTERVENTION:
Low Dose ICA-17043

SUMMARY:

      ICA-17043 is being developed for the chronic treatment of patients with sickle cell disease
      (SCD) in both adults and children. ICA-17043 is a potent and specific inhibitor of a channel
      in human red blood cells (RBCs) that blocks RBC dehydration. ICA-17043 is expected to
      inhibit RBC dehydration and thus should prevent or delay the sickling process. By reducing
      sickled cells, an improvement in anemia, a reduction in painful crises, and ultimately, less
      end-organ disease is anticipated.
