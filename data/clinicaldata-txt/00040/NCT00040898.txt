TITLE:
Sho-Saiko-To Following Removal of Liver Cancer By Embolization in Treating Patients With Liver Cancer That Cannot Be Surgically Removed

CONDITION:
Liver Cancer

INTERVENTION:
Sho-saiko-to

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: The Chinese herbal medicine Sho-saiko-to contains ingredients that may slow the
      growth of tumor cells and stimulate a person's immune system to help kill tumor cells. This
      may be an effective treatment following hepatic artery embolization.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of Sho-saiko-to following hepatic artery
      embolization in treating patients who have liver cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the overall survival of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma
           treated with Sho-saiko-to after ablation therapy with embolization vs historical
           control patients.

        -  Compare the liver function and alpha fetoprotein levels in patients treated with this
           drug vs historical control patients.

        -  Compare the intervention-free survival in patients treated with this drug vs historical
           control patients.

      OUTLINE: Beginning within 1 week after the first course of ablation therapy with
      embolization, patients receive oral Sho-saiko-to three times daily. Treatment with
      Sho-saiko-to continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 78 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24
      months.
