TITLE:
Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Colorectal Cancer

CONDITION:
Colorectal Cancer

INTERVENTION:
fluorouracil

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Giving drugs at the time of day that allows for the best drug
      response may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor
      cells.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to determine the best time to give irinotecan combined
      with fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin in treating patients who have colorectal
      cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the role of peak delivery time on the tolerability of irinotecan when
           administered with chronomodulated fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and oxaliplatin as
           first- or second-line therapy in patients with locoregional or metastatic colorectal
           cancer.

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center, WHO performance status (0-1 vs 2), and line of treatment (first vs
      second). Patients are randomized to receive irinotecan at 1 of 6 different times of the day.

      Patients receive irinotecan IV over 6 hours on day 1 and fluorouracil IV and leucovorin
      calcium IV over 11 hours followed by oxaliplatin IV over 11 hours on days 2-5. Courses
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 4 weeks until disease progression and then every 8 weeks
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 186 patients (31 per irinotecan administration time) will be
      accrued for this study within 2 years.
