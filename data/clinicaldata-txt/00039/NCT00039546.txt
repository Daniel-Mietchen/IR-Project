TITLE:
Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Women With Breast Cancer Who Have Undergone Surgery

CONDITION:
Breast Cancer

INTERVENTION:
cyclophosphamide

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is
      not yet known which chemotherapy regimen is more effective in treating women after surgery
      for breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of paclitaxel, epirubicin,
      and cyclophosphamide with or without gemcitabine in treating women who have undergone
      surgery for breast cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the 5-year and 10-year disease-free survival and overall survival of women with
           completely resected early stage breast cancer treated with adjuvant paclitaxel,
           epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide with or without gemcitabine.

        -  Compare the toxicity, dose-intensity, and tolerability of these regimens in these
           patients.

        -  Compare the serious adverse events in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to nodal
      status (negative vs 1-3 vs 4 or more), age (50 and under vs over 50), estrogen receptor
      status (negative vs weakly positive vs positive), concurrent radiotherapy (no vs yes), HER2
      status (3+ overexpression vs other vs not measured), and country. Patients are randomized to
      1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive epirubicin IV, cyclophosphamide IV, and paclitaxel IV over 3
           hours on day 1. Patients also receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8.
           Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel as in arm I.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 6 months, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually for 6 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3,000 patients (1,500 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study within 3-4 years.
