TITLE:
Safety and Efficacy of (PN-152,243)/PN-196,444 in the Prevention of Thrombocytopenia

CONDITION:
Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma

INTERVENTION:
(PN-152,243)/ PN-196,444

SUMMARY:

      Intensive chemotherapy is associated with significant thrombocytopenia, often requiring
      platelet transfusion to maintain platelet counts. This investigational drug has been
      demonstrated to increase platelet counts. This study will test the safety and efficacy of
      the investigational drug in the prevention of thrombocytopenia in patients with recurrent or
      refractory intermediate-grade or high-grade non-Burkitt's, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), or
      Hodgkin's disease receiving DHAP (Dexamethasone, high-dose Cytarabine, and Cisplatin)
      chemotherapy.
