TITLE:
PEG-Intron Plus Rebetol Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C Subjects Who Failed Response to Alpha-Interferon Plus Ribavirin (Study P02370)

CONDITION:
Hepatitis

INTERVENTION:
PegIntron (peginterferon alfa-2b; SCH 54031)

SUMMARY:

      The objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of PEG-Intron 1.5 ug/kg/wk
      plus REBETOL (ribavirin) 800-1400 mg/day in adults with chronic hepatitis C with moderate to
      severe liver fibrosis or cirrhosis who failed to respond to previous treatment with an alpha
      interferon in combination with ribavirin. Patients who do not respond to PEG-Intron plus
      REBETOL (ribavirin) will be enrolled in a long-term maintenance study to evaluate the
      effectiveness of PEG-Intron monotherapy versus no treatment for the prevention of disease
      progression (Protocols P02569 and P02570).
