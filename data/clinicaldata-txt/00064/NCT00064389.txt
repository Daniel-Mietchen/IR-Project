TITLE:
Long Term Safety Study of Levalbuterol and Racemic Albuterol in Subjects Twelve Years of Age and Older With Asthma

CONDITION:
Asthma

INTERVENTION:
levalbuterol tartrate HFA MDI

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of levalbuterol as compared to racemic
      albuterol based on the frequencies of adverse events reporting during a 12-month period of
      chronic dosing of adolescent and adult subjects with asthma.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      This was a randomized, open-label, active controlled, multicenter, parallel-group safety
      study in subjects 12 years of age and older with asthma. Subjects of appropriate age who
      completed the Phase III levalbuterol HFA MDI trials (Studies 051-353 or 051-355) were
      eligible to participate. Studies 051-353 and 051-355, both entitled "An Efficacy and Safety
      Study of Levalbuterol, Racemic Albuterol and Placebo in Subjects Twelve Years of Age and
      Older with Asthma" were multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and
      active-controlled, parallel-group studies of up to nine weeks in duration (a one-week
      single-blind placebo run in period followed by an eight-week double-blind treatment period).
      Subjects who completed Studies 051 353 and 051 355 but who were not immediately eligible to
      rollover into the current study could also participate but only after a 30-day washout. New
      subjects and subjects who participated in the Phase III trials who were not immediately
      eligible (ie, had a >30-day washout) were considered to be de novo subjects.Study
      participation included 10 study visits over a 12 month period.

      This study was previously posted by Sepracor Inc. In October 2009, Sepracor Inc. was
      acquired by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma., and in October 2010, Sepracor Inc's name was changed
      to Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.
