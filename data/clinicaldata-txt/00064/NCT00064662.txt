TITLE:
Comparison of Surgical Procedures to Reduce Urinary Stress Incontinence

CONDITION:
Urinary Incontinence

INTERVENTION:
Burch Modified Tanagho

SUMMARY:

      The primary aim of this clinical trial is to compare the treatment success for two surgical
      procedures that are frequently used and have similar cure rates, yet have not been compared
      directly to each other in a large, rigorously conducted randomized trial. The secondary aims
      of the trial are to compare other outcomes for the two surgical procedures, including
      quality of life, sexual function, satisfaction with treatment outcomes, complications, and
      need for other treatment(s)after surgery. Follow-up will be a minimum of two years and up to
      four years.
