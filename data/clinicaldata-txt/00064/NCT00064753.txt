TITLE:
Folic Acid for Vascular Outcome Reduction In Transplantation (FAVORIT)

CONDITION:
Chronic Kidney Disease

INTERVENTION:
High Dose Multivitamin

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to determine if lowering homocysteine
      levels in renal transplant recipients with a multivitamin will reduce the occurrence of
      cardiovascular disease outcomes.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      The hypothesis of the trial is as follows: Treatment with a high dose combination of folic
      acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 will reduce the rate of pooled arteriosclerotic
      cardiovascular disease outcomes (i.e., pooled occurrence of non-fatal and fatal
      arteriosclerotic outcomes, including coronary heart, cerebrovascular, and peripheral
      vascular disease events) relative to treatment with an identical multivitamin containing no
      folic acid, and Estimated Average Requirement amounts of vitamin B6, vitamin B12, among
      chronic, stable renal transplant recipients
