TITLE:
Safety and Tolerance Study of Oral Doses of CT53518 to Treat Patients With Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML)

CONDITION:
Acute Myelogenous Leukemia

INTERVENTION:
CT53518

SUMMARY:

      This is the first study of the drug CT53518 when given to humans. The purpose of this study
      is to determine the highest dose of CT53518 that can safely be given to patients with Acute
      Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) and to identify the side effects associated with taking the drug.
      The study will evaluate how CT53518 is absorbed, broken down, and eliminated by the body.
      Additionally, the study will evaluate the effects of the drug on a specific type of cell in
      bone marrow and blood, known as a blast.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      This is a Phase 1, open label, dose escalating study at five clinical sites to determine
      dose limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics, and the effect
      on the peripheral and bone marrow blast count of an oral 28-day course of CT53518 in
      patients with Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome. This study will
      confirm the tolerability and assess the effects on the peripheral and bone marrow blast
      count of an oral 28-day course of CT53518 at or near the maximum tolerated dose in patients
      with AML displaying a specified mutation of the FLT-3 gene, internal tandem duplication
      (ITD).

Gender: All
Age: 18 Years to N/A
Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Each patient must meet the following inclusion criteria to be eligible to participate in
        the study.

          -  Men and women who are over 18 years of age and have one of the following conditions:

               -  AML with relapse within 12 months of the completion of consolidation therapy who
                  are not to receive gemtuzumab-ozogamicin; or

               -  AML with relapse after 12 months of the completion of consolidation therapy for
                  whom, in the opinion of the investigator, the risk of alternative therapy
                  outweighs the possible benefit; or

               -  newly diagnosed AML refractory to conventional remission-induction chemotherapy
                  ("refractory" is defined as >10% blasts in blood and/or bone marrow upon
                  recovery from two cycles of standard cytarabine-based induction chemotherapy);
                  or

               -  newly diagnosed, or previously treated AML, greater than 60 years of age and not
                  or no longer a candidate for conventional remission-induction chemotherapy or
                  gemtuzumab-ozogamicin

          -  No reproductive potential (surgically, post- menopausal, or using two methods of
             contraception)

          -  Demonstrated FLT-3 gene, internal tandem duplication mutation

          -  ECOG performance status of 0 to 2

          -  Has not received cytoreductive drug therapy for at least 4 weeks, and has not
             received hydroxyurea within 24 hours prior to first dose of the study drug

          -  Has not received a bone marrow transplant or peripheral blood stem cell transplant
             within the last two months

          -  Able to read and give written informed consent and has signed a consent form approved
             by the Investigator's Institutional Review Board (IRB)

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients meeting any of the following criteria are not eligible to participate in the
        study:

          -  Participated in an investigational drug study in the last 30 days

          -  Serum Creatinine >2 mg/dL

          -  Evidence of a clinically significant liver disease by history, physical examination
             and/or laboratory data (e.g. transaminases exceeding 3 x ULN and/or total bilirubin >
             2 mg/dL

          -  Known to have used illicit drugs within the last 30 days

          -  Has an uncontrolled active infection

          -  Pregnant or nursing mother

          -  Candidate for conventional chemotherapy (except hydroxyurea), including growth
             factors or hormonal therapy for cancer

          -  Any concomitant disease or condition which could interfere with or for which the
             treatment might interfere with the conduct of the study the, or which would, in the
             opinion of the Investigator and/or Sponsor, increase the risk of the patient's
             participation in the study. This includes but is not limited to alcoholism, drug
             dependency or abuse, psychiatric disease.
