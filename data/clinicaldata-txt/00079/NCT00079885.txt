TITLE:
Study Evaluating Tigecycline vs Levofloxacin in Hospitalized With Community-Acquired Pneumonia

CONDITION:
Community Acquired Pneumonia

INTERVENTION:
tigecycline

SUMMARY:

      To compare the efficacy and safety of tigecycline with those of levofloxacin in the
      treatment of subjects with CAP requiring hospitalization. The co-primary efficacy endpoints
      in the study will be the clinical response in the clinically evaluable population and the
      clinical response in the clinical modified intent-to-treat population at the TOC visit. The
      primary efficacy analyses will first determine whether tigecycline is noninferior to
      levofloxacin. If tigecycline is found to be noninferior, the analyses will determine whether
      tigecycline is statistically better than levofloxacin.

Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female subjects  18 years of ag.

          -  Subjects hospitalized with CAP for whom IV antibiotic treatment is indicated

          -  The presence of fever (within 24 hours prior to randomization), defined as oral
             temperature >38C/100.4F, axillary temperature >38.1C/100.6F, tympanic temperature
             >38.5C/ 101.2F, or a rectal/core temperature >39C/102.2F OR hypothermia (within
             24 hours prior to randomization), core temperature <35C/95

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any concomitant condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude an
             evaluation of a response or make it unlikely that the contemplated course of therapy
             could be completed (eg, life expectancy <30 days)

          -  Hospitalization within 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms

          -  Residence in a long-term care facility or nursing home 14 days before the onset of
             symptoms
