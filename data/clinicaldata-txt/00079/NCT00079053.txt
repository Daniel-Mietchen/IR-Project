TITLE:
Adjuvant Erlotinib After Completing Chemoradiotherapy in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck

CONDITION:
Head and Neck Cancer

INTERVENTION:
erlotinib hydrochloride

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Erlotinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary
      for their growth. Giving erlotinib after chemoradiotherapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of adjuvant erlotinib
      when given after completing chemoradiotherapy in treating patients with locally advanced
      squamous cell carcinoma (cancer) of the head and neck.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the recommended dose of adjuvant erlotinib after the completion of
           chemoradiotherapy in patients with stage III, IVA, or IVB squamous cell carcinoma of
           the head and neck.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the effects of this drug on plasma and urinary angiogenic factors
           (specifically vascular endothelial growth factor receptor [VEGFR], VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and
           basic fibroblast growth factor levels) in these patients.

        -  Compare the disease-free survival of patients treated with this drug after
           chemoradiotherapy vs historical control patients treated with chemoradiotherapy alone.

        -  Correlate levels of angiogenic factors with initial blood vessel concentration in the
           tumor and the presence or absence of EGFRvIII mutation in patients treated with this
           drug.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral erlotinib once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for
      up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of erlotinib until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, an additional 8 patients are
      treated at that dose level.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks, every 12 weeks for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6-20 patients will be accrued for this study.
