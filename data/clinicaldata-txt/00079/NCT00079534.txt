TITLE:
Distant Healing for HIV/AIDS

CONDITION:
HIV Infections

INTERVENTION:
Non-local/distant healing or prayer

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether individuals praying at a distance (also
      known as "Distant Healing") can positively affect the health of people with HIV/AIDS.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Significant numbers of people with HIV/AIDS seek spiritual or psychic" treatment. Distant
      healing could potentially be of benefit to large numbers of HIV/AIDS patients, as it is
      widely available and requires no travel or other activity on the part of the patient.
      However, the treatment can be costly and has not yet been proven effective in a controlled
      clinical trial. This study will evaluate the efficacy of distant healing in patients with
      HIV/AIDS.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to either the distant healing group or
      a control group. All participants will have hour-long study visits at entry and Months 6 and
      12. At study visits, participants will complete a demographic questionnaire, self-report
      health and symptom inventory, quality of life assessment, and profile of mood states. Blood
      will be drawn at each study visit.
