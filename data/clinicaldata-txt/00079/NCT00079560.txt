TITLE:
Comparing the Effects of Smoked and Oral Marijuana in Individuals With HIV/AIDS

CONDITION:
HIV Infections

INTERVENTION:
dronabinol

SUMMARY:

      Smoked marijuana (MJ) and dronabinol (also known as THC or by the trade name Marinol) are
      used to increase appetite, food intake, and weight in patients with HIV who experience
      unintended weight loss. This study will compare the effects of MJ and Marinol use in
      marijuana smokers who are HIV infected.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Little is known about the efficacy and tolerability of oral THC versus smoked MJ in a
      clinically relevant population. Additionally, it is not clear how THC's effects vary as a
      function of the duration of treatment or the patient's current patterns of smoked MJ use.
      This study directly compares 3 doses of smoked marijuana and 3 doses of Marinol across a
      range of behavioral measures in HIV infected marijuana smokers.

      Outcome measures will include analysis of food intake, body composition, mood, physical
      symptoms (e.g., nausea, stomach pain), psychomotor task performance, and sleep.
