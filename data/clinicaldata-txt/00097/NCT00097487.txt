             (ULN)

          -  Adequate liver function, as indicated by bilirubin <=1.5 ULN and AST or ALT <2 ULN
             unless related to primary disease

          -  Use of an adequate means of birth control (women of childbearing potential)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Initiation of Herceptin >=4 weeks after beginning taxane chemotherapy

          -  Prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease

          -  History of significant cardiac disease or uncontrolled arrhythmias

          -  Ejection fraction of <50% or below the lower limit of normal

          -  Active infection

          -  Symptomatic or untreated brain metastases

          -  Pregnancy or lactation

          -  Concomitant malignancies or previous malignancies within the last 5 years, with the
