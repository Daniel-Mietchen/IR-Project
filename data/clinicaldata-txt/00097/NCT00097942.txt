TITLE:
Evaluation of the Safety and Efficacy of Memantine as Adjunctive Treatment in Schizophrenia Patients

CONDITION:
Schizophrenia

INTERVENTION:
memantine HCl

SUMMARY:

      Standard antipsychotic drug regimens do not fully address the impact of cognitive symptoms
      associated with schizophrenia. The NMDA receptor has been connected to the pathophysiology
      of schizophrenia. Memantine is an uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist. It is hypothesized
      that adjunctive therapy with memantine will reduce NMDA receptor hyperactivity, improving
      signal to noise ratio and thereby improving cognitive symptoms.
