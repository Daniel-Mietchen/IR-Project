TITLE:
A Study of Bevacizumab in Ovarian Cancer or Primary Peritoneal Cancer Where Doxil or Topotecan Therapy Has Failed

CONDITION:
Ovarian Cancer

INTERVENTION:
bevacizumab

SUMMARY:

      This is an open-label, single-arm, two-stage, multicenter Phase II study evaluating the
      efficacy and safety of bevacizumab in women with platinum resistant, advanced (Stage III or
      IV) EOC (epithelial ovarian cancer) or PPC (primary peritoneal cancer) that subsequently
      progressed either during treatment with Doxil or Hycamtin therapy or within 3 months of
      discontinuing treatment with Doxil or Hycamtin therapy.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
NONE

          -  Measurable disease with at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at
             least one dimension (longest dimension recorded) according to RECIST (with the
             exception that spiral CT scans of up to 8-mm slice thickness will be accepted)

          -  Recovered from prior cancer therapy (XRT, surgery, chemotherapy)

          -  ECOG performance status 0 or 1

          -  Life expectancy >12 weeks

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Four or more treatment regimens

          -  Prior therapy with bevacizumab or other VEGF pathway-targeted therapy

          -  Current, recent (within 4 weeks of the first infusion of bevacizumab), or planned
             treatment with an experimental drug other than this Genentech-sponsored bevacizumab
             cancer study

          -  Screening clinical laboratory values: Granulocyte count <1500/uL; Platelet count
             <75,000/uL; Hemoglobin <8.5 g/dL (hemoglobin may be supported by transfusion or
             erythropoietin or other approved hematopoietic growth factors; darbopoeitin
             [Aranesp(R)] is permitted); Serum bilirubin >2.0 x upper limits of normal (ULN);
             Alkaline phosphatase, AST, and ALT >2.5 x ULN (AST, ALT >5 x ULN for subjects with
             liver metastasis); Serum creatinine >2.0; International normalized ratio (INR) >1.5
             and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) >1.5 x ULN (except for subjects
             receiving anticoagulation therapy); Urine protein/creatinine ratio >1.0 at screening

          -  Blood pressure >150/100 mmHg

          -  Unstable angina

          -  New York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade II or greater congestive heart failure (see
             Appendix B). Women who have received prior Doxil(R) therapy and have an ejection
             fraction <50% will be excluded from the study.

          -  History of myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to Day 0 (the day of the first
             bevacizumab infusion)

          -  History of stroke or transient ischemic attack within 6 months prior to Day 0

          -  Clinically significant peripheral vascular disease

          -  Evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy

          -  Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days
             prior to Day 0; anticipation of need for major elective surgical procedure during the
             course of the study

          -  Minor surgical procedures, fine needle aspirations, or core biopsies within 7 days
             prior to Day 0

          -  History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intra-abdominal
             abscess within 6 months prior to Day 0

          -  Serious, non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture

          -  Presence of central nervous system or brain metastases

          -  History of other malignancies within 5 years of Day 0, except for adequately treated
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of breast, or basal

          -  Any other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical
             laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that
             contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that may affect the
             interpretation of the results or render the subject at high risk from treatment
             complications
