TITLE:
Estrogen Use in Protection From Cognitive Decline

CONDITION:
Aging

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      This study is designed to assess the effects of estrogen therapy among postmenopausal women
      at risk for cognitive decline.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      A total of 71 postmenopausal women ages 50-65 on estrogen therapy will be randomized to
      continue or discontinue use of estrogen and will be followed for two years.

      Participants will undergo PET and MRI scans and neuropsychological assessments initially and
      at the end of the two-year follow-up period. These procedures will allow us to evaluate
      brain metabolism and cognitive performance at baseline and two years following continuation
      or discontinuation of estrogen therapy.

      We hypothesize that women who discontinue estrogen will show more evidence of decline than
      those who continue estrogen. This project will expand current knowledge of effects of
      estrogen by 1) determining whether estrogen use among postmenopausal women at risk for
      cognitive decline is protective of brain metabolism, 2) identifying early predictors for
      cognitive decline, and 3) developing guidelines for estrogen use in postmenopausal women.
