TITLE:
Body-Oriented Therapy for Sexual Abuse Recovery

CONDITION:
Child Abuse, Sexual

INTERVENTION:
Body-Oriented Therapy

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to examine and compare the effects of two body therapy
      approaches in women who have experienced child sexual abuse.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Women who have experienced child sexual abuse often display symptoms of dissociation and
      lack of bodily self-awareness which hinder the recovery process. Mind-body researchers have
      examined alternative therapeutic approaches to eliminating these factors. This study will
      compare a standardized therapeutic message to body-oriented therapy which involves a
      combination of hands-on bodywork and verbal therapy focused on somatic and emotional
      awareness.
