TITLE:
The Effects of Smell on Mood and Physical Responses

CONDITION:
Stress

INTERVENTION:
Exposure to relaxant and stimulant odors

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to examine the body's response to relaxing and stimulating
      fragrances commonly used in aromatherapy.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Despite aromatherapy's popularity, efficacy data are scant, and potential mechanisms are
      controversial. This randomized controlled trial examined the psychological, autonomic,
      endocrine, and immune consequences of one purported relaxant odor (lavender), one stimulant
      odor (lemon), and a no-odor control (water), before and after a stressor (cold pressor); 56
      healthy men and women were exposed to each of the odors during three separate visits. To
      assess the effects of expectancies, participants randomized to the "blind" condition were
      given no information about the odors they would smell; "primed" individuals were told what
      odors they would smell during the session, and what changes to expect. Experimenters were
      blind.

      In each case we measured several different aspects of the cellular immune response, as well
      as skin barrier repair following tape stripping. This design allowed us to examine the
      ability of the odors to modulate endocrine and immune function, and health-relevant
      cutaneous responses.
