TITLE:
Study Measuring Differences in Cognition Due to Sedative Effects of Risperidone and Quetiapine in Stable Bipolar I Outpatients

CONDITION:
Bipolar Disorder

INTERVENTION:
risperidone; quetiapine

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the sedating (causing sleepiness) effects
      of risperidone or quetiapine alter cognitive (person's ability to think, perceive,
      recognize, remember, judge, and reason) functioning in subjects with stable Bipolar I
      Disorder.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      To compare the treatment effects of risperidone and quetiapine on cognitive function, using
      measures commonly believed to be affected by sedation and at doses typically used in
      clinical settings in stable bipolar I outpatients.One-half of patients are randomized to
      treatment sequence risperidone-quetiapine (R-Q), and the other one-half to
      quetiapine-risperidone (Q-R). Patients randomized to R-Q receive 2 mg of risperidone with
      dinner the night before testing and placebo with breakfast on the day of testing. After a 6
      - 14 day washout period they receive 100 mg quetiapine with dinner the night before their
      second day of testing and 100 mg with breakfast the day of testing.

      Those randomized to Q-R receive the same treatments, but in reverse order. Patients
      randomized to R-Q receive 2 mg of risperidone with dinner the night before testing and
      placebo with breakfast on the day of testing. After a 6-14 day washout period they receive
      100 mg quetiapine with dinner the night before their second day of testing and 100 mg with
      breakfast the day of testing. Those randomized to Q-R receive the same treatments, but in
      reverse order.
