TITLE:
Safety/Efficacy of Everolimus and Neoral in Adult Cardiac Transplant Patients With Established Allograft Vasculopathy

CONDITION:
Graft Rejection

INTERVENTION:
everolimus

SUMMARY:

      Everolimus is an immunosuppressive drug that is being studied for preventing acute rejection
      that can happen after heart transplantation.

      It is usually used in combination with other immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporine.
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the change in kidney function after beginning
      everolimus, while determining the most effective Neoral (cyclosporine) dose to take with
      everolimus, in adult cardiac transplant patients who have had their transplanted heart for
      at least 1 year and who have cardiac allograft vasculopathy.
