TITLE:
A Study of Thalidomide Plus Dexamethasone (Thal-Dex) Versus DOXIL plusThalidomide Plus Dexamethasone (DOXIL -Thal-Dex) in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma

CONDITION:
Multiple Myeloma

INTERVENTION:
Thalidomide

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to determine if Thalidomide + Dexamethasone or DOXIL
      (doxorubicin HCl liposome injection) + Thalidomide + Dexamethasone is more effective in
      treating newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma. The number of patients whose
      multiple myeloma disappears for a period of time (complete Response) will be studied to make
      the determination of which treatment is more effective.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      This is a multi-center, open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention),
      randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance) study to compare the safety and
      effectiveness of Thalidomide + Dexamethasone versus DOXIL (doxorubicin HCl liposome
      injection) + Thalidomide + Dexamethasone in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.
      Treatments are administered in 28-day cycles. Patients will receive 4 to 12 treatment
      cycles, depending on the response of their multiple myeloma to the treatment (measured
      according to the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplant Response Criteria). Patients
      will have additional tests that include Multiple Gated Acquisition (MUGA) scans or
      echocardiograms to assess the patients for potential cardiotoxicity that could be related to
      treatment with DOXIL (doxorubicin HCl liposome injection). Maximum duration of study
      participation for each participant will be 48 weeks.
