TITLE:
Safety and Efficacy of NovoLog vs. Humalog in Insulin Pumps in Children and Adolescents

CONDITION:
Diabetes

INTERVENTION:
insulin lispro

SUMMARY:

      This trial is conducted in the United States of America (USA). It is demonstrated that
      intensive insulin therapy resulting in good glycaemic control can reduce or delay the
      incidence of complications secondary to Type 1 Diabetes. Insulin Aspart (NovoLog) is an
      ideal insulin to use in an intensive insulin regimen using continuous subcutaneous insulin
      injection (CSII) therapy in the pediatric and adolescent age population. This trial compares
      the safety and efficacy of Insulin Aspart (NovoLog) and Insulin Lispro (Humalog) delivered
      by CSII in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.
