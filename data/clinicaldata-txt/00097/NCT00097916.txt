TITLE:
An Evaluation of the Safety and Efficacy of Memantine in Agitated Patients With Moderate to Severe Alzheimer's Disease

CONDITION:
Alzheimer's Disease

INTERVENTION:
memantine HCl

SUMMARY:

      About 65% of patients with severe Alzheimer's Disease (AD) will have symptoms of agitation.
      There are drawbacks associated with the currently available therapeutic interventions for
      agitation associated with Alzheimer's Disease. In a recent trial, in the group of patients
      with moderate to severe AD treated with memantine, there were fewer incidences of agitation.
      It is hypothesized that memantine will be effective in reducing the symptoms of agitation
      associated with moderate to severe Alzheimer's Disease.
