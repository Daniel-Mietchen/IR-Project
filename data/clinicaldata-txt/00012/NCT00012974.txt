TITLE:
Telephone Administered Psychotherapy for the Treatment of Depression for Veterans in Rural Areas

CONDITION:
Heart Failure

INTERVENTION:
GTelephone-administered Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (T-CBT)

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of telephone-administered
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (T-CBT) in treating major depression among veterans served by
      community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs) in the Veterans Integrated Service Network
      (VISN) 21, which serves rural areas in Northern California
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      More that 20% of patients in primary care have depressive disorders. While primary care is
      the principal venue for treatment for depression, fewer than 25% of depressed patients
      receive adequate treatment for their depression. These outcomes can be worse when there are
      barriers to treatment such as living in a rural area. Several studies have found that given
      a choice, about two-thirds of depressed primary care patients prefer psychotherapy or
      counseling over antidepressant medication.

      This is a controlled, randomized trial in which subjects meeting criteria for major
      depressive disorder (MDD) from primary care settings in VISN 21 including CBOCs will be
      randomly assigned to one of two conditions: 1) a 16-session manualized telephone
      administered cognitive behavioral therapy (T-CBT) delivered over 24 weeks or 2) a
      treatment-as-usual (TAU) condition. Telephone-administered cognitive behavioral therapy
      (T-CBT) is an intervention aimed at improving coping skills and social functioning. It is
      divided into two phases: 1) an initial treatment phase consisting of 12 weekly sessions
      aimed at reducing symptoms of depression, and 2) a booster phase in which 4 sessions are
      provided at increasingly greater intervals to target maintenance of treatment gains. T-CBT,
      administered by doctoral level psychologists, will be compared to a treatment-as-usual (TAU)
      condition that controls for the natural course of depression during the course of treatment.
