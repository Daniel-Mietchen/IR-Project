TITLE:
Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Cancer of the Gastrointestinal Tract

CONDITION:
Colorectal Cancer

INTERVENTION:
carcinoembryonic antigen peptide 1-6D

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of two different vaccines in
      treating patients who have cancer of the gastrointestinal tract.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine whether immunization with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) peptide 1-6D (CAP
           1-6D) emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 adjuvant or dissolved in sargramostim (GM-CSF) can
           generate CAP 1-6D-specific T cells in patients with CEA-producing adenocarcinomas of
           gastrointestinal tract origin.

        -  Determine whether vaccination with CAP 1-6D can generate cytotoxic T cells against
           CEA-expressing tumors in these patients.

        -  Determine whether this vaccine can produce antitumor responses in these patients.

        -  Determine the frequency and severity of toxic effects associated with this vaccine in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive carcinoembryonic antigen peptide 1-6D (CAP 1-6D) emulsified in
           Montanide ISA-51 adjuvant subcutaneously on day 1.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive CAP 1-6D dissolved in sargramostim (GM-CSF) intradermally on
           day 1.

      Treatment repeats in both arms every 3 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 3 weeks and then as necessary.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-36 patients (5-18 per arm) will be accrued for this study
      within 36 months.
