TITLE:
A Study Evaluating Tarceva in Combination With Avastin Versus Avastin Alone in Treating Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma

CONDITION:
Renal Cell Carcinoma

INTERVENTION:
Avastin (bevacizumab)

SUMMARY:

      The primary purpose of the study is to assess the potential benefit of combining two
      targeted therapies (an anti-EGF inhibitor along with an anti-VEGF inhibitor). The goal will
      be to determine whether the addition of Erlotinib to Avastin will improve the benefit in
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with regard to time to progression, response rate,
      duration of response, and survival compared with Avastin alone. Since Avastin has been shown
      to be active in renal cancer, the goal will be to assess whether this activity can be
      enhanced with Erlotinib.

          -  LDH >1.5 ULN

          -  Hemoglobin <9 gm/dL (may be transfused or receive epoetin alfa [e.g., Epogen] to
             maintain or exceed this level)

          -  History of serious systemic disease, including myocardial infarction within the last
             6 months, uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure >160/110 mmHg on medication),
             unstable angina, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade II or greater congestive
             heart failure, unstable symptomatic arrhythmia requiring medication (subjects with
             chronic atrial arrhythmia, i.e., atrial fibrillation or paroxysmal supraventricular
             tachycardia, are eligible), or Grade II or greater peripheral vascular disease

          -  History of acute stroke within 6 months prior to randomization

          -  Patients on dialysis

          -  Other invasive malignancies, including bladder cancer and low-grade endometrial
             cancer, within 5 years of randomization (other than squamous or basal cell carcinoma
             of the skin)

          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding

          -  Inability to comply with study and/or follow-up procedures

          -  History of other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or
             clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition
             that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that might affect the
             interpretation of the results of the study or render the subject at high risk from
             treatment complications

          -  Serious, non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture

          -  Evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy

          -  History or clinical evidence of central nervous system or brain metastases

             course of the study

               -  Fine needle aspirations or core biopsies within 7 days prior to Day 0
