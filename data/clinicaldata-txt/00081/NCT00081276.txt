TITLE:
3-AP and Cisplatin in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Persistent Platinum-Resistant Ovarian Epithelial or Primary Peritoneal Cancer

CONDITION:
Primary Peritoneal Cavity Cancer

INTERVENTION:
triapine

SUMMARY:

      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as 3-AP and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop tumor
      cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more
      tumor cells. This phase II trial is studying how well giving 3-AP together with cisplatin
      works in treating patients with recurrent or persistent platinum-resistant ovarian
      epithelial cancer or primary peritoneal cancer
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the antitumor activity of 3-AP and cisplatin in patients with recurrent or
      persistent platinum-resistant ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer.

      II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the duration of progression-free survival and overall survival in patients
      treated with this regimen.

      II. Determine the effects of prognostic variables, including initial performance status,
      age, and mucinous (or clear cell) histology, in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized study.

      Patients receive 3-AP IV over 2 hours on days 1-4 and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 2 and
      3. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients are followed for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 23-48 patients will be accrued for this study within 13
      months.
