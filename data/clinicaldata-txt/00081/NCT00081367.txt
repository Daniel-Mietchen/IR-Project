TITLE:
Community-Based Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Attempters

CONDITION:
Suicide, Attempted

INTERVENTION:
CBT

SUMMARY:

      This study will determine the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in
      preventing future suicide attempts in repeat suicide attempters.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Rates of mental health and substance use disorders are high among economically
      disadvantaged, ethnic minority populations. Studies have shown that CBT designed for this
      high-risk population is successful at reducing suicide attempts in people with suicidal
      thoughts or attempts. This study will implement a CBT intervention into the community and
      will focus on increasing compliance with psychiatric, substance abuse, and medical
      treatment.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive either CBT plus standard
      care or standard care alone. Participants who receive CBT will have ten weekly sessions of
      treatment. Suicidal thoughts or attempts, hopelessness, depression, health care utilization,
      and overall psychological and social adaptation will be assessed. Assessments will be made
      1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after study completion.
