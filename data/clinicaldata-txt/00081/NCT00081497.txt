TITLE:
A Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Fabrazyme in Patients With Fabry Disease

CONDITION:
Fabry Disease

INTERVENTION:
agalsidase beta

SUMMARY:

      People with Fabry Disease have an alteration in their genetic material (DNA) which causes a
      deficiency of the alpha-galactosidase A enzyme. Fabrazyme (agalsidase beta) is a drug that
      helps to break down and removes certain types of fatty substances called "glycolipids".
      These glycolipids are normally present within the body in most cells. In Fabry disease,
      glycolipids build up in various tissues such as the liver, kidney, skin, and blood vessels
      because a-galactosidase A is not present, or is present in small quantities. The build up of
      glycolipid (globatriaosylceramide or GL-3) levels in these tissues in particular is thought
      to cause the clinical symptoms that are common to Fabry disease. This study analyzed the
      safety and efficacy of Fabrazyme in the treatment of patients with Fabry disease that
      previously participated in the AGAL-008-00 (NCT0074984) study.
