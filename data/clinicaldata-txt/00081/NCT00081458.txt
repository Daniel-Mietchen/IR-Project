TITLE:
Safety and Efficacy Study of Teduglutide in Subjects With Short Bowel Syndrome

CONDITION:
Short Bowel Syndrome

INTERVENTION:
Placebo

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of teduglutide compared with placebo in subjects with parenteral
      nutrition (PN)-dependent short bowel syndrome (SBS).
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Teduglutide is an analog of glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2), a naturally occurring hormone
      that regulates the growth, proliferation, and maintenance of cells lining the
      gastrointestinal tract. Teduglutide has been shown in animal studies and previous human
      clinical trials to increase the size and number of these cells, thereby increasing the
      absorptive surface area of the intestines.

      The multicenter, double-blind, international Phase III trial will randomly assign
      approximately 80 patients to receive daily subcutaneous injections of 0.05 milligrams or
      0.10 milligrams of teduglutide per kilogram of body weight, or a placebo. Dosing will
      continue for a period of six months. The primary endpoint in the study is a reduction in the
      use of intravenous feeding, which is often required to sustain life in patients with SBS.

             consent form (ICF)

          -  SBS as a result of major intestinal resection resulting in at least 12 months
             intravenous feeding

          -  Body weight must be less than 90 kg

          -  At baseline, subjects must require PN treatment to meet their caloric or electrolyte
             needs due to ongoing malabsorption at least 3 times weekly and to be on a stable PN
             regimen for 4 weeks before dosing

          -  Body mass index (BMI) 18 to 27 kg/m2

          -  Adequate hepatic and renal function

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of cancer or clinically significant lymphoproliferative disease with fewer
             than 5 years documented disease-free state

          -  History of alcohol or drug abuse (within previous year)

          -  Participation in a clinical study within 30 days prior to signing the ICF, or
             concurrent participation in any clinical study

          -  Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities at the time of randomization

          -  Previous use of teduglutide (ALX-0600)

          -  Prior use of native GLP-2 within 3 months of screening visit

          -  Hospital admission within 1 month prior to screening visit

          -  Pregnant or lactating women

          -  Any condition or circumstance, which in the investigator's opinion would put the
             subject at any undue risk, prevent completion of the study, or interfere with
             analysis of the study results.

          -  Presence of excluded disease: Radiation enteritis, Scleroderma, Celiac disease,
             Refractory/Tropical sprue, Pseudo-obstruction, Active inflammatory bowel disease
             (IBD), Pre-malignant/malignant change in colonoscopy biopsy or polypectomy, Surgery
