TITLE:
Cognition, Steroids, and Imaging in Cushings Disease

CONDITION:
Cushing Syndrome

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      This study investigates the effects of the glucocorticoid hormone cortisol on brain
      structure and function. Patients with Cushing's disease are studied before and after
      treatment. Brain imaging and neuropsychologic tests are used to study changes in the
      hippocampus and thinking and learning functions as well as mood during the period of
      elevated cortisol. At several intervals after treatment, these are reexamined to study the
      degree of reversibility of the abnormalities. The contribution of cortisol as well as
      testosterone and estrogen to dysfunction and recovery is studied. Since elevated cortisol
      and dysregulation of its secretory system occurs in a significant proportion of the aged and
      in Alzheimers Disease and Major Depressive Disorder, these studies will help advance
      knowledge of the role of cortisol in these conditions.
