TITLE:
Immunotoxin Therapy in Treating Patients With Hairy Cell Leukemia

CONDITION:
Leukemia

INTERVENTION:
BL22 immunotoxin

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: An immunotoxin can locate cancer cells and kill them without harming normal
      cells. This may be an effective treatment for hairy cell leukemia.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of BL22 immunotoxin in treating patients
      who have refractory or recurrent hairy cell leukemia.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Assess the toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of recombinant BL22 immunotoxin in
           patients with refractory or recurrent CD22+ hairy cell leukemia.

        -  Define the pharmacokinetics of this drug, including the terminal elimination serum
           half-life area under the curve and volume of distribution, in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the immunogenicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the effect of this drug on various components of the circulating cellular
           immune system in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive recombinant BL22 immunotoxin IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5.
      Treatment repeats at least every 42 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression and sufficient neutralizing antibodies.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of recombinant BL22 immunotoxin until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which no more
      than 1 of 6 patients experiences dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 46 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
