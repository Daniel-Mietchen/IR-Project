SUMMARY:

      This non-randomized study will test the safety and effectiveness of Genasense in patients
      with CLL.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      This study is a two-part phase I-II study. Part 1 will determine the MTD of Genasense in
      patients with CLL. This dose will then be tested in a non-randomized, multi-center, Phase II
      sequential clinical trial of Genasense used alone for treatment of patients with advanced
      CLL.

      Pharmacokinetics of Genasense and kinetics of Bcl-2 down regulation and re-expression in CLL
      cells will be followed in selected patients.
