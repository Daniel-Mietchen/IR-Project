TITLE:
Compassionate Use of Campath-1H in Treating Patients With Refractory Prolymphocytic Leukemia or Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia

CONDITION:
Leukemia

INTERVENTION:
alemtuzumab

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver
      cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Compassionate use refers to
      providing a drug to a patient on humanitarian grounds before the drug has received official
      approval.

      PURPOSE: Compassionate use of Campath-1H in treating patients who have refractory
      prolymphocytic leukemia or chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Expand access to Campath-1H for patients with refractory prolymphocytic
      leukemia or chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive Campath-1H IV over 2 hours on days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment repeats
      weekly for 4-12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
