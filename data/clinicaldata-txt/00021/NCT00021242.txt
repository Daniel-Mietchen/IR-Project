TITLE:
Docetaxel in Treating Children With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic or Acute Myeloid Leukemia

CONDITION:
Leukemia

INTERVENTION:
docetaxel

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop
      cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of docetaxel in treating children who
      have relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic or acute myeloid leukemia.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the response rate in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory acute
           lymphoblastic or acute myeloid leukemia treated with docetaxel.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for a maximum of 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-20 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
