TITLE:
Phase II/III Study of Anti-VEGF in Neovascular AMD

CONDITION:
Macular Degeneration

INTERVENTION:
EYE001 anti-VEGF aptamer

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of the study is to determine whether the anti-VEGF drug is effective at
      stabilizing and/or improving vision in patients with the wet form of AMD
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      This will be a randomized, double-masked, controlled, dose-ranging, multi-center comparative
      trial, in parallel groups. Patients will be stratified by clinical center, by percentage of
      classic CNV vessels: [predominantly classic (>50%) vs. minimally classic (1-49%) vs. purely
      occult (0%)], and according to whether, or not, they have received prior PDT with Visudyne
      (no more than once). All patients will be re-randomized after 54 weeks of treatment to
      either, continue or discontinue therapy for further 48 weeks.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 50 Years to N/A
Criteria:

        Patients of either gender, aged 50 years or above, diagnosed with subfoveal CNV secondary
        to AMD and with best corrected visual acuity of 20/40 to 20/320 in the absence of
        subfoveal atrophy or scarring in the study eye, and better or equal to 20/800 in the
        fellow eye, may be enrolled. Clinically significant concomitant diseases will be excluded.
