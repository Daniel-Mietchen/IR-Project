TITLE:
KALETRA Or LEXIVA With Ritonavir Combined With EPIVIR And Abacavir In Naive Subjects Over 48 Weeks

CONDITION:
HIV Infection

INTERVENTION:
LEXIVA (GW433908)

SUMMARY:

      This study will compare the ability of fosamprenavir 700 mg with ritonavir 100 mg twice a
      day or lopinavir 400 mg with ritonavir 100 mg twice a day both combined with a fixed dose
      combination tablet of abacavir 600 mg and lamivudine 300 mg once a day to suppress virus
      levels of HIV to less than 400 copies/mL of blood. In addition we will study the safety and
      tolerability of these compounds over the 48 week study period in patients naive to anti-HIV
      therapy.
