TITLE:
Effects of Arzoxifene on Bone Mass and the Uterus

CONDITION:
Postmenopausal Bone Loss

INTERVENTION:
Arzoxifene

SUMMARY:

      The purposes of this study are to determine:

        -  The effects of arzoxifene on bone mineral density (bone mass) at the spine and hip in
           postmenopausal women.

        -  The effects of arzoxifene on the uterus (womb) in postmenopausal women.

        -  The effects of arzoxifene on blood tests that measure changes in bone rebuilding in
           postmenopausal women with low bone density.

        -  The effects of arzoxifene on blood lipids (fats) and other blood markers of heart
           disease risk.

        -  The safety of arzoxifene and any side effects that might be associated with its use.
