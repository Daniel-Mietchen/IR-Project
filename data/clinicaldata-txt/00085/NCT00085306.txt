TITLE:
Interferon Beta in Treating Patients With Metastatic Cutaneous Melanoma or Ocular Melanoma

CONDITION:
Stage IV Melanoma

INTERVENTION:
recombinant interferon beta

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Interferon beta may interfere with the growth of tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well interferon beta works in treating patients
      with metastatic cutaneous (skin) melanoma or ocular (eye) melanoma.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the objective clinical response rate in patients with metastatic cutaneous or
           ocular melanoma treated with interferon beta.

        -  Determine the frequency and degree of apoptosis induction in patients treated with this
           drug.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients are stratified according to type of melanoma
      (ocular vs cutaneous).

      Patients receive interferon beta subcutaneously once daily in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed within 3 days after completion of study treatment and then for
      survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28-56 patients (14-28 per stratum) will be accrued for this
      study.
