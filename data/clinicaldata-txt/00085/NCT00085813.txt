TITLE:
Ispinesib In Patients With Advanced Or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer

CONDITION:
Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer

INTERVENTION:
Ispinesib

SUMMARY:

      This study was designed to determine how effective and safe Ispinesib is in treating locally
      advanced or metastatic Non-small Cell Lung cancer in patients who have received a
      platinum-based chemotherapy and whose disease continues to progress. Treatment involves a
      1-hr treatment given intravenously (IV), repeated once every 21 days. A patient may continue
      treatment as long as they are benefiting from the treatment. Blood samples will be taken at
      specific times over 24 hr period to measure the amount of drug in your body at specific
      times after the drug is given. Blood samples will also be taken for routine lab tests such
      as complete blood counts and clinical chemistries. Physical exams will be performed before
      each treatment.
