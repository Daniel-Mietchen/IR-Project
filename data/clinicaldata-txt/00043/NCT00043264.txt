TITLE:
Antibiotic Treatment Trial Directed Against Chlamydia Pneumonia in Multiple Sclerosis

CONDITION:
Multiple Sclerosis

INTERVENTION:
Rifampin

SUMMARY:

      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory, demyelinating disease which affects the central
      nervous system (CNS). The etiology of MS is unknown, although the immune system appears to
      play a role. Many different infectious agents have been proposed as potential causes for MS,
      including Epstein-Barr virus, human herpesvirus 6, and coronaviruses. Recently Dr. Sriram at
      Vanderbilt University has found evidence for active Chlamydia pneumonia infection in the CNS
      of MS patients. These findings have been replicated in part by other laboratories.

      The purpose of the current study is to test whether antibiotic treatment aimed at
      eradicating Chlamydia infection will reduce the disease activity in MS. The primary outcome
      measure will be reduction in new enhancing MS lesions on brain MRI. Forty patients will be
      entered into the trial. To be eligible, patients must have evidence of chlamydia infection
      in their spinal fluid and enhancing lesions on their pre-randomization MRI scans. Patients
      who meet these criteria will be randomized to either placebo or antibiotic therapy, and
      followed for 6 months on treatment.
