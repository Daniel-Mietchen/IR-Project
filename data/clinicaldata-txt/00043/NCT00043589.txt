TITLE:
Memory and Mental Health in Aging

CONDITION:
Memory Disorders

INTERVENTION:
donepezil

SUMMARY:

      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of donepezil (Aricept) and cognitive training in
      improving memory performance in elderly adults.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      The drug donepezil plus cognitive training may work better than cognitive training alone to
      improve the memory of nondemented older adults. In this study, participants are assigned
      randomly to receive either donepezil plus cognitive training or placebo plus cognitive
      training. Memory and quality of life tests are used to evaluate the effects of the study
      treatments.
