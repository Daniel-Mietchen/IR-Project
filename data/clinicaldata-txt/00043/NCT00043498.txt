TITLE:
Health Effects of Early-Life Exposure to Urban Pollutants in Minority Children

CONDITION:
Asthma

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      A molecular epidemiologic study of African American and Hispanic mothers and newborns to
      investigate the role of common urban pollutants on procarcinogenic and developmental damage.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      The major objective of the proposed research is to study the impact of early-life exposures
      to common urban pollutants on neurobehavioral development and asthma in a sample of children
      living in three low-income, minority communities of New York City (Central Harlem,
      Washington Heights and the South Bronx). Using a molecular epidemiologic approach with
      monitoring, biomarkers, and clinical assessments at serial time points, we will extend our
      study of African-American and Latina urban mothers and children in order to follow the
      cohort through child age 11 years to assess the longer-term impact of exposures on child
      health and developmental outcomes.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: Female
Age: 18 Years to 35 Years
Criteria:

        Enrollment eligibility was restricted to nonsmoking pregnant women 18-35 years of age who
        self-identified as either African American or Dominican and who had resided in northern
        Manhattan or the South Bronx in New York City for at least 1 year before pregnancy. Women
        were excluded if they used illicit drugs, had diabetes, hypertension, or known HIV, or had
        their first prenatal visit after the 20th week of pregnancy.
