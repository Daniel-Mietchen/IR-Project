TITLE:
SYNERGY: Open Study of Enoxaparin Versus Unfractionated Heparin in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndromes

CONDITION:
Unstable Angina

INTERVENTION:
enoxaparin

SUMMARY:

      Patients experiencing a mild heart attack will receive one of two medications which thin the
      blood to discern which is superior.

Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Male or nonpregnant female greater than or equal to 18 years old

          -  Ischemic pain originating or persisting at rest, or its clinical equivalent, lasting
             greater than or equal to 10 minutes and occurring within the 24 hours before
             enrollment

          -  At least 2 of the following:

               -  ECG changes: New or presumably new ST-segment depression greater than or equal
                  to 0.1 mV (greater than or equal to 1 mm), or transient (<30 minutes) ST-segment
                  elevation greater than or equal to 0.1 mV (greater than or equal to 1 mm) in at
                  least 2 contiguous leads

               -  Abnormal cardiac enzymes within the 24 hours before enrollment, defined as
                  elevated troponin I or T greater than the established criteria at each site OR
                  creatine kinase CK-MB level greater than the site's upper limit of normal

               -  Age greater than or equal to 60 years

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known or suspected pregnancy

          -  Increased bleeding risk: ischemic stroke within the last year or any previous
             hemorrhagic stroke, tumor, or intracranial aneurysm; recent (<1 month) trauma or
             major surgery (including bypass surgery); active bleeding

          -  Impaired hemostasis: known International Normalized Ratio (INR) >1.5; past or present
             bleeding disorder (including congenital bleeding disorders such as von Willebrand's
             disease or hemophilia, acquired bleeding disorders, and unexplained clinically
             significant bleeding disorders), thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100,000/mL), or
             history of thrombocytopenia with GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor therapy, heparin, or
             enoxaparin

          -  Angina from a secondary cause such as severe, uncontrolled hypertension (systolic
             blood pressure >180 mm Hg despite treatment); anemia; valvular disease; congenital
             heart disease; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; restrictive or constrictive
             cardiomyopathy; thyrotoxicosis

          -  PCI within the past 24 hours, not including coronary angiography only

          -  Allergy to pork or pork products

          -  Contraindications to UFH or LMWH

          -  Recent (<48 hours) or planned spinal/epidural anesthesia or puncture

          -  Thrombolytic therapy within the preceding 24 hours

          -  Other serious diseases, including severe liver disease or renal failure [creatinine
             clearance <30 mL/min

          -  Treatment with other investigational agents or devices within the previous 30 days,
             planned use of investigational drugs or devices, or previous enrollment in this trial

          -  Inability to give informed consent or high likelihood of being unavailable for
             follow-up

          -  Not a candidate for intervention, (angiography or PCI)

          -  Treatment with a direct thrombin inhibitor or a low molecular weight heparin other
             than enoxaparin in the 7 days preceding enrollment.
