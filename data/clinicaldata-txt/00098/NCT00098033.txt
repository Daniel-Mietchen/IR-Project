TITLE:
Investigation of Clofarabine in Acute Leukemias

CONDITION:
Acute Myelogenous Leukemia

INTERVENTION:
clofarabine

SUMMARY:

      The goals and objectives of this project are to evaluate the antileukemic activity of the
      investigational agent clofarabine in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), acute
      lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in accelerated and
      blastic phases.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      The specific aims of the project are (1) conduct the phase II study of clofarabine and
      evaluate the antileukemic efficacy in AML, ALL, and CML-accelerated and blastic phases in
      terms of complete response (CR) rate, response duration, and survival; and (2) analyze the
      relationship between cellular uptake and retention of clofarabine triphosphate (the active
      metabolite), inhibition of DNA synthesis, and clinical outcome.

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 12 Years to N/A
Criteria:

        -  Patient is diagnosed with AML, ALL, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and CML in
             transformation (includes CML-blastic phase and CML-accelerated phase).

          -  No prior chemo-, immuno-, or radio-therapy for 2 weeks before entering the study,
             unless progressive life-threatening leukemia as judged by the treated physician.

          -  Adequate liver function (bilirubin </= 2 mg%) and renal function (creatinine </= 2
             mg%).

          -  Pregnant and lactating females not eligible.

          -  Zubrod performance status 0-2

          -  Adequate cardiac status

          -  No life-threatening conditions (e.g. infections) which may cause death within 3
             weeks.
