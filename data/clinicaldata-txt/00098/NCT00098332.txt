TITLE:
Forodesine (BCX-1777) in Treating Patients With Refractory Stage IIA, Stage IIB, Stage III, Stage IVA, or Stage IVB Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma

CONDITION:
Lymphoma

INTERVENTION:
forodesine hydrochloride

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Forodesine (BCX-1777) may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the enzymes
      necessary for their growth.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of BCX-1777 in treating patients who have
      refractory stage IIA, stage IIB, stage III, stage IVA, or stage IVB cutaneous T-cell
      lymphoma.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety and efficacy of forodesine (BCX-1777) in patients with refractory
           stage IIA-IVB cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral forodesine (BCX-1777) once daily on days 1-28. Courses may be repeated
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Not specified.
