TITLE:
Thalidomide and Temozolomide in Relapsed or Progressive CNS Disease or Neuroblastoma

CONDITION:
Central Nervous System Tumor, Pediatric

INTERVENTION:
temozolomide

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Thalidomide may stop the growth of tumor cells by stopping blood flow to the
      tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop
      tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining thalidomide with
      temozolomide may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the effectiveness of combining thalidomide with
      temozolomide in treating young patients who have relapsed or progressive brain tumors or
      recurrent neuroblastoma.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the feasibility of thalidomide and temozolomide in pediatric patients with
           relapsed or progressive poor prognosis brain tumors or recurrent neuroblastomas.

      Secondary

        -  Determine preliminarily evidence of biologic activity of this regimen in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      STATISTICAL DESIGN: The primary data analysis will estimate the percentage of patients who
      can complete 6 months of therapy in the mixed population. With a target accrual of 20
      patients the 90% confidence for the true feasibility rate will be no wider than 40%.
