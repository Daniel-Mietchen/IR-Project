TITLE:
Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients Who Are Undergoing Surgery for Stage IB, Stage II, or Stage IIIA Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer

CONDITION:
Lung Cancer

INTERVENTION:
autologous tumor cell vaccine

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a person's tumor cells and white blood cells may make the body
      build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vaccine therapy in
      treating patients who are undergoing surgery for stage IB, stage II, or stage IIIA non-small
      cell lung cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of adjuvant autologous dendritic cells loaded with
           irradiated autologous tumor cells in patients with stage IB-IIIA non-small cell lung
           cancer undergoing resection.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this vaccine in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the feasibility of this vaccine in these patients.

        -  Determine vaccine-specific and antitumor immunity in patients treated with this
           vaccine.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients undergo leukaphersis to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). PBMC are
      expanded ex vivo to generate monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DC). Autologous tumor cells
      are harvested and purified at the time of surgical resection. DC are then loaded with
      irradiated autologous tumor cells.

      Within 4-8 weeks after surgical resection, patients receive autologous DC loaded with
      irradiated autologous tumor cells intradermally on approximately days 1, 30, and 60 in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 6-9 patients receive escalating doses of vaccine until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. If 2 of 9 patients in the first cohort experience dose-limiting
      toxicity, that dose level is considered the MTD.

      Patients are followed at approximately 1 and 4 months, and then every 6 months for 4 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-15 patients will be accrued for this study within 18
      months.
