TITLE:
Study of Oral Zileuton in the Treatment of Moderate to Severe Facial Acne Vulgaris

CONDITION:
Acne Vulgaris

INTERVENTION:
Zileuton

SUMMARY:

      Tissue inflammation is a major component of the acne disease process. Leukotriene B4 (LTB4)
      is thought to be a major player in the development of tissue inflammation. Synthesis of LTB4
      is controlled by the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase. Zileuton blocks the activity of 5-lipoxygenase.
      This study will test the safety and efficacy of zileuton in the treatment of facial acne.
