TITLE:
A Humanized Anti-Interferon- Monoclonal Antibody (HuZAF) for Moderate to Severe Crohn's Disease

CONDITION:
Crohn's Disease

INTERVENTION:
anti-Interferon-gamma monoclonal antibody

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of the HARMONY study is to assess the safety and efficacy of an investigational
      drug called HuZAF, in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD). HuZAF is a
      humanized anti-Interferon-gamma (anti-IFN-) monoclonal antibody, which binds and blocks
      IFN-, a protein in the immune system that is involved in inflammation. Antibodies are
      proteins normally produced by our immune system to help fight off foreign substances.
      Scientists have been able to make therapeutic humanized monoclonal antibodies, similar to
      the antibodies in our bodies, to target diseases.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Participants will be randomized, assigned by chance, to one of five treatment groups
      consisting of: four groups differing in the amount of study drug given and one placebo
      group. The initial dose of study drug will be given intravenously, injected into a vein in
      the arm. Four weeks later, three subsequent doses of study drug will be given
      subcutaneously, through the skin, every four weeks for three doses. Patients will be
      followed for approximately six months after receiving their final dose.
