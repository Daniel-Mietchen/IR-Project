TITLE:
S0212 Celecoxib in Treating Patients With High-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions of the Cervix

CONDITION:
Stage 0 Cervical Cancer

INTERVENTION:
celecoxib

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the
      development of cancer. Celecoxib may be effective in preventing cervical cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of celecoxib in preventing
      cervical cancer in patients who have high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions of the
      cervix.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the complete response rate in patients with high-grade squamous intraepithelial
           lesions of the cervix treated with celecoxib vs placebo.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these drugs in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the effect of celecoxib on cyclooxygenase-2 expression and
           human papilloma virus expression in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion status (cervical
      intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN] 2 vs CIN 3). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily for 1 month.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily for 1 month. In both arms, treatment
           repeats monthly for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity. All patients then undergo loop electrosurgical excision procedure or cone
           biopsy to determine response.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients (50 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 1-2 years.
