TITLE:
Surgical Resection With or Without Axillary Lymph Node Dissection in Treating Women With Node-Negative Breast Cancer and Sentinel Lymph Node Micrometastases

CONDITION:
Breast Cancer

INTERVENTION:
Axillary lymph node dissection

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Surgery to remove lymph nodes in the armpit in patients with sentinel lymph node
      micrometastases may remove cancer cells that have spread from tumors in the breast. It is
      not yet known whether surgery to remove the primary tumor is more effective with or without
      axillary lymph node dissection.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying surgery and axillary lymph node
      dissection to see how well they work compared to surgery alone in treating women with
      node-negative breast cancer and sentinel lymph node micrometastases.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare disease-free survival of women with clinically node-negative breast cancer with
           sentinel lymph node micrometastases treated with surgical resection with or without
           axillary dissection.

        -  Compare overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Assess sites of recurrence, particularly reappearance of disease in the undissected
           axilla.

        -  Assess long-term surgical complications in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to participating
      center, menopausal status (pre- vs postmenopausal), and preoperative sentinel node biopsy
      (yes vs no). Patients are followed every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 4 years,
      and then annually thereafter.
