TITLE:
Study Evaluating EKB-569 in Advanced Colorectal Cancer

CONDITION:
Colorectal Neoplasms

INTERVENTION:
EKB-569

SUMMARY:

      This non-randomized, open-label, outpatient clinical trial is designed to assess the safety
      and efficacy of daily orally administered EKB-569 in subjects with advanced colorectal
      cancer. Patients must have been previously treated with a fluoropyrimidine (5-FU or
      capecitabine) and either oxaliplatin or irinotecan (given concurrently or as separate
      regimens).

      The primary objective of the study is to assess the clinical activity of EKB-569
      administered orally as a second-line or later stage treatment in subjects with advanced
      colorectal cancer.

      Secondary objectives include:

        -  To further evaluate the safety of EKB-569

        -  To explore additional clinical activity parameters

        -  To explore subject survival

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of EKB-569

        -  To assess subject reported outcomes

      EKB-569 will be administered orally as a single-agent. Eligible subjects will take EKB-569
      daily as long as they do not have progressive disease and are tolerating treatment.
