TITLE:
Diabetes Therapy to Improve BMI and Lung Function in CF

CONDITION:
Cystic Fibrosis

INTERVENTION:
Insulin Asparte

SUMMARY:

      To recruit 150 adult patients with cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) without fasting
      hyperglycemia for a multi-center, twelve month, placebo-controlled intervention trial
      testing the ability of insulin or repaglinide to improve body mass index (BMI) and stabilize
      pulmonary function in cystic fibrosis (CF).
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      The primary objective of this research is to determine whether treatment with either insulin
      or an oral diabetes agent that increases endogenous insulin secretion will improve BMI and
      pulmonary function in cystic fibrosis patients who have diabetes without fasting
      hyperglycemia.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 16 Years to N/A
Criteria:

        -  Diabetic glucose pattern by oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) of >200 at 120 min.
             (stable and healthy at time of OGTT)

          -  Fasting glucose levels <126.

          -  Weight stable within 5% in previous 3 months.

          -  Free from illness for two months.

          -  Male and female 16 and older, who are done growing

          -  Willing to come in for visits every 3 months.

          -  Patients receiving infrequent short bursts of systemic glucocorticoids may be
             considered for the study inclusion if: a. they have not received systemic
             glucocorticoids steroids for at least one month, b. they did not receive the steroids
             for more than 14 consecutive days or 28 days total in six months
