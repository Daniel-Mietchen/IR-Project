TITLE:
Study of Irinotecan and Cetuximab Versus Irinotecan as Second-Line Treatment in Patients With Metastatic, EGFR-Positive Colorectal Cancer

CONDITION:
Colorectal Cancer

INTERVENTION:
cetuximab

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether overall survival is prolonged in subjects
      with metastatic, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-positive colorectal cancer treated
      with cetuximab in combination with irinotecan compared with irinotecan alone as second-line
      therapy following treatment with a fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin based,
      non-irinotecan-containing regimen.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
NONE

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 18 Years to N/A
Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically documented colorectal cancer which is EGFR-positive by
             immunohistochemistry [IHC] (may be based on archival samples) and is metastatic.

          -  Prior oxaliplatin administered for the first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal
             cancer.

          -  Prior fluoropyrimidine-containing regimen (5-fluorouracil [5-FU], capecitabine, or
             uracil/tegafur [UFT]), for the first-line treatment of metastatic disease.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A serious uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             would impair the ability of the subject to receive protocol therapy

          -  Unresolved diarrhea, bowel obstruction, or history of inflammatory bowel disease

          -  Known or documented brain metastases
