TITLE:
Combination Therapy for the Treatment of Bipolar Disorders

CONDITION:
Bipolar Disorder

INTERVENTION:
Lithium

SUMMARY:

      This study will compare triple and double drug regimens in the treatment of patients with
      depression, hypomania, or mania.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Early studies have shown lithium to produce a high percentage of satisfactory clinical
      response in patients with bipolar disorders. These studies, however, do not include
      lithium-refractory subgroups, such as bipolar II disorder patients. When the wide spectrum
      of bipolar disorders is considered, the lithium response rate decreases significantly. More
      broadly effective regimens are needed.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive either lithium plus
      divalproex or lithium, divalproex, and lamotrigine for 7 months. Symptoms of depression and
      mania will be assessed with scales and patient questionnaires.
