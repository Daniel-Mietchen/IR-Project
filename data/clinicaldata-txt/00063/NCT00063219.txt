TITLE:
Study Evaluating MAC-321 in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Refractory to Platinum-based Therapy

CONDITION:
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung

INTERVENTION:
MAC-321

SUMMARY:

      This non-randomized, open-label clinical trial is designed to determine safety and clinical
      activity of a new chemotherapeutic agent, MAC-321, when given intravenously to patients with
      non-small cell lung cancer. Clinical activity will be evaluated by determining the
      percentage of patients with an objective tumor response after treatment with MAC-321.
      Patients must have been previously treated with a platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen.

      A total of 96 patients will be enrolled in this trial. Eligible patients will receive
      MAC-321 intravenously every 3 weeks for up to a total of 6 courses of treatment. All
      patients will receive MAC-321 at the same dose. MAC-321 is an experimental drug, and is not
      offered outside of this research trial.
