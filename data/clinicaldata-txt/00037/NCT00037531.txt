TITLE:
Study Evaluating Sirolimus (Rapamune) in Solid Organ Transplant Recipients

CONDITION:
Graft vs Host Disease

INTERVENTION:
Sirolimus (RAPAMUNE)

SUMMARY:

      To evaluate the safety of long-term administration of sirolimus oral solution for up to 5
      additional years, or until the tablet formulation is commercially available (whichever
      occurs first) in solid organ transplant recipients who are currently receiving sirolimus and
      who have completed clinical trials with sirolimus (with or without cyclosporine (CsA). To
      evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of long-term administration of sirolimus tablets
      administered for up to 5 years, or until the tablet formulation is commercially available in
