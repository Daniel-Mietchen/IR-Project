TITLE:
Study Evaluating rFIX; BeneFIX in Severe Hemophilia B

CONDITION:
Hemophilia B

INTERVENTION:
BeneFIX

SUMMARY:

      To characterize the safety and efficacy of rFIX in children less than 6 years of age with
      severe hemophilia B in the setting of acute bleeding episodes, prophylaxis, and/or surgery.

      This study will provide an opportunity for systematic observation of treatment with rFIX in
      children less than 6 years of age regardless of prior FIX treatment. Younger patients
      exhibit a different pharmacokinetic profile and therefore may respond differently to rFIX
      infusions when compared with older children and adults. This evaluation will provide data
      from which recommendations can be made regarding rFIX dosing and treatment of these
      patients. Surveillance for certain observations that have been made in patients treated with
      rFIX in the clinical and postmarketing setting will be performed, including inhibitor
      development, thrombogenicity, FIX recovery/lack of effect, allergic-type manifestations, and
      RBC agglutination. Comparisons will be derived from published reports and communications
      describing experience with other FIX products and protein therapeutics in general.
