TITLE:
Robotic Upper-Limb Neurorehabilitation in Chronic Stroke Patient

CONDITION:
Stroke

INTERVENTION:
Upper extremity robot

SUMMARY:

      We have established the feasibility and effectiveness of robot-aided rehabilitation in
      stroke patients using a robot for neurological rehabilitation designed and built by MIT.
      Results of a pilot study of 20 patients were promising and showed that robot therapy is
      safe, tolerated by patients and produces a significant, measurable benefit. We propose to
      test that the robotic upper extremity trainer is an acceptable cost effective adjunct to
      standard occupational therapy for patients with dysfunction of the shoulder and elbow due to
      hemiparetic stroke in a VA rehabilitation program.
