TITLE:
Safety and Efficacy of Recombinant Adeno-Associated Virus Containing the CFTR Gene in the Treatment of Cystic Fibrosis

CONDITION:
Cystic Fibrosis

INTERVENTION:
tgAAVCF

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to confirm the improvement in pulmonary function and cytokine
      levels observed in the recently completed multidose aerosol study for the treatment of
      Cystic Fibrosis (CF).
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Cystic Fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder with an incidence of approximately 1 in
      33000 live births. It is due to defects in the CFTR gene, which is located on chromosome 7.
      Gene Therapy holds the promise of addressing the primary defect in CF by reconstituting the
      CFTR function in the lung. tgAAVCF, which has been genetically engineered to contain the
      CFTR gene, has been extremely well tolerated following single and multiple dose
      administrations to the nose, sinus, and lung. Dose-dependent gene transfer has been
      demonstrated. Although vector gene expression has not been detected, evidence consistent
      with biological activity was observed in maxillary sinus study, and statistically
      significant changes in the FEV1 and IL-8 levels were observed in the recently completed
      multidose aerosol study. These findings are worthy of further investigation.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 12 Years to N/A
Criteria:

        Eligible subjects will be randomized to two aerosolized doses of either tgAAVCF or placebo
        30 days apart. Subjects will undergo pulmonary function testing every two weeks during the
        active portion of the study (three months) and will be followed for safety for a total of
        seven months.
