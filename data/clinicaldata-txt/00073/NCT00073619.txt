TITLE:
Preventing Anxiety Disorders in Urban Youth

CONDITION:
Anxiety Disorders

INTERVENTION:
Cognitive-behavioral group therapy

SUMMARY:

      This study will determine the effectiveness of a cognitive-behavioral group therapy program
      in preventing anxiety disorders in at-risk children exposed to community violence.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Community violence is a major public health problem in low-income, urban communities. The
      mental health impact of living in a violent community is significant, particularly for
      children. Community violence exposure is associated with various symptoms of anxiety.
      Unfortunately, little research on the prevention of community-related anxiety in youth has
      been conducted. This study involves a school-based prevention and cognitive behavioral
      therapy program that will involve predominantly African American children who live in urban
      areas and are at risk for developing anxiety disorders.

      Children in this study will be randomly assigned to either an anxiety prevention and early
      intervention group or a nonintervention group for approximately 3 months. Child, parent, and
      teacher assessments of anxiety symptoms will be made at the end of the study and at a
      6-month follow-up visit.
