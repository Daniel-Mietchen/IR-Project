TITLE:
Insulin Resistance and Insulin Secretion

CONDITION:
Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2

INTERVENTION:
diet

SUMMARY:

      This is a pilot study to examine the prevalence of metabolic risk factors (impaired insulin
      release and impaired insulin sensitivity) for type 2 diabetes mellitus in children and
      adults from a population that is at high risk for this disease. We hypothesize that at least
      one of these pre-diabetic traits will be evident in a large proportion of relatives of known
      type 2 diabetic children as compared to a control group of subjects without a family history
      of type 2 diabetes. By isolating these traits, it will be possible to determine the relative
      contributions of genes and environment to each trait and to identify those at risk for
      subsequent development of type 2 diabetes by virtue of having one trait. Ultimately, those
      individuals at risk, especially those with impaired insulin release, would hopefully benefit
      from intervention to prevent the weight gain that will 'unmask' their underlying pancreatic
      dysfunction and thus prevent or retard the development of type 2 diabetes.
