TITLE:
A Study of Infliximab in Patients With Sarcoidosis

CONDITION:
Sarcoidosis

INTERVENTION:
Infliximab

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of infliximab
      (Remicade) in patients with Chronic Sarcoidosis. Infliximab (Remicade) targets specific
      proteins in the body's immune system to help control the development of inflammation to help
      reduce painful disease.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of infliximab in the
      treatment of subjects with sarcoidosis with pulmonary involvement who show symptoms of the
      disease even though they are currently being treated with medication. Patients will receive
      either placebo, 3 mg/kg infliximab, or 5 mg/kg infliximab infusions at weeks 0, 2, 6, 12,
      18, and 24. Safety evaluations will be performed at specified intervals throughout the study
      and will consist of laboratory tests, vital signs (such as blood pressure), physical
      examinations and the occurrence and severity of adverse events as well as other study
      specific procedures. Patients will receive infusions of Infliximab (Remicade) 3 or 5 mg/kg
      or placebo at weeks 0, 2, 6, 12, 18 and 24.
