TITLE:
Study Evaluating EAA-090 in Adult Outpatients With Neuropathic Pain Associated With Diabetic Neuropathy

Diabetes Mellitus

INTERVENTION:
EAA-090

SUMMARY:

      EAA-090 is being developed for the treatment of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic

      the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor.

      This study will assess the safety and efficacy of 3 fixed oral doses of EAA-090 compared
      with placebo in subjects with neuropathic pain associated with diabetic neuropathy.
