TITLE:
Iodine I 131 Tositumomab Followed by Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation in Treating Older Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma

CONDITION:
Lymphoma

INTERVENTION:
filgrastim

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies, such as iodine I 131 tositumomab, can locate
      cancer cells and deliver radioactive cancer-killing substances to them without harming
      normal cells. Combining a radiolabeled monoclonal antibody with autologous stem cell
      transplantation may be an effective treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining iodine I 131 tositumomab
      with autologous stem cell transplantation in treating older patients who have relapsed or
      refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the progression-free survival of older patients with relapsed or refractory
           non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with iodine I 131 tositumomab followed by autologous
           stem cell transplantation.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Radioimmunotherapy: Patients receive a test dose of iodine I 131 tositumomab on day -24
           to determine biodistribution. Patients then receive therapeutic iodine I 131
           tositumomab IV over 1 hour on day -14 and are entered into radiation isolation until
           day -4.

        -  Autologous stem cell transplantation: Patients undergo autologous bone marrow or
           peripheral blood stem cell transplantation on day 0. Patients undergoing bone marrow
           transplantation receive filgrastim (G-CSF) or sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously
           beginning on day 0 and continuing until blood counts recover.

      Patients are followed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
