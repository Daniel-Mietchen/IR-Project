TITLE:
Autologous Incubated Macrophages for Patients With Complete Spinal Cord Injuries

CONDITION:
Spinal Cord Injury

INTERVENTION:
Autologous Incubated Macrophages (cell therapy)

SUMMARY:

      Autologous Incubated Macrophages (ProCord) is being developed as a therapy for acute,
      complete spinal cord injury (SCI). The therapy is intended to reverse the loss of motor and
      sensory function.

      Following non-CNS tissue injury, macrophages quickly arrive on the scene, where they clean
      up cell debris, secrete different molecules thus promoting a controlled inflammatory
      reaction that forms the first phase of the wound healing process. While this process occurs
      in most tissues, including peripheral nerves, it does not occur in the CNS, where
      macrophages and other immune cells are relatively rare, and their activities curtailed by a
      biochemical mechanism known as "immune privilege."

      In animal studies, it appears that incubated macrophages circumvent the immune privilege,
      thus supporting the regrowth of axons through the injury site and enabling the recovery of
      neurological function. The concept derives from the pioneering research of Prof. Michal
      Schwartz at the Weizmann Institute of Science.
