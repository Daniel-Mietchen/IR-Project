TITLE:
Liposomal Doxorubicin and Interleukin-12 in Treating Patients With AIDS-Related Kaposi's Sarcoma

CONDITION:
Sarcoma

INTERVENTION:
recombinant interleukin-12

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop tumor cells from
      dividing so they stop growing or die. Interleukin-12 may kill tumor cells by stopping blood
      flow to the tumor and by stimulating a person's white blood cells to kill the tumor cells.
      Combining chemotherapy with interleukin-12 may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining liposomal doxorubicin with
      interleukin-12 in treating patients who have AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the overall response rate in patients with AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma
           (KS) treated with doxorubicin HCl liposome and interleukin-12.

        -  Determine the time to response and the number of complete responses in patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  Determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Provide pilot information on the ability of interleukin-12 to maintain major responses
           induced with paclitaxel salvage therapy in patients with aggressive or life-threatening
           KS after treatment failure with doxorubicin HCl liposome and interleukin-12.

        -  Determine the effect of this regimen on CD4 counts and viral load in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome (LipoDox) IV over 30 minutes once every 3
      weeks for a total of 6 doses. Beginning concurrently with the initiation of LipoDox,
      patients also receive interleukin-12 (IL-12) subcutaneously twice weekly (at least 3 days
      apart) for up to 3 years.

      Patients with refractory disease are transferred to the paclitaxel salvage therapy regimen
      comprising paclitaxel IV continuously on days 1-4 once every 3 weeks until a major response
      is achieved. Beginning concurrently with the initiation of paclitaxel salvage therapy,
      patients also receive IL-12 as above for up to 3 years.

      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      achieving a complete response may discontinue IL-12 administration. If necessary, IL-12
      treatment may resume at a later time.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-36 patients will be accrued for this study within 2-4
      years.
