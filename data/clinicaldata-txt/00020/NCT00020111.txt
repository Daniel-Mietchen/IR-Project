TITLE:
Arsenic Trioxide in Treating Young Patients With Refractory Leukemia or Lymphoma

CONDITION:
Leukemia

INTERVENTION:
arsenic trioxide

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop cancer cells from
      dividing so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of arsenic trioxide
      in treating young patients with leukemia or lymphoma.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the toxic effects of arsenic trioxide in pediatric patients with refractory
           leukemia or lymphoma.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this drug in this patient population.

        -  Determine the plasma pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      disease (acute promyelocytic leukemia [APL] vs non-APL).

        -  Stratum I (APL patients): Patients receive standard-dose arsenic trioxide IV over 2
           hours daily 5 days a week for 4 weeks. Treatment continues every 6 weeks for up to 3
           courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Stratum II (Non-APL patients): Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of
           arsenic trioxide (according to the stratum 1 schedule above) until the maximum
           tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
           which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the
           MTD is determined, additional patients are accrued to receive treatment with arsenic
           trioxide at the recommended phase II dose.

      Leukemia patients in both strata without progressive disease who have not achieved complete
      remission after the first 20 doses may continue to receive arsenic trioxide for 2 additional
      weeks.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 18 patients will be accrued for stratum I of this study
      within 2-3 years. A total of 3-30 patients will be accrued for stratum II of this study
      within 1-2 years.
