TITLE:
Cryosurgery in Treating Women With Breast Lesions

CONDITION:
Breast Cancer

INTERVENTION:
conventional surgery

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Cryosurgery kills cancer cells by freezing them. Cryosurgery followed by
      lumpectomy or mastectomy may be an effective treatment for breast lesions.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of cryosurgery in treating women who have
      breast lesions.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the feasibility of temperature-monitored, ultrasound-guided cryosurgery in
           women with highly suspicious breast lesions.

        -  Determine the safety of this procedure in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo cryoablation of up to two breast lesions. Within 3-21 days, patients
      undergo lumpectomy or mastectomy.

      Patients are followed at 1, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after lumpectomy or mastectomy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 25 patients will be accrued for this study.
