TITLE:
Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma of the Eye

CONDITION:
Extraocular Extension Melanoma

INTERVENTION:
gp100 antigen

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells.
      Combining vaccine therapy with interleukin-2 may be a more effective treatment for
      metastatic melanoma of the eye.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy and interleukin-2 in
      treating patients who have metastatic melanoma of the eye.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the clinical response in patients with metastatic ocular melanoma
      treated with gp100:209-217 (210M) antigen and MART-1:26-35 (27L) antigen emulsified in
      Montanide ISA-51.

      II. Determine the clinical benefit of interleukin-2 in combination with this vaccine in
      these patients.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients receive vaccine subcutaneously once weekly. Treatment repeats
      every 4 weeks for a total of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients with progressive disease may receive vaccine SC on day 1 followed by interleukin-2
      IV over 15 minutes every 8 hours for a maximum of 12 doses. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks
      for at least 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL:

      A total of 15-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
