TITLE:
Chemotherapy Followed by Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation Plus Biological Therapy in Treating Women With Stage IV Breast Cancer

CONDITION:
Breast Cancer

INTERVENTION:
therapeutic autologous lymphocytes

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell
      transplantation plus biological therapy may allow the doctor to give higher doses of
      chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well chemotherapy followed by peripheral stem
      cell transplantation plus biological therapy works in treating women with stage IV breast
      cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine whether the use of autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation
           followed by immunotherapy with activated T cells in women with stage IV breast cancer
           improves progression-free survival (PFS) compared to a reported mean PFS in patients
           treated with second-line chemotherapy with matching inclusion criteria by published
           trials.

        -  Determine if this regimen improves clinical response and overall survival.

        -  Perform sequential immune monitoring studies, including phenotyping, cytotoxic assays,
           EliSpots for IFN, selected T-cell repertoire (V analysis), HER2/new tetramer
           analysis, and serum tumor markers.

        -  Test correlations between immune function tests and clinical endpoints.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to tumor classification (chemosensitive vs
      chemoresistant).

      Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) daily for 4 days followed by
      peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) collection for PBSCT and generation of activated T
      cells (ATC). The PBMC are treated ex vivo with monoclonal antibody OKT3 to form ATC. The ATC
      are expanded for 12-14 days in interleukin-2 (IL-2).

      Patients then receive high-dose chemotherapy. Patients with chemosensitive disease receive
      cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour, thiotepa IV over 1 hour, and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on
      days -4, -3, and -2. Patients with chemoresistant disease receive ifosfamide IV over 1 hour,
      etoposide IV twice daily, and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on days -8 to -3. Patients undergo
      autologous PBSC transplantation on day 0 or on both day 0 and day 1.

      Patients then receive ATC IV over 15-20 minutes three times per week starting approximately
      on day +1 for three weeks and then once weekly for at least 6 doses.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to 2 years
      after PBSC.
