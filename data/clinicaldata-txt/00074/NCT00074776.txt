TITLE:
Acute Treatment of Bipolar II Depression

CONDITION:
Bipolar Disorder

INTERVENTION:
Lithium

SUMMARY:

      This study will compare the medications lithium and lamotrigine (Lamictal) in treating
      depression in individuals with bipolar II disorder.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Bipolar II disorder (BDII) is a serious condition characterized by depressive and hypomanic
      episodes. The disability and suicide risk associated with BDII is equal to bipolar I
      disorder. However, there are no clinical trials for BDII, nor is the treatment of BDII
      addressed in current treatment guidelines. Data suggest that Li and LTG may be effective
      treatment options for BDII. This study will determine the safety, effectiveness, and
      tolerability of the two drugs in people with BDII.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive either Li or LTG for 16
      weeks. Participants will be assessed every 2 weeks. One week after study completion,
      participants will have a follow-up visit. Measures of depression, mania, quality of life,
      functioning, and participant satisfaction will be taken.
