TITLE:
A Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Fabrazyme in Patients With Fabry Disease

CONDITION:
Fabry Disease

INTERVENTION:
Fabrazyme (agalsidase beta)

SUMMARY:

      People with Fabry disease have an alteration in their genetic material (DNA) which causes a
      deficiency of the a-galactosidase A enzyme. Fabrazyme is a drug that helps to breakdown and
      remove certain types of fatty substances called "glycolipids." These glycolipids are
      normally present within the body in most cells. In Fabry disease, glycolipids build up in
      various tissues such as the liver, kidney, skin, and blood vessels because a-galactosidase A
      is not present, or is present in small quantities. The build up of glycolipid
      ("globatriaosylceramide" or "GL-3") levels in these tissues in particular is thought to
      cause the clinical symptoms that are common to Fabry disease. This study will test the
      safety and efficacy of Fabrazyme in the treatment of patients with Fabry disease.

          -  Patient has a clinically significant organic disease (with the exception of symptoms
             related to Fabry disease), including clinically significant cardiovascular, hepatic,
             pulmonary, neurologic, or renal disease, or other medical condition, serious
             intercurrent illness, or extenuating circumstances that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would preclude participation in the study
