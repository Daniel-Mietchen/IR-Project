TITLE:
Evaluating "Health at Every Size"(HAES) as an Alternative Obesity Treatment Model

CONDITION:
Hypercholesterolemia

INTERVENTION:
Health at Every Size (HAES)

SUMMARY:

      Increasingly more individuals are trying to lose weight. Indeed, many women, regardless of
      their size, experience a life-long battle and preoccupation with their weight. Despite the
      attention to weight and the increase in diet behavior, the incidence of obesity continues to
      rise. There is little data to show improved long term success for the majority of
      participants who engage in weight loss behaviors.

      The specific aim is to improve the psychological and metabolic health of obese women with a
      history of chronic dieting through encouraging "Health at Every Size" (HAES). This treatment
      model emphasizes "intutitive eating," i.e., internal regulation of eating (responding to
      cues of hunger, appetite and satiety). The HAES model is being compared to the current
      standard of care in obesity treatment, energy restriction dieting, which encourages
      cognitive control of eating and weight reduction.
