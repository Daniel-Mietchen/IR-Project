TITLE:
A Clinical Study to Assess the Safety of PEG-Hirudin (SPP200) Compared to Heparin in Patients Who Are on Haemodialysis

CONDITION:
Chronic Kidney Failure

INTERVENTION:
PEG-hirudin

SUMMARY:

      The study will look at the safety profile (unwanted effects) of the long-lasting
      anticoagulant PEG-hirudin (SPP200) and compare these unwanted effects to those of
      unfractionated heparin, commonly used in haemodialysis to avoid clotting of the graft and of
      the haemodialysis machine.
