TITLE:
Infliximab in Treating Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome

CONDITION:
Myelodysplastic Syndromes

INTERVENTION:
infliximab

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as infliximab, can locate tumor cells and either kill
      them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of infliximab in treating
      patients who have myelodysplastic syndrome.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the therapeutic activity of 2 different doses of infliximab on peripheral
           blood cell count and peripheral and bone marrow blast cell count in patients with low-
           or intermediate-risk myelodysplastic syndromes.

        -  Determine the subjective and objective toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Determine the response rates (complete and partial response and hematological
           improvement) in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the duration of response in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to cytogenetics (good vs intermediate vs unknown due to failure), overall
      International Prognostic Scoring System score (low [0] vs intermediate 1 [0.5-1.0] vs
      intermediate 2 [1.5-2.0]), and participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive infliximab IV on days 1, 15, 43, 71, 99, 127, 155, and 183 in
           the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive a higher dose of infliximab as in arm I. Patients achieving
           response (complete or partial response or hematological improvement) continue therapy
           beyond day 183 in the absence of disease progression.

      Patients are followed at 2 weeks and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients (40 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 2 years.
