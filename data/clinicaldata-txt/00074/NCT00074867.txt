TITLE:
Study Of An Oral Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Of VEGFR-2 To Treat Small-Volume Ovarian, Peritoneal, Fallopian Tube Cancer

CONDITION:
Ovarian Neoplasms

INTERVENTION:
CP-547,632

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether CP-547,632, an oral VEGFR-2 tyrosine
      kinase inhibitor is effective in the treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer, primary
      peritoneal serous cancer, or fallopian tube cancer for patients who have failed first line
      platinum-based therapy and have a persistent rising CA-125.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
NONE

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: Female
Age: 18 Years to N/A
Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically proven epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal serous cancer, or
             fallopian tube cancerRecurrent or persistent elevated CA-125.

          -  For the purpose of this study, elevated CA-125 is defined as a value of 40 U/ml on
             two separate consecutive determinations made 1 week apart.

          -  CA-125 values obtained within 4 weeks of abdominal surgery should not be taken into
             account.

          -  No definitive disease or clinical and findings of small volume disease (&#163;1cm by
             spiral CT or &#163;2cm by conventional CT or clinical exam).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No prior exposure to mouse antibodies or prior VEGF or VEGF receptor targeted
             treatment or other anti-angiogenic-directed, anti-cancer treatment including
             thalidomide.

          -  No prior consolidation therapy with cytotoxic agents for ovarian cancer.

          -  Continuation of hormone replacement therapy is permitted.

          -  No requirement for concomitant anticoagulant therapy.

          -  Administration of low dose anticoagulants for maintenance of central venous access is
             permitted.No chronic oral or intravenous steroid use.
