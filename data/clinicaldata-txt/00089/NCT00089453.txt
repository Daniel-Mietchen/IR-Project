TITLE:
Study of KIR-Ligand Mismatched Haplo-Identical Natural Killer Cells Transfused Before Autologous Stem Cell Transplant

CONDITION:
Multiple Myeloma

INTERVENTION:
Dexamethasone

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to induce anti-myeloma responses in patients with high risk or
      relapsed myeloma using combination chemo- and immunotherapy comprising sequentially: 1)
      lymphoid and myeloid suppressive conditioning, 2) adoptive transfer of purified KIR-ligand
      mismatched Natural Killer cells from a haplo-identical donor, and 3) autografting two weeks
      after infusion of NK cells to ensure autologous reconstitution. Other objectives include
      establishing the response rate, disease free survival, progression free survival and
      toxicity of regimen. Secondary objectives are to monitor the persistence of haplo-identical
      purified KIR-ligand mismatched Natural Killer cells by molecular methods, select
      haplo-identical purified KIR-ligand mismatched donors and predict prior to therapy which
      donor will induce a response, monitor Natural Killer cell reconstitution prior to and after
      autografting, and establish Natural Killer cell clones after autografting and determine
      origin and specificity.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      This study will induce anti-myeloma responses in patients with high risk or relapsed myeloma
      using combination chemo- and immunotherapy comprising sequentially: 1) lymphoid suppressive
      conditioning to avoid rejection of the donor NK cells, 2) adoptive transfer of purified
      KIR-ligand mismatched Natural Killer cells from a haplo-identical donor, and 3) autografting
      two weeks after infusion of NK cells to ensure autologous reconstitution.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 18 Years to N/A
Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  MM in frank relapse after a single or tandem transplant or high risk Myeloma

          -  Patients with prior transplant must be more than 4 months after the last transplant

          -  Karnofsky performance score >or =70, or a performance score of 50-70 exclusively due
             to bone pain caused by myeloma

          -  18 years of age or older

          -  An expected survival greater than 3 months

          -  ANC >1,000/microliters, platelet count > 100,000/microliters

          -  Donor and patient must have signed an IRB-approved consent and been informed about
             the investigational nature of the study

          -  Donor must have negative serology for HIV

          -  Available haplo-identical family donor fit to undergo leukapheresis and mismatched
             for KIR-ligand(s) with the patient in the graft-versus host direction.

          -  Stored cells for autografting of at least 30 million CD34+ cells/kg

          -  Back-up cells of at least 20 million CD34+ cells/kg in case of non-engraftment.

          -  There must be an unambiguous marker for response to therapy in the first ten
             patients. Therefore the patient must have detectable and quantifiable M-protein or
             light chain excretion in urine, light chain quantification in serum (FREELITE) or
             clear radiological signal lesion(s) in order to be eligible

          -  After 10 relapsed patients have been treated and toxicity is deemed acceptable,
             high-risk myeloma (defined as the presence of abnormal cytogenetics or metaphase
             analysis) patients without relapse can be entered

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Intravenous chemotherapy or antibody therapy affecting T-lymphocytes and/or natural
             killer cells e.g. cyclophosphamide, melphalan, ATG, Campath-1H etc. within the past 2
             weeks prior to commencement of conditioning. Last therapy is less than 14 days prior
             to starting fludarabine

          -  Fever or active infection, requiring IV antibiotics

          -  Liver function: total bilirubin > 2xULN or AST/ALT >3xULN

          -  Renal function: patients on dialysis
