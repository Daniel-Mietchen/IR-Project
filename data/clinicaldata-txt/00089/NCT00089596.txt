TITLE:
Infusion of Specially Treated Umbilical Cord Stem Cells After Chemoradiation Treatment for Blood Cancers

CONDITION:
Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia

INTERVENTION:
Expansion of umbilical cord stem cells

SUMMARY:

      This study hopes to show that specially treated umbilical cord cells, called stem cells, can
      be safely given to a person after they receive chemoradiation therapy or chemotherapy for
      their illness. During chemoradiation therapy or chemotherapy, a person loses all of the
      cells that are needed to make the different types of cells in their blood, including their
      immune system cells. These cells must be replaced in order for the blood and immune systems
      to work properly. Some people receive bone marrow transplants or other types of stem cell
      transplants to get the cells they need. CB001 is being developed as an option for people who
      need bone marrow transplants or other types of transplants to replace those cells. It is
      also being developed for people who do not have the option of other types of transplants.
