TITLE:
SPRiNG: SCIO-469 Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis Not Receiving Methotrexate

CONDITION:
Arthritis, Rheumatoid

INTERVENTION:
SCIO-469

SUMMARY:

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of oral SCIO-469 in
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis who are not receiving liver damaging (hepatotoxic)
      disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs).
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      This is a 24 week randomized (study drug assigned by chance), double blind (neither
      physician nor patient knows the name of the assigned drug), placebo controlled, parallel
      group study assessing the safety and effectiveness of oral SCIO-469 in treating patients
      with rheumatoid arthritis who are not receiving liver damaging (hepatotoxic)
      disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). The patient will participate in the study
      for approximately 183 days. Safety measures will include vital signs (blood pressure, pulse
      rate, breathing rate), 12-lead electro-cardiogram, adverse events, concomitant medications,
      and clinical laboratory evaluations (including serum chemistry, hematology, qualitative
      urinalysis, and liver function tests). The patient may be assigned to receive 30 mg capsule
      orally (by mouth) as one or two capsules three times daily, or receive 100 mg tablet orally
      once daily, or placebo (no active drug) orally as two capsules three times daily and placebo
      tablet orally once daily for 24 weeks.
