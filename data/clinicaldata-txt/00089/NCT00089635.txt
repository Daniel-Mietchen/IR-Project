TITLE:
ABX-EGF (Panitumumab) Monotherapy in Subjects With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer

CONDITION:
Colorectal Cancer

INTERVENTION:
ABX-EGF (panitumumab)

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to determine that ABX-EGF (panitumumab) will have clinically
      meaningful anti-tumor activity in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have
      developed progressive disease or relapsed while on or after prior fluoropyrimidine,
      irinotecan and oxaliplatin chemotherapy.

Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathologic diagnosis of colorectal adenocarcinoma (diagnostic tissue obtained by
             tissue biopsy)

          -  Metastatic colorectal carcinoma

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group of 0, 1 or 2

          -  Documented evidence of disease progression during, or following treatment, with
             fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan and oxaliplatin chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal
             cancer

          -  Radiographic documentation of disease progression during or within 6 months following
             the most recent chemotherapy regimen is required

          -  Bidimensionally measurable disease

          -  Tumor expressing low to negative levels of EGFr by immunohistochemistry

          -  At least 2 but no more than 3 prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic colorectal
             cancer

          -  Adequate hematologic, renal and hepatic function

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Symptomatic brain metastases requiring treatment

          -  Patient with a history of interstitial pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis or evidence
             of interstitial pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis

          -  Use of systemic chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 30 days before enrollment

          -  Prior anti-EGFr antibody therapy with the exception of the small molecule EGFr
             tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which are permitted

          -  Prior anti-tumor therapies including prior experimental agents or approved anti-tumor
             small molecules and biologics of short (less than 1 week) serum half-life within 30
             days before enrollment, or prior experimental or approved proteins within 6 weeks
             before enrollment
