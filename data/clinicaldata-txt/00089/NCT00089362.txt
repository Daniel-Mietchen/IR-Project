TITLE:
Alvespimycin Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Unresectable Solid Tumors

CONDITION:
Male Breast Cancer

INTERVENTION:
alvespimycin hydrochloride

SUMMARY:

      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of alvespimycin hydrochloride
      in treating patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as alvespimycin hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop tumor cells
      from dividing so they stop growing or die.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the toxic effects and maximum tolerated dose of
      17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG) in patients with metastatic or
      unresectable solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      II. Determine the effects of this drug on the expression of Hsp90 client proteins in normal
      and tumor tissue samples from these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive alvespimycin hydrochloride IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 1-2 patients receive accelerated escalating doses of alvespimycin hydrochloride
      until at least 1 of 2 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Cohorts are then
      expanded to 3-6 patients who receive escalating doses (in a standard manner) of alvespimycin
      hydrochloride until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as
      the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience DLT. Once the MTD is
      determined, 10 additional patients are treated at that dose.
