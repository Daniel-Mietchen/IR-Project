TITLE:
Phase I/II Trial of Redox Regulation in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory CD20+ NHL

CONDITION:
Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL)

INTERVENTION:
Rituxan

SUMMARY:

      Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab and yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan can locate
      cancer cells and either kill them or deliver radioactive cancer-killing substances to them
      without harming normal cells. Motexafin gadolinium may increase the effectiveness of yttrium
      Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan by making the cancer cells more sensitive to the drug.

      This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of motexafin gadolinium
      when administered with rituximab and yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan and to see how well
      they work in treating patients with stage II, stage III, or stage IV relapsed or refractory
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of motexafin gadolinium followed by a phase II
      study. Patients are stratified according to extent of lymphomatous involvement ( 5% vs > 5
      but  24% of cellular elements).

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients in each stratum receive escalating doses of motexafin gadolinium
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at
      which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) OR the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 3 of 6 patients experience DLT.

        -  Once the MTD is determined, additional patients are treated at that dose level as in
           phase I.

      Patients are followed weekly for 3 months and then monthly for 5 years.
