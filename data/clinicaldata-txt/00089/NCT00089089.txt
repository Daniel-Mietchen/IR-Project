TITLE:
Decitabine in Treating Patients With Advanced Refractory Solid Tumors or Lymphomas

CONDITION:
Hematopoietic/Lymphoid Cancer

INTERVENTION:
decitabine

SUMMARY:

      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of decitabine in treating
      patients with metastatic or unresectable refractory solid tumors or lymphomas. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as decitabine, work in different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of single agent decitabine and its toxicity using
      this schedule in this population of patients with solid tumors or lymphomas.

      II. Definition of the dose at which tumor DNA demethylation is optimum. III. Definition of
      the dose at which peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMN) demethylation is optimal.

      IV. Definition of decitabine pharmacokinetics and correlation of plasma concentrations with
      hypomethylation effects.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Preliminary assessment of decitabine efficacy (objective response).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive decitabine IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 or on days 1-5 and 8-12. Courses
      repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of decitabine until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 18 Years to N/A
Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed malignancy (solid tumor or lymphoma) that
             is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative or palliative measures
             do not exist or are no longer effective

          -  Patients must have had >= 1 prior chemotherapy regimen; there is no maximum allowable
             number of prior regimens, provided all other eligibility criteria are met

          -  Patients must be >= 6 weeks beyond treatment with a nitrosourea or mitomycin-C, >= 4
             weeks beyond other chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and must have recovered to =< grade
             1 toxicity for any treatment-limiting toxicity of prior therapy; (Exception: patients
             may have received palliative low dose radiotherapy to the limbs 1-4 weeks before this
             therapy, provided pelvis, ribs, sternum, scapulae, vertebrae or skull were not
             included in the radiotherapy field)

          -  ECOG performance status =< 2 (Karnofsky >= 60%); (Exception: Patients with brain
             metastases must be ECOG performance status 0-1)

          -  Leukocytes >= 3,000/L

          -  Absolute neutrophil count >= 1,500/L

          -  Platelets >= 140,000/L

          -  Total bilirubin =< 1.0 mg/dL

          -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) =< 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal

          -  Creatinine (serum) =< 1.5 mg/dL

          -  PT within institutional guideline for biopsy procedure (=< to 16 seconds)

          -  The effects of decitabine on the developing human fetus are unknown; for this reason
             and because chemotherapy agents are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing
             potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier
             method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of
             study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
             document, including consent for the required tumor biopsy, blood and pharmacokinetics
             studies

          -  Tumor accessible for repeat biopsy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered to =< grade 1 treatment-limiting toxicity levels for adverse events due to
             agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier; (Exception: patients may have received
             palliative low dose radiotherapy to the limbs 1-4 weeks before this therapy provided
             pelvis, ribs, sternum, scapulae, vertebrae or skull were not included in the
             radiotherapy field)

          -  Patients who have had surgery within 2 weeks prior to entering the study

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Patients with known brain metastases to whom any of the following apply:

               -  Have not received prior cranial irradiation

               -  Are requiring > 8 mg dexamethasone per day (or equivalent other steroid) to
                  maintain an ECOG performance status =< 1

               -  Have had a seizure (focal or generalized) in the last 3 weeks

               -  If steroids required to maintain an ECOG performance status =< 1 have increased
                  in the past 2 weeks

               -  Take enzyme-inducing anti-convulsants

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to decitabine

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,
             potentially life threatening cardiac arrhythmia, systolic BP < 90 mmHg or > 160 mmHg,
             diastolic BP < 50 mmHg or > 110 mmHg, psychiatric illness/social situations that
             would limit compliance with study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because decitabine is an antimetabolite
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with decitabine, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with decitabine

          -  Because patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections
             when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy, patients known to be HIV-positive and
             receiving anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible
             pharmacokinetic interactions with decitabine
