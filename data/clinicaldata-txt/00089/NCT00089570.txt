Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Chronic, or acute liver disease

          -  Rapidly progressive reduction in renal function, e.g. doubling of serum creatinine to
             >2.5 mg/dL in less than two weeks.

          -  No sustained improvement in renal function after diuretic withdrawal and plasma
             volume expansion

          -  Proteinuria <500 mg per day

          -  No evidence of granular casts in urinalysis or ultrasonographic evidence of
             obstructive uropathy or parenchymal renal disease

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Ongoing shock

          -  Uncontrolled bacterial infection

          -  Current significant fluid losses

          -  Current or recent treatment with nephrotoxic drugs (e.g. NSAIDs or aminoglycosides
             within 4 weeks)

          -  Acute liver disease due to factors known to be also directly nephrotoxic (e.g.
             acetaminophen overdose)

          -  Confirmed pregnancy

          -  Severe cardiovascular disease

          -  Evidence of intrinsic or parenchymal renal disease (e.g. acute tubular necrosis)

          -  Participation in other clinical studies within 30 days
