TITLE:
Study Evaluating Interferon And CCI-779 In Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma

CONDITION:
Carcinoma, Renal Cell

INTERVENTION:
Interferon Alfa

SUMMARY:

      The primary objective of this study is efficacy. The primary efficacy endpoint of this study
      is a comparison of the overall survival of subjects treated with CCI-779 [Temsirolimus],
      administered intravenously [IV] once weekly and the combination of CCI-779, administered IV
      once weekly with Interferon Alfa [IFN alfa] subcutaneously [SC] three times per week [TIW],
      compared with the overall survival of subjects treated with IFN alfa (SC TIW) alone, in
      poor-prognosis subjects with advanced RCC.
