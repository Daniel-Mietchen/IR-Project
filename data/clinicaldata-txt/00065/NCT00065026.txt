TITLE:
Increasing Physical Activity Levels in Low-Income Women

CONDITION:
Healthy

INTERVENTION:
Physical activity opportunities for low-income women

SUMMARY:

      Regular physical activity is important for good health. Women, particularly women with low
      incomes, have many personal barriers to regular physical activity. The purpose of this study
      is to reduce environmental barriers to physical activity for women in two specific
      low-income neighborhoods (in Louisville, KY) by providing opportunities for safe physical
      activity and addressing barriers such as lack of child care. Two groups of women will have
      pretest information (cholesterol, blood sugar, blood pressure, percent body fat, height,
      weight, waist and hip measurements) collected and the same information 6 months later at
      post-test. One group will have access to multiple physical activity opportunities in their
      neighborhood and at the neighborhood community center. An advanced registered nurse
      practitioner will facilitate the activity opportunities. The groups will be compared on
      their pretest and post-test information to see if the group with the physical activity
      opportunities has increased physical activity as measured by pedometer and self-report
      questionnaire, and to see if there are changes in the measures tested at pre and post
      (measures that may be improved by regular physical activity).
