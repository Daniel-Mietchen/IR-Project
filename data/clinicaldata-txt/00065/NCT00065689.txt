TITLE:
High Intensity Light Therapy in Alzheimer's Disease

CONDITION:
Alzheimer's Disease

INTERVENTION:
high-intensity light therapy

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether bright light improves the sleep, mood, and
      behavior of persons with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD) who live in
      long-term care settings and, if so, to determine the best timing for the light therapy. The
      light levels being used in the study have been shown to improve depression in persons with
      seasonal affective disorder (SAD) and to relieve sleep problems in persons with jet lag and
      other body rhythm disturbances. Because persons with AD often will not remain still in front
      of a fluorescent panel, this project has involved renovations in the study units that
      provide for even, regulated, high-intensity light in all public areas of the study settings.
