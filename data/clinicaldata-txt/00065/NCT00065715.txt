TITLE:
Echinacea Versus Placebo Effect in Common Cold (Physician Echinacea Placebo)

CONDITION:
Common Cold

INTERVENTION:
Echinacea

SUMMARY:

      The design and interpretation of randomized trials is intimately connected to the use of
      "placebo". The nature and magnitude of placebo effects, however, is very poorly understood.
      This study will assess and compare placebo effects and physician interaction effects within
      a community-acquired common cold model. The goal of this study is to assess two kinds of
      placebo affects and how physician interaction effects;

        1. The effect of receiving blinded placebo, compared to no treatment; and

        2. The effect of receiving open-label active Echinacea treatment compared to blinded
           active treatment.
