TITLE:
Effects of Inhaled Nitric Oxide in the Treatment of Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure (AHRF) in Pediatrics

CONDITION:
Respiratory Insufficiency

INTERVENTION:
Nitrogen gas

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of nitric oxide for inhalation on the
      duration of mechanical ventilation in pediatric patients with AHRF.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Patients will receive 5-ppm study gas (nitric oxide for inhalation or placebo) until Day 28
      or extubation, whichever comes first. The following will be performed / recorded at
      specified times during the study: arterial blood gases, ventilator settings, methemoglobin,
      PRISM III score, and patient positioning. Selected centers will also be performing plasma
      cytokine assays, broncho-alveolar lavage fluid assays and a 6 month follow-up assessment.
