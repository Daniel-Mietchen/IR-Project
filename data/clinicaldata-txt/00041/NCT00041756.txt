TITLE:
Efficacy and Safety of PG-530742 in the Treatment of Mild to Moderate Knee Osteoarthritis

CONDITION:
Osteoarthritis, Knee

INTERVENTION:
PG-530742

SUMMARY:

      Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been implicated in the cartilage degradation.
      PG-530742 inhibits some MMPs, potentially limiting cartilage degradation and disease
      progression. This study will test the efficacy and safety of PG-530742 in the treatment of
      mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Matrix metalloproteinases have been implicated in the cartilage degradation that occurs in
      osteoarthritis. PG-530742 inhibits some of these matrix metalloproteinases, thus potentially
      limiting cartilage degradation and disease progression. This study will test the efficacy
      and safety of PG-530742 in the treatment of mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 40 Years to 80 Years
Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis confirmed by a radiographic technique.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  secondary knee osteoarthritis;

          -  diseases other than osteoarthritis that could cause knee pain;

          -  any disease or intervention (surgery, intra-articular injection) that would have an
             impact on knee pain or mobility;

          -  drugs that act potentially on the bone or cartilage component of the knee joint.
