TITLE:
Assessing Quality of Life of Patients With Prostate Cancer

CONDITION:
Prostate Cancer

INTERVENTION:
QoL assessment

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Quality of life assessment in patients undergoing prostate cancer treatment may
      help determine the intermediate and long-term effects of the treatment on these patients.

      PURPOSE: Clinical trial to study the effectiveness of two questionnaires in assessing
      quality of life of patients who have prostate cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Assess the scale structure, psychometric validity, and reliability of quality of life
           measurements using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the prostate cancer-specific QLQ-PR25
           questionnaires in patients with stage I-IV prostate cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to stage of disease
      (local or locally advanced disease vs metastatic disease).

      Patients complete EORTC QLQ-C30 and prostate cancer-specific QLQ-PR25 questionnaires before
      therapy and at 3 months after the start of therapy. Patients in stratum II also complete
      questionnaires at 6 months after the start of therapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 375 patients will be accrued for this study.
