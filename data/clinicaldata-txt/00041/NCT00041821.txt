TITLE:
Nasal Irritation Study: Individual Factors in Nasal Irritant Sensitivity

CONDITION:
Rhinitis, Allergic, Nonseasonal

INTERVENTION:
Nasal irritation thresholds and irritant provocation

SUMMARY:

      This study seeks to document differences in nasal irritant sensitivity within the
      population. The investigators are interested in knowing whether age, gender, and allergy
      status (nasal allergies) predict nasal irritant sensitivity. This is important in
      understanding symptom reporting patterns in air pollution situations (particularly in
      so-called "problem buildings"), as well as in understanding the reflex mechanism of a
      response of the nose to irritants (e.g., nasal congestion).
