TITLE:
Safety Study of 90Y-hMN14 to Treat Colorectal Cancer Patients With Limited Residual Disease After Surgery

CONDITION:
Colorectal Neoplasms

INTERVENTION:
hMN14 (labetuzumab)

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this trial is to determine the safety of 90Y-hMN14 at different dose levels
      in the treatment of residual colorectal cancer following recent surgery.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
NONE

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 18 Years to N/A
Criteria:

        Disease Characteristics:

          -  Patients with documented histologic and cytologic diagnosis of colon or rectal
             malignancy

          -  Patients with documented status post surgical resection of primary cancer or
             metastases

          -  Limited residual disease (i.e., CEA serum levels < 15 ng/mL and negative baseline CT
             scans, or no lesion > 1 cm)

        Prior/Concurrent Therapy:

          -  Patients must have completed chemotherapeutic agents, biologic therapy, radiotherapy,
             other investigational therapy for cancer, or surgical procedures at least six weeks
             prior to study entry.

          -  Patients must have recuperated from surgery and toxicities (as a result of previous
             therapy) sufficiently prior to study entry

          -  Biologic Therapy: Patients who have received a murine, chimeric, CDR-grafted
             (humanized), or human IgG will be eligible provided pre-study evaluations demonstrate
             no significant reactivity with hMN-14 IgG (i.e., HAHA)

          -  Radiotherapy: No prior external beam irradiation to a field that includes more than
             30% of the red marrow. No prior radiation to maximal tolerable levels for any
             critical organs (e.g., 3000 cGy for the liver; 2000 cGy for the lungs and kidneys)

        Patient Characteristics/Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Performance Status: Patients with Karnofsky performance status > 70%

          -  Hematopoietic: ANC >/= 1.5 x 10/L; Hemoglobin >/= 10 g/dL; Platelets >/= 100 x 10/L

          -  Renal: Serum Creatinine </= 1.5 x ULN

          -  Hepatic: Serum Bilirubin </= 1.5 ULN; AST and ALT </= 2.5 x ULN; Alk Phosphatase </=
             2.5 x ULN

          -  Cardiovascular: Patients with LVEF >/= 50% by required MUGA/2D-ECHO tests

          -  Pulmonary: Patients with DF and FEV1 >/= 60% by required Pulmonary Function Tests

          -  Central Nervous System: Patients with known metastatic disease to the CNS are
             excluded.

          -  Other: Patients agreeing to use a medically effective method of contraception during
             and for a period of three months after the treatment period. A pregnancy test will be
             preformed on each premenopausal female of childbearing potential immediately prior to
             entry into study. Patients must understand and give written informed consent.
