TITLE:
Imatinib Mesylate in Treating Patients With Primary Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor That Has Been Completely Removed By Surgery

CONDITION:
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor

INTERVENTION:
imatinib mesylate

SUMMARY:

      This randomized phase III trial is studying imatinib mesylate to see how well it works
      compared to placebo in treating patients with primary gastrointestinal stromal tumor that
      has been completely removed by surgery. Imatinib mesylate may interfere with the growth of
      tumor cells and may be an effective treatment for patients with primary gastrointestinal
      stromal tumor that has been completely removed by surgery.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether patients with resected primary gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)
      who are randomized to the STI571 (imatinib mesylate) Arm have longer recurrence-free
      survival as compared to the patients randomized to the placebo Arm.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To ascertain whether patients with resected primary GIST who are randomized to the STI571
      Arm have longer survival as compared to the patients randomized to the placebo Arm.

      II. To obtain from patients with GIST: tumor tissue (before therapy with STI571 and if the
      patient develops recurrence), blood specimens (before therapy with STI571), and serum
      specimens (before therapy with STI571, after completing therapy with STI571, and if the
      patient develops recurrence) for scientific correlative analyses.

      III. To assess the safety/efficacy of oral STI571 therapy in the adjuvant setting.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate (Gleevec; STI571) once daily. Treatment
      continues for 1 year in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients who develop a
      recurrence during the year of initial treatment receive imatinib mesylate (Gleevec; STI571)
      at an increased dose. Patients who develop a recurrence after the year of initial treatment
      restart imatinib mesylate (Gleevec; STI571) and continue taking the drug at the discretion
      of the principal investigator.

      ARM II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily. Treatment continues for 1 year in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients who develop a recurrence at any time discontinue
      placebo and crossover to arm I. Treatment on arm I continues at the discretion of the
      principal investigator.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 10 years.

Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must have an ECOG/Zubrod performance status of =< 2

          -  Patient must have a histologic diagnosis of primary GIST (without peritoneal or
             distant metastasis) that expresses Kit protein by immunohistochemistry and have tumor
             size >= 3cm in maximum dimension

          -  Patient must have undergone complete gross resection (includes R0 [negative
             microscopic margins] and R1 [positive microscopic margins]) of a primary GIST within
             70 days prior to registration

          -  Patient must have a chest x-ray completed within 28 days prior to registration; NOTE:
             Chest CT within 28 days prior to registration can be used in lieu of chest x-ray

          -  Patient must have a post-operative CT scan with IV and PO contrast or MRI with
             contrast (if allergic to CT contrast) of abdomen and pelvis within 28 days prior to
             registration

          -  Creatinine =< 1.5 times the institution ULN

          -  WBC >= 2,000/mm^3

          -  Platelets >= 100,000/mm^3

          -  Total Bilirubin =< 1.5 times the institution ULN; NOTE: Patients with elevated
             bilirubin secondary to Gilbert's disease are eligible to participate in the study

          -  AST =< 2.5 times the institution ULN

          -  ALT =< 2.5 times the institution ULN

          -  Female of childbearing potential must have negative serum pregnancy test; NOTE:
             Post-menopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be deemed not of
             reproductive potential

          -  Patient or the patient's legally acceptable representative must provide a signed and
             dated written informed consent prior to registration and any study-related procedures

          -  Patient must provide written authorization to allow the use and disclosure of their
             protected health information; NOTE: This may be obtained in either the study-specific
             informed consent or in a separate authorization form and must be obtained from the
             patient prior to study registration (non-US sites are exempt from HIPAA regulations)

          -  If patient is a cancer survivor, ALL of the following criteria apply:

               -  No evidence of any prior malignancies for at least 5 years with no evidence of
                  recurrence (except for effectively treated basal cell or squamous carcinoma of
                  the skin, carcinoma in-situ of the cervix that has been effectively treated by
                  surgery alone, or lobular carcinoma in-situ of the ipsilateral or contralateral

          -  Patient, if female and breastfeeding; NOTE: It is not known whether STI571or its
             metabolites are excreted in human milk; however, in lactating female rats
             administered 100mg/kg, a dose approximately equal to the maximum clinical dose of
             800mg/day based on body surface area, STI571 and /or its metabolites were extensively
             excreted in milk; it is estimated that approximately 1.5% of a maternal dose is
             excreted into milk, which is equivalent to a dose to the infant of 30% the maternal
             dose per unit body weight; women should be advised against breastfeeding while taking
             STI571
