TITLE:
Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer

CONDITION:
Lung Cancer

INTERVENTION:
carboplatin

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of carboplatin, gemcitabine, and
      exisulind in treating patients who have advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the 18-month survival rate in patients with advanced non-small cell lung
           cancer treated with carboplatin, gemcitabine, and exisulind.

        -  Determine the feasibility and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the response rate, progression-free survival, and overall median survival of
           patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 and carboplatin IV
      over 30 minutes on day 1. Chemotherapy repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses. Patients
      also receive oral exisulind twice daily beginning on day 1 of course 1 and continuing until
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 55 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 months.
