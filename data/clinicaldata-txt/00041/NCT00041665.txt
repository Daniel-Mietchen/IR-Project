TITLE:
Recombinant Human Keratinocyte Growth Factor to Reduce Oral Mucositis in Hematologic Malignancy Patients Undergoing Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation After Radiation and High-dose Chemotherapy

CONDITION:
Stomatitis

INTERVENTION:
Recombinant Human Keratinocyte Growth Factor

SUMMARY:

      Radiotherapy and high dose chemotherapy with bone marrow transplantation or peripheral blood
      stem cell transplantation is frequently used as treatment for patients with cancers of the
      bone marrow or lymph nodes such as Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, leukemia or
      multiple myeloma. A common side effect of the radiotherapy and high dose chemotherapy is
      mucositis (inflammation of the inside of the mouth and throat resulting in pain and
      difficulty swallowing). Mucositis is often very severe such that patients receive
      intravenous nutrition and pain medication in the hospital.

      In this study, an investigational recombinant human growth factor called Keratinocyte Growth
      Factor (rHuKGF) is being evaluated to determine its protective effect on the mucosal tissue
      and its ability to reduce the mouth and throat soreness.
