TITLE:
Effectiveness and Safety of INGN 201 in Combination With Chemotherapy Versus Chemotherapy Alone

CONDITION:
Carcinoma, Squamous Cell

INTERVENTION:
INGN 201

SUMMARY:

      There is a need for more treatment options for patients with recurrent squamous cell cancer
      of the head and neck (SCCHN). These tumors usually have a variety of genetic defects that
      include disruption of the p53 pathway, a pathway that would ordinarily work to prevent the
      development of tumors. In this study the transfer of the p53 gene to tumor cells using a
      modified adenovirus (INGN 201) in combination with chemotherapy (cisplatin and fluorouracil)
      will be compared to chemotherapy with cisplatin and fluorouracil in patients who have failed
      surgery and radiotherapy.
