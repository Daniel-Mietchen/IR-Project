TITLE:
IH636 Grape Seed Extract in Treating Hardening of Breast Tissue in Women Who Have Undergone Radiation Therapy for Early Breast Cancer

CONDITION:
Breast Cancer

INTERVENTION:
IH636 grape seed proanthocyanidin extract

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: IH636 grape seed extract may lessen hardening of breast tissue caused by
      radiation therapy and may help patients live more comfortably.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of IH636 grape seed extract in
      treating hardening of breast tissue in women who have undergone radiation therapy for early
      breast cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy of IH636 grape seed proanthocyanidin extract for the treatment
           of radiation-induced fibrosis after high-dose radiotherapy in women with a history of
           early breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are
      stratified according to time since prior radiotherapy. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral IH636 grape seed proanthocyanidin extract three times
           daily for 6 months.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive an oral placebo three times daily for 6 months. Patients are
           followed at 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 72 patients (48 for arm I and 24 for arm II) will be accrued
      for this study.
