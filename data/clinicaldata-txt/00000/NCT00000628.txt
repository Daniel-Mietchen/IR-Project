TITLE:
A Pharmacokinetic Study of L-697,661 Alone and in Combination With Zidovudine

CONDITION:
HIV Infections

INTERVENTION:
L-697,661

SUMMARY:

      Part 1: To study the potential safety and pharmacokinetic (blood level) effects of
      zidovudine (AZT) on L-697,661; to obtain additional pharmacokinetic information in humans
      with L-697,661; to study the effect of L-697,661 on hepatic enzyme induction. Part 2: To
      begin a study of the antiviral activity of L-697,661.

      L-697,661 is a newly identified compound that inhibits HIV replication (reproduction and
      growth) in cell culture. It works together with AZT against HIV.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      L-697,661 is a newly identified compound that inhibits HIV replication (reproduction and
      growth) in cell culture. It works together with AZT against HIV.

      Part 1: Twelve patients are randomly assigned to one of two groups. Group 1 patients receive
      AZT for 7 days, followed by AZT plus L-697,661 with food for 56 days. Group 2 patients
      receive no drug for 7 days, followed by L-697,661 with food for 56 days. Antipyrine is
      administered 1 hour prior to study drug on days 8, 22, and 35.

      Part 2: Fifteen patients receive L-697,661 with food, for 8 weeks. Therapy with L-697,661
      may be extended beyond 8 weeks for up to 24 weeks.

             of at least 500 mg/day without evidence of toxicity.

          -  Patients in Part 2 must have received no previous AZT or = or > 300 mg/day for < 6
             consecutive weeks within 1 year prior to study entry.

          -  Wilson's or Gilbert's disease, porphyria, or other chronic or acute hepatic disease.

          -  Potentially life-threatening allergic reactions to any of the components of
             zidovudine.

          -  Acute or chronic medical conditions that in the opinion of the investigator would
             place patient at risk by participation in this study.

        Concurrent Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Systemic bronchodilators, acetaminophen, aspirin.

             warfarin, ketoconazole, and oral contraceptives, within 30 days prior to entry.

        Patients in Part 2 only:

        Excluded:

          -  Zidovudine within 4 weeks prior to receiving first dose of study drug.

        Risk Behavior:

        Excluded:

          -  Patients who the investigator feels would not comply with study requirements.

        Patients may not have the following prior conditions:

          -  Acute or chronic medical conditions that in the opinion of the investigator would
