TITLE:
Effect of Fluconazole, Clarithromycin, and Rifabutin on the Pharmacokinetics of Sulfamethoxazole-Trimethoprim and Dapsone and Their Hydroxylamine Metabolites

CONDITION:
Bacterial Infections

INTERVENTION:
Clarithromycin

SUMMARY:

      To determine the effects of fluconazole and either rifabutin or clarithromycin, alone and in
      combination, on the pharmacokinetics of first sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and then dapsone
      in HIV-infected patients.

      Although prophylaxis for more than one opportunistic infection is emerging as a common
      clinical practice in patients with advanced HIV disease, little is known about possible
      adverse drug interactions. The need exists to define pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic
      adverse interactions of the many combination prophylactic regimens that may be prescribed.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Although prophylaxis for more than one opportunistic infection is emerging as a common
      clinical practice in patients with advanced HIV disease, little is known about possible
      adverse drug interactions. The need exists to define pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic
      adverse interactions of the many combination prophylactic regimens that may be prescribed.

      In Part A, patients receive sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) alone for 2 weeks, then
      in combination with fluconazole, rifabutin, or both drugs, each over 2-week periods in a
      randomly assigned order. Patients in Part B receive the same regimens except with
      clarithromycin substituted for rifabutin. In Part C, patients receive dapsone alone for 2
      weeks, then in combination with fluconazole, rifabutin, or both drugs in the same manner as
      in Part A. Part D patients receive the same regimen as those in Part C, except with
      clarithromycin substituted for rifabutin. Patients are followed every 2 weeks.
