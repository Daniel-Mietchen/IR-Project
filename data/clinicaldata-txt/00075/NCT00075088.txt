TITLE:
Tele-Electrocardiography in Emergency Cardiac Care

CONDITION:
Myocardial Infarction

INTERVENTION:
Electrocardiogram (ECG) Intervention

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to see whether individuals who access the "911" emergency
      medical system with a heart attack or severe chest pain will receive more timely hospital
      treatment and better outcomes if hospital clinicians are provided with earlier and more
      complete electrocardiography (ECG) information.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      This is a Phase III study. Patients will be randomized (like tossing a coin) to 1 of 2
      groups: Group 1: Patients will have pre-hospital ECG intervention. Group 2: Patients will
      have routine emergency heart care. Information will be collected about time symptoms
      started, clinical management, and other measures. All patients will be contacted by
      telephone 12 months later and interviewed as to whether they experienced any cardiac
      symptoms.
