TITLE:
Quality of Life in Children With HIV Infection

CONDITION:
HIV Infections

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to characterize the quality of life (QOL) and longitudinal
      patterns of change in QOL outcomes in children and youth with HIV infection; to identify
      demographic, social, disease status, treatment, and health care utilization factors that
      predict longitudinal changes in outcomes; to develop a conceptual model that characterizes
      the effects of specific factors that predict longitudinal changes in QOL; and to
      characterize the influence of HIV symptoms on QOL outcomes in the domains of health
      perceptions, physical, psychological, and social role functioning.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      This is a Phase III study. This study will use national data available through a
      prospective, observational, longitudinal study of children and youth (n=1,993) from birth to
      25 with HIV infection (Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group Protocol 219/219C) to develop
      knowledge about the quality of life (QOL) and the factors that affect it in order to be able
      to implement effective nursing interventions and clinical programs to support and improve
      QOL in this vulnerable population of children.
