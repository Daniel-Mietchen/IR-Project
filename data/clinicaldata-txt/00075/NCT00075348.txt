TITLE:
Genetic Study to Identify Gene Mutations in Participants Previously Enrolled in Clinical Trial NCI-99-C-0053 Who Have Von Hippel-Lindau Syndrome or Are at Risk for Von Hippel-Lindau Syndrome

CONDITION:
Kidney Cancer

INTERVENTION:
mutation analysis

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: The identification of gene mutations in individuals who have or are at risk for
      von Hippel-Lindau syndrome may allow doctors to better determine the genetic processes
      involved in the development of cancer.

      PURPOSE: This genetic study is finding gene mutations in participants with von Hippel-Lindau
      syndrome or who are at risk for developing von Hippel-Lindau syndrome.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Obtain laboratory identification and confirmation of research results for gene
           mutations in participants previously enrolled in NCI-99-C-0053 who have von
           Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome or who are at risk for VHL syndrome.

        -  Determine genotype status in these participants.

      OUTLINE: Participants submit a blood or buccal sample for genetic mutation analysis.
      Participants may receive genetic counseling and/or the results of genetic testing, if
      desired.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 260 participants will be accrued for this study.
