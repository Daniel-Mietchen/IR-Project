TITLE:
Timing of Surgery and Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Advanced Ovarian Epithelial, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cavity Cancer

CONDITION:
Fallopian Tube Cancer

INTERVENTION:
carboplatin

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop tumor cells from
      dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving a chemotherapy drug before surgery may shrink
      the tumor so that it can be removed; giving chemotherapy after surgery may kill any
      remaining tumor cells. It is not yet known whether giving chemotherapy before and after
      surgery is more effective than giving chemotherapy after surgery in treating ovarian
      epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cavity cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II/III trial is studying how well giving chemotherapy before
      and after surgery works and compares it to giving chemotherapy after surgery alone in
      treating patients with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or
      primary peritoneal cavity cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the feasibility of a randomized trial to determine the impact of the timing
           of surgery and chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian
           epithelial, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, pilot, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (primary surgery): Patients undergo radical surgery. Within 6 weeks after primary
           surgery, patients receive chemotherapy comprising carboplatin alone or in combination
           with paclitaxel or another chemotherapy agent on day 1. Chemotherapy repeats every 3
           weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity. Patients may undergo interval debulking surgery after the third course of
           chemotherapy.

        -  Arm II (neoadjuvant chemotherapy): Patients receive chemotherapy as in arm I for 3
           courses. Within 3 weeks after chemotherapy, patients undergo radical surgery. Within 6
           weeks after surgery, patients receive an additional 3 courses of chemotherapy as in arm
           I.

      Patients are followed at 9 months after randomization, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6
      months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 100-150 patients will be accrued for this study within 18
      months.
