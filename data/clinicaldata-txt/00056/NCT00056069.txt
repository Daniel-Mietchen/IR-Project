TITLE:
Study of the Physical and Emotional Needs of Parents Caring for Children Receiving Chemotherapy for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia

CONDITION:
Leukemia

INTERVENTION:
questionnaire administration

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Studying the physical and emotional needs of parents who are caring for children
      receiving chemotherapy for cancer may help doctors plan effective treatments for the patient
      that allow for improved quality of life of the patient's family.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the different physical and emotional needs of
      parents whose children are undergoing chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia either
      in an outpatient clinic or in the hospital.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the caregiving demands reported by parents of children with acute lymphoblastic
           leukemia receiving methotrexate on 2 different infusion schedules (inpatient care vs
           outpatient care).

        -  Compare the change in caregiving demands on these parents over time, in terms of
           physical and emotional care, the need to make family arrangements, the need to
           communicate about the child's care, the need to gather information about the child's
           health status, and the effect on family well-being.

      OUTLINE: Participants complete questionnaires regarding caregiver demands and family
      information over 25-30 minutes within 3-4 months of the initiation of the child's treatment
      and at the completion of the first year of the child's treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 164 participants will be accrued for this study within 0.8
      years.
