TITLE:
Study of INS37217 Inhalation Solution in Mild to Moderate Cystic Fibrosis Lung Disease

CONDITION:
Cystic Fibrosis

INTERVENTION:
denufosol tetrasodium (INS37217)

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of multiple dosages of
      INS37217 compared to placebo over 28 days in subjects with mild to moderate cystic fibrosis
      (CF) lung disease. Study drug will be administered through a nebulizer (a device that
      delivers medication as a mist by breathing it in).
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      The purpose of this study is to:

        -  assess the safety and efficacy of multiple dose levels of INS37217 compared to placebo
           over 28 days in subjects with mild to moderate CF lung disease;

        -  explore evidence of activity of INS37217 and placebo administered via PARI LC STAR
           nebulizer;

        -  identify dose(s) that will be studied in subsequent trials.
