TITLE:
Study of a 6-Month Sustained-Release Formulation of Leuprolide Acetate in Prostate Cancer

CONDITION:
Prostatic Neoplasms

INTERVENTION:
Leuprolide acetate

SUMMARY:

      The primary purpose of the study is to determine if a new sustained-release 45 mg (depot)
      formulation of leuprolide acetate will reduce serum testosterone levels to and maintain them
      at medically castrate levels in subjects with prostatic adenocarcinoma.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      The primary purpose of the study is to determine if a new sustained-release 45 mg (depot)
      formulation of leuprolide acetate administered once every 26 weeks for 1 year, will lower
      testosterone levels to and maintain them at medically castrate levels in subjects with
      prostatic adenocarcinoma. This study will also evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of the
      45 mg formulation and assess the safety of this formulation.
