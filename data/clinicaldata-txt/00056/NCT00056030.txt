TITLE:
Combination Chemotherapy Plus Cetuximab in Treating Patients With Liver Metastases From Colorectal Cancer

CONDITION:
Colorectal Cancer

INTERVENTION:
cetuximab

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies such as cetuximab can locate tumor cells
      and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal
      cells. Combining chemotherapy with cetuximab may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving combination chemotherapy together
      with cetuximab works in treating patients with unresectable liver metastases from colorectal
      cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the surgical resectability rate of patients with unresectable hepatic
           metastases secondary to metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma treated with oxaliplatin,
           fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and cetuximab.

        -  Determine the response rate and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1 hour (over 2 hours on day 1 of course 1 only) on days 1
      and 8. Patients also receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours and leucovorin calcium IV over 2
      hours on day 1 and fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-2. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, for a minimum of 12 courses
      or until deemed to have resectable disease.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and prior to each treatment course.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 67-73 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.
