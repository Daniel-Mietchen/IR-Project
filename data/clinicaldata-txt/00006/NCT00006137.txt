TITLE:
Pilot Study of Enalapril and Renal Function in Patients With IgA Nephropathy

CONDITION:
IGA Glomerulonephritis

INTERVENTION:
enalapril

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the most sensitive outcome measures (functional or morphological)
      of a progressive renal injury in patients with IgA nephropathy.

      II. Determine which of these patients are destined to progress to further injury in order to
      target them for therapy.

      III. Elucidate the determinants of progression in those patients who exhibit evidence of
      either increasing impairment of ultrafiltration capacity or ongoing destruction of nephrons.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients receive oral enalapril daily. Treatment continues for 5 years in
      the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo renal function studies every 6-12 months for 5 years. Patients undergo
      renal biopsy at 36-48 months after study entry.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 13 Years to 60 Years
Criteria:

        Histologically confirmed IgA nephropathy, diagnosed within the past 3 years

        Clinical presentation of either isolated hematuria/proteinuria for less than 3 years OR

        Acute nephritic or nephrotic syndrome

        No secondary forms of IgA nephropathy associated with chronic inflammatory disease of the
        bowel and liver

        No end stage renal failure as defined by the following: Glomerular filtration rate less
        than 15 mL/min AND Extensive glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial damage

        No systemic lupus erythematosus or systemic (extrarenal) vasculitis (Henoch-Schonlein
        syndrome)

        Healthy volunteers will be accrued as a control group

        No other concurrent medical or psychiatric illness that would preclude study
