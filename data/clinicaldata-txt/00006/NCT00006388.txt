TITLE:
Radiation Therapy and Tamoxifen in Treating Adults With Newly Diagnosed Supratentorial Glioblastoma Multiforme

CONDITION:
Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors

INTERVENTION:
tamoxifen citrate

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs such as
      tamoxifen may make the tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining radiation therapy with
      tamoxifen in treating patients who have newly diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma
      multiforme.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether high-dose tamoxifen initiated at the beginning of
      conventional radiotherapy improves the median survival time of adults with newly diagnosed,
      supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme. II. Determine the feasibility and toxicity of
      high-dose tamoxifen in these patients. III. Determine the overall survival with respect to
      protein kinase C lab correlates in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Beginning within 5 weeks after surgery, patients
      undergo radiotherapy to the brain 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Patients receive high-dose oral
      tamoxifen every 6 hours beginning on day 1 of radiotherapy and continuing in the absence of
      disease progression. Patients are followed every 3 months through year 1, every 4 months for
      1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 72 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 months.
