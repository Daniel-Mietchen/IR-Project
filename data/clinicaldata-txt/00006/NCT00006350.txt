TITLE:
Mycophenolate Mofetil, Tacrolimus, Daclizumab, and Donor Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation in Treating Patients With Hematologic Cancer

CONDITION:
Leukemia

INTERVENTION:
daclizumab

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as daclizumab can locate tumor cells and either kill
      them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Peripheral
      stem cell transplantation from a brother or sister may be effective treatment for
      hematologic cancer. Sometimes the transplanted cells can be rejected by the body's tissue.
      Mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, and donor white blood cells may prevent this from
      happening.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus,
      daclizumab, and donor peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have
      hematologic cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether donor hematopoiesis can be safely established using a
      nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen followed by HLA matched sibling donor peripheral blood
      stem cell transplantation in patients with hematologic malignancies. II. Determine whether
      mixed chimerism can be safely converted to full donor hematopoiesis with this treatment
      regimen in these patients. III. Determine the toxicity and incidence of aplasia and graft
      versus host disease in these patients treated with this regimen. IV. Determine the antitumor
      potential of this treatment regimen in these patients. V. Determine the role of NFkB in the
      modulation of the cytokine secretion profile of T lymphocytes during an alloimmune response
      in these patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive immunosuppressive medications consisting of oral mycophenolate
      mofetil and tacrolimus twice a day beginning on day -8 and continuing through day 45 (in the
      absence of graft versus host disease). Patients also receive daclizumab IV over 30 minutes
      on days -1, 3, and 8. Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC)
      transplantation with donor CD34+ cells IV on day 0. If there is 0-80% donor hematopoiesis,
      patients receive donor lymphocyte infusions with CD3+ cells IV on days 75, 165, and 270.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-45 patients will be accrued for this study.

Criteria:

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Diagnosis of any of the following hematologic malignancies:
        Multiple myeloma Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Indolent OR Relapsed or primary refractory high
        grade or intermediate grade in complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) after
        salvage chemotherapy or autologous bone marrow transplantation Hodgkin's disease Relapsed
        or primary refractory in CR or PR after salvage chemotherapy or autologous bone marrow
        transplantation Chronic lymphocytic leukemia Chronic myeloid leukemia Myelodysplastic
        syndrome Acute myeloid leukemia with high risk CR1 or second or greater CR Acute
        lymphocytic leukemia with high risk CR1 or second or greater CR Must have a 6 antigen HLA
        identical sibling donor Must have one of the following conditions that confer an increased
        risk for undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation after myeloablative preparative
        regimen: Over 55 years of age AST or ALT greater than 2.5 times upper limit of normal
        (ULN) Bilirubin greater than 1.8 times ULN Renal dysfunction with creatinine greater than
        1.5 mg/dL (after 12 courses of prior cytotoxic therapy) Undergone one or more prior
        autologous bone marrow transplantations Refuse to undergo allogeneic bone marrow
        transplantation using a myeloablative preparative regimen A new classification scheme for
        adult non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ. The terminology of "indolent" or
        "aggressive" lymphoma will replace the former terminology of "low", "intermediate", or
        "high" grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses the former terminology.
