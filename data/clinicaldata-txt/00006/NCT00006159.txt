TITLE:
Family-Centered Diabetes Project

CONDITION:
Diabetes

INTERVENTION:
lifestyle (exercise, diet, and family and community support)

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this project is to determine whether a diabetes lifestyle program will
      improve the lives of Native American people living with diabetes. We recruited Native
      American people living in 8 Pueblo communities served by 3 Indian Health Service clinics.
      Forty percent of people living with diabetes in those communities participated in an
      interview and had height, weight, blood pressure and hemoglobin A1c measured at the
      beginning. Then they received a lifestyle program in either groups or one-on-one, or another
      group which got the intervention after one year (comparison group). The program was
      developed using input from community members, tribal leaders, and clinic staff, and was
      taught by community members in or near the participating communities. After each session,
      participants were asked for feedback about the curriculum. After the program ended, the
      interview and clinical measures were repeated. Feedback to tribal leaders and clinical staff
      is ongoing.
