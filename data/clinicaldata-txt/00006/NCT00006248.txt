TITLE:
S0007 - Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Recurrent Head and Neck Cancer

CONDITION:
Head and Neck Cancer

INTERVENTION:
cisplatin

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating
      patients who have metastatic or recurrent head and neck cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients with metastatic or recurrent squamous cell
           carcinoma of the head and neck treated with paclitaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil.

        -  Determine response (unconfirmed, confirmed, complete, and partial) and time to
           treatment failure in patients with measurable disease treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by cisplatin IV over 30
      minutes on day 1 and fluorouracil IV over 24 hours on days 1-4. Courses repeat every 21 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete
      response (CR) receive 3 additional courses beyond CR.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 65 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months.
