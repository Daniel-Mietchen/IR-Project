TITLE:
Arsenic Trioxide With or Without Tretinoin in Treating Patients With Hematologic Cancer That Has Not Responded to Previous Therapy

CONDITION:
Leukemia

INTERVENTION:
arsenic trioxide

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Tretinoin may help hematologic cancer cells develop into normal
      white blood cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of arsenic trioxide with or without
      tretinoin in treating patients who have hematologic cancer that has not responded to
      previous therapy.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      This is a dose escalation and efficacy study of arsenic trioxide. In the efficacy study,
      patients are stratified according to diagnosis (acute myelogenous leukemia vs acute
      lymphocytic leukemia vs myelodysplastic syndrome vs multiple myeloma vs non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma and Hodgkin's disease). Phase I: Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 2 hours
      daily for 28 days. Treatment repeats every 42-59 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve complete remission (CR) or partial remission
      (PR) receive up to 4 courses. Patients who fail to achieve CR or PR or who experience
      disease progression may receive arsenic trioxide and tretinoin daily for 28 days every 42-59
      days for up to 7 courses. Patients who fail to achieve CR or PR or experience disease
      progression with arsenic trioxide and tretinoin are removed from study. Cohorts of 3-6
      patients receive escalating doses of arsenic trioxide until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose limiting toxicities. Phase II: Patients receive the MTD of arsenic trioxide
      as in phase I for up to 7 courses. Patients who fail to achieve CR or PR after 3 courses or
      experience disease progression are either taken off study or treated with arsenic trioxide
      and tretinoin as in phase I. Patients are followed monthly for 6 months, and then every 3
      months for 18 months.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 15 Years to N/A
Criteria:

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Patients with any of the following diagnoses: Acute lymphocytic
        leukemia OR acute myeloid leukemia Failed to achieve complete remission (CR) with
        induction chemotherapy OR Relapsed within one year of initial CR OR Relapsed after
        autologous or allogeneic transplant OR Any subsequent relapse OR Refractory following
        relapse CR2 or more (phase I only) Blastic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia Prior
        therapy allowed Myelodysplastic syndrome, including the following: Refractory anemia with
        excess blasts (RAEB) OR RAEB in transformation (high intermediate or high risk only)
        Relapsed after transplant CR2 or more (phase I only) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma OR Hodgkin's
        disease Newly diagnosed or in first relapse and failed to achieve CR or partial remission
        after induction or salvage chemotherapy OR Second or later relapse OR Relapsed after
        transplant No disease that can be encompassed in a standard radiation port No
        asymptomatic, minimally symptomatic, or low grade lymphoma Multiple myeloma Symptomatic,
        progressive, or recurrent disease after treatment with alkylating agents, high dose
        corticosteroids, or anthracyclines OR Relapsed following transplant Not eligible for
        autologous or allogeneic transplant A new classification scheme for adult non-Hodgkin's
        lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ. The terminology of "indolent" or "aggressive" lymphoma
        will replace the former terminology of "low", "intermediate", or "high" grade lymphoma.
        However, this protocol uses the former terminology.
