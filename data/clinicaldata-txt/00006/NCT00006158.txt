TITLE:
AIDS Wasting in Women: Anabolic Effects of Testosterone

CONDITION:
AIDS Wasting Syndrome

INTERVENTION:
Testosterone

SUMMARY:

      The study is a 6 month, placebo-controlled study of transdermal testosterone for women with
      HIV-associated weight loss. Women with AIDS wasting have been found to have low testosterone
      levels. This study is designed to test the efficacy of physiologic testosterone dosing to
      improve weight, muscle mass and quality of life indices, including energy level, appetite
      and libido, in androgen deficient women with AIDS wasting. After 6 months, all women receive
      open label transdermal testosterone for an additional 6 months.
