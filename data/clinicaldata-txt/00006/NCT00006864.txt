TITLE:
Interleukin-2 in Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer

CONDITION:
Kidney Cancer

INTERVENTION:
aldesleukin

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill kidney cancer
      cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase IV trial to study the effectiveness of interleukin-2 in treating patients who
      have metastatic kidney cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the overall response rate, complete and partial response rates, and duration
           of response in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated with low-dose
           interleukin-2.

        -  Determine the overall survival, one-year progression-free survival, and two-year
           progression-free survival in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the incidence of adverse events in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive low-dose interleukin-2 subcutaneously 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Courses
      repeat every 9 weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 464 patients will be accrued for this study.
