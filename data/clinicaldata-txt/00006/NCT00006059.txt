TITLE:
Genetic Study of Familial Epilepsy

CONDITION:
Epilepsy

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the chromosomal regions that contain genes that raise the risk of epilepsy in
      families by performing genetic linkage analysis of idiopathic/cryptogenic epilepsy.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Family histories are obtained, then the patients undergo an interview, a
      neurological examination, and EEG. Blood specimens are also collected.

      Linkage analysis is performed on specimens and analysis of shared marker alleles are used to
      identify genomic regions likely or unlikely to contain the epilepsy genes. Genotypes in
      family members are determined at microsatellite markers throughout the genome. Markers
      tested include chromosomes linked to human epilepsy syndromes (6p, 8p, 8q, 20q, 21q) and
      chromosome 3 (similar to mouse "epilepsy" genes). Linkage to markers on chromosome 10q are
      also tested.

      Patients do not receive the results of the testing and the results do not influence the type
      and duration of any treatment.

        PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA:

        --Disease Characteristics--

        Male or female members of families with at least 1 close relative pair (sibling, half
        sibling, avuncular, grandparent-grandchild, or first cousin) affected with
        idiopathic/cryptogenic epilepsy that developed before age 25
