TITLE:
Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Ovarian Stromal Cancer

CONDITION:
Adult Type Ovarian Granulosa Cell Tumor

INTERVENTION:
Paclitaxel

SUMMARY:

      This phase II trial studies the effectiveness of paclitaxel in treating patients who have
      ovarian stromal cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells
      from dividing so they stop growing or die.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the probability of clinical response and toxicity of paclitaxel as
      second-line chemotherapy in measurable disease patients with malignant tumors of the ovarian
      stroma.

      II. To evaluate the value of inhibin for predicting response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment continues
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for three years, and
      then annually thereafter.
