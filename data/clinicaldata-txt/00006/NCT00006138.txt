TITLE:
Diagnostic Pilot Study of Dual Energy Absorptiometry in the Detection of Osteopenia or Osteoporosis in Patients With Thalassemia Major

CONDITION:
Osteoporosis

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the frequency and severity of osteopenia and osteoporosis in patients with
      thalassemia major who undergo dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, and correlate these findings
      with other relevant endocrinologic measurements.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo dual energy x-ray absorptiometry for bone density measurements, height
      (sitting and standing) and weight measurements, comprehensive endocrinologic examination,
      and assessment of the severity of iron overload at baseline, and then at years 1 and 2.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 6 Years to N/A
Criteria:

        -  Diagnosis of thalassemia major with iron overload

          -  Not pregnant

          -  Negative pregnancy test
