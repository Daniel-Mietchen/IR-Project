TITLE:
R115777 in Treating Patients With Advanced Bladder Cancer

CONDITION:
Bladder Cancer

INTERVENTION:
chemotherapy

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of R115777 in treating patients who have
      advanced bladder cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of R115777 in terms of objective response in patients
      with advanced transitional cell cancer of the urothelial tract. II. Determine the safety of
      this treatment regimen in these patients. III. Determine the time to disease progression in
      these patients with this treatment regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral R115777 every 12 hours for 21
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for at least 2 courses. Patients are followed every 3 months for up to 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-32 patients will be accrued for this study.
