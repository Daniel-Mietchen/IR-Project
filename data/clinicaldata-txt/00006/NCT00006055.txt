TITLE:
Autologous Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation in Patients With Life Threatening Autoimmune Diseases

CONDITION:
Purpura, Schoenlein-Henoch

INTERVENTION:
anti-thymocyte globulin

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether there is prompt engraftment after autologous peripheral
      blood stem cell transplantation using filgrastim (G-CSF) mobilization in patients with life
      threatening autoimmune diseases.

      II. Determine the kinetics of T- and B-cell immune reconstitution after a combination of
      timed plasmapheresis, high dose cyclophosphamide and total lymphoid irradiation, and
      posttransplant immunosuppression with cyclosporine in these patients.

      III. Determine whether this treatment regimen beneficially influences the clinical course of
      these patients.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) SC daily until peripheral blood stem
      cells (PBSC) are collected. On the fifth day of G-CSF therapy, PBSC are collected. Patients
      undergo plasmapheresis on days -9 to -7. Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on days -6 to
      -3 and total lymphoid irradiation on day -1. PBSC are reinfused on day 0. Following PBSC
      reinfusion, patients receive prophylaxis with oral prednisone or methylprednisolone IV on
      days -1 to 28, antithymocyte globulin IV on days 1-3, and cyclosporine every 12 hours on
      days 1-60.

      Patients with autoimmune thrombocytopenia purpura, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, or pure red
      cell aplasia are followed on days 7, 14, 21, 28, 60, and 100, 6 months, and 1, 2, and 5
      years. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, or systemic lupus
      erythematosus are followed on days 14, 28, 60, and 100, and then every 6 months. Patients
      with vasculitis are monitored for abnormal clinical and laboratory parameters characteristic
      of the individual type of vasculitis.
