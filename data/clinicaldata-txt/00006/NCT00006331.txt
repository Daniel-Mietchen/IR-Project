TITLE:
Prospective Controlled Study of Posttransplant Diabetes

CONDITION:
Diabetes Mellitus

INTERVENTION:
renal transplant

SUMMARY:

      Research participants will be asked to undergo complete medical history, physical
      examination and blood tests. The purpose of these tests is to determine whether persons are
      predisposed to develop diabetes mellitus after kidney transplantation and also to make an
      early diagnosis if a patient develops diabetes mellitus. Medical information collected as
      part of the standard transplant evaluation and posttransplant medical care may be
      incorporated into this study. It is important to realize that research subjects will not be
      given an experimental drug as part of this study.

      After kidney transplantation, research subjects will be followed in the posttransplant
      clinic visits. The study will last up to 6 months. During this time the subjects may be
      asked to participate in clinical assessment visits (medical history and physical
      examination), and also during the third or fourth month after transplant will be asked to do
      a repeat glucose tolerance test.
