TITLE:
Gemcitabine Plus Cisplatin in Treating Patients With Ovarian Epithelial Cancer or Primary Peritoneal Cancer That Is Recurrent or Has Not Responded to Platinum-based Chemotherapy

CONDITION:
Ovarian Cancer

INTERVENTION:
cisplatin

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of gemcitabine plus cisplatin in treating
      patients who have primary ovarian epithelial cancer or primary peritoneal cancer that is
      recurrent or has not responded to platinum-based chemotherapy.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the anti-tumor activity of gemcitabine and cisplatin in patients with
           recurrent or refractory platinum-resistant ovarian epithelial cancer or primary
           peritoneal carcinoma who have failed on higher priority treatment protocols.

        -  Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this regimen in this patient population.

        -  Correlate ex vivo drug sensitivity and resistance with clinical response to this
           regimen in these patients.

        -  Correlate molecular markers of drug responsiveness and cellular apoptosis with ex vivo
           measures of drug resistance in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour followed by gemcitabine IV over 1 hour on days 1
      and 8. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease
      progression.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-51 patients will be accrued for this study within 5-14
      months.
