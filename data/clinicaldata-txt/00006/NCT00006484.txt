TITLE:
Combination Chemotherapy With or Without Tirapazamine in Treating Patients With Stage IIIB or Stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer

CONDITION:
Lung Cancer

INTERVENTION:
carboplatin

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is
      not yet known which combination chemotherapy regimen is more effective for non-small cell
      lung cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of carboplatin plus
      paclitaxel with or without tirapazamine in treating patients who have stage IIIB or stage IV
      non-small cell lung cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the effects of paclitaxel and carboplatin with or without tirapazamine on
           progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with stage IV and selected
           stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer.

        -  Compare response rates in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to weight loss (less
      than 5% vs 5% or more), stage of disease (IIIB vs IV), and lactate dehydrogenase level
      (normal vs abnormal). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive tirapazamine IV over 2 hours followed by paclitaxel IV over 3
           hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel and carboplatin as in arm I. Treatment continues
           every 21 days for a total of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for one year, and then every 6 months for 2 years, or
      until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 500 patients (250 per arm) will be accrued for this study
      within 20 months.
