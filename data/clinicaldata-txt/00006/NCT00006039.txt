TITLE:
Interferon Alfa-2b in Treating Patients With Advanced Low-Grade Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma

CONDITION:
Lymphoma

INTERVENTION:
pegylated interferon alfa

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of the cancer cells and slow the
      growth of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of interferon alfa-2b in treating
      patients who have advanced low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response in patients with minimally treated or previously
      untreated advanced low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with pegylated interferon
      alfa-2b. II. Determine the effects of this treatment regimen on the immune system by
      measuring T-cell subsets and NK cells in this patient population. III. Determine event-free
      and progression-free survival in this patient population treated with this regimen. IV.
      Evaluate the toxicity profile of this treatment regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive pegylated interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously once weekly for 6
      months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Upon completion of
      treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for at least 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be initially accrued for this study.
      Additional patients will be accrued if acceptable responses are seen in the first cohort.

Criteria:

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed low-grade lymphoma including any of the
        following: REAL classification Follicular lymphoma (grade I or II) Lymphoplasmacytoid
        lymphoma Small lymphocytic lymphoma Marginal B-cell lymphoma MALT lymphoma International
        Working Formulation Follicular small cleaved cell lymphoma Follicular mixed small and
        large cell lymphoma Small lymphocytic lymphoma No intermediate or high-grade non-Hodgkin's
        lymphoma (NHL) histology No evidence of histologic transformation If previously untreated,
        large tumor burden including any of the following: Nodal or extranodal mass greater than 7
        cm in diameter Involvement of at least 3 nodal sites (each greater than 3 cm in diameter)
        Systemic symptoms Splenomegaly Ureteral compression Intraabdominal stage II, stage III, or
        stage IV disease Measurable disease No prior systemic therapy OR No more than 1 prior
        therapy ( e.g., chemotherapy, immunotherapy, chemotherapy with immunotherapy, or
        chemotherapy with regional radiotherapy) A new classification scheme for adult
        non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ. The terminology of "indolent" or
        "aggressive" lymphoma will replace the former terminology of "low", "intermediate", or
        "high" grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses the former terminology.
