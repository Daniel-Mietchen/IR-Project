TITLE:
Behavioral Treatment of Weight Gain in CF

CONDITION:
Cystic Fibrosis

INTERVENTION:
Behavioral Treatment

SUMMARY:

      The current study examines the efficacy of two treatments to help children with cystic
      fibrosis (CF) meet their dietary calorie requirements of 120% to 150% of the recommended
      daily allowance of energy and the effect of these treatments on weight gain and maintenance.
      One treatment provides children with CF and their parents nutrition education about the best
      foods for meeting their dietary needs. The second treatment gives children with CF and their
      families similar nutritional information plus behavioral parenting methods for motivating
      children to eat the recommended foods. Children with CF and their families are seen weekly
      for 7 treatment sessions across 9 weeks for the active phase of treatment. Families are then
      followed for 2 years after treatment in order to better understand how long the treatments
      are effective and to determine the health benefits of better nutrition status and weight
      gain.
