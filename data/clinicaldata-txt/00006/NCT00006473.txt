TITLE:
Oxaliplatin in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma

CONDITION:
Angioimmunoblastic T-cell Lymphoma

INTERVENTION:
oxaliplatin

SUMMARY:

      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of oxaliplatin in treating patients who have
      relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways
      to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the response rate to oxaliplatin in patients with relapsed or refractory
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      II. Determine the treatment-related toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to histologic
      subtype (indolent vs aggressive).

      Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for a
      maximum of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 72 patients will be accrued for this study within 2-3 years.
