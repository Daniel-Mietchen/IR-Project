TITLE:
The Safety and Efficacy of an Investigational Drug in Delaying the Progression of Alzheimer's Disease

CONDITION:
Alzheimer Disease

INTERVENTION:
Investigational drug

SUMMARY:

      This is a 15-month study with two phases. During the first 12-month phase of this study,
      patients will be randomly assigned to receive either active study drug or placebo
      (approximately half of all patients will be on active study drug, the other half on
      placebo). The second phase is a 3-month randomized withdrawal period. For this phase
      approximately 10% of the patients will remain on the active drug.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      This is a placebo-controlled, parallel-groups, 12 month, double-blind study, followed by a
      3-month, double-blind, randomized withdrawal period to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      an investigational drug (currently approved for other indications) to slow the progression
      of symptoms of AD. Patients with probable AD according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria who have a
      Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score between 13 and 26 inclusive will be eligible for
      participation in the study.

      Patients on stable doses of marketed cholinesterase inhibitors approved for the treatment of
      AD (except for tacrine) for at least 3 months are eligible for study entry. Use of NSAIDs
      (except aspirin 81 mg per day) is not allowed during the study.
