TITLE:
Rebeccamycin Analogue in Treating Children With Solid Tumors or Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma

CONDITION:
Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors

INTERVENTION:
becatecarin

SUMMARY:

      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of rebeccamycin analogue in treating children who
      have solid tumors or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways
      to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the response in children with solid tumors or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated
      with rebeccamycin analogue.

      II. Determine and maintain a plasma concentration of at least 5 g/mL of this drug in these
      patients.

      III. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. IV. Determine the
      pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients with solid tumors are stratified according to tumor histology (neuroblastoma vs
      Ewing's sarcoma [closed to accrual as of 5/19/03]/peripheral primative neuroectodermal tumor
      [PNET] vs osteosarcoma [closed to accrual as of 5/19/03] vs rhabdomyosarcoma vs
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma vs other solid tumors). Patients with CNS tumors are stratified
      according to tumor histology (medulloblastoma/PNET vs ependymoma vs brainstem glioma vs
      other CNS tumors).

      Patients receive rebeccamycin analogue IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment continues every 21
      days for a total of 16 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients are followed monthly for 1 year, every 2 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 1
      year, and then annually thereafter.
