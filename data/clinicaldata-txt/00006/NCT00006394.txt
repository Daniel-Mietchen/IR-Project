TITLE:
Randomized Study of Growth Hormone on Bone Mineral Density in Patients With Adult Onset Growth Hormone Deficiency

CONDITION:
Osteoporosis

INTERVENTION:
growth hormone

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare whether the bone tissue in the spine and hip improves in patients
      with adult onset growth hormone deficiency treated with growth hormone (GH) vs placebo.

      II. Determine whether the blood samples of these patients show evidence of beneficial bone
      effects after treatment with GH.

      III. Compare the quality of life of these patients treated with these 2 regimens.

      IV. Determine the side effects of GH in these patients.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study.
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive growth hormone subcutaneously (SC) daily for 2 years. Arm II:
      Patients receive placebo SC daily for 2 years. Quality of life is assessed at the initial
      eligibility screening, then again within 1 month after the initial screening, and then at 1,
      3, and 6 months during study therapy.

Age: 18 Years to N/A
