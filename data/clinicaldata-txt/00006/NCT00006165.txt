TITLE:
Native Hawaiian Diabetes Intervention Program

CONDITION:
Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2

INTERVENTION:
'Ohana (Family) Support Lifestyle Intervention

SUMMARY:

      The Native Hawaiian Diabetes Intervention Program is a project focused on determining
      whether a cultural-based, healthy lifestyles program with family support will have a
      positive effect on lifestyle behaviors and psychosocial and clinical outcomes. A culturally
      sensitive, lifestyle intervention program was administered via community peer educators to a
      population of Native Hawaiians with or at risk for diabetes. The effect of this intervention
      program on selected outcomes is being compared to a ''standard'' program given to a similar
      population in a second Native Hawaiian community.
