TITLE:
S0010 506U78 in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia

CONDITION:
Leukemia

INTERVENTION:
nelarabine

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of 506U78 in treating patients who have
      recurrent or refractory acute lymphocytic leukemia.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Assess the complete remission rate in patients with recurrent or refractory non-T-cell
           acute lymphocytic leukemia when treated with 506U78.

        -  Determine the frequency and severity of toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive 506U78 IV over 2 hours on days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment continues every 21
      days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every month for 6 months, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6
      months for 3.5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 18
      months.
