TITLE:
Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Gene Polymorphism and the Risk of Chronic Allograft Nephropathy

CONDITION:
Kidney Disease

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      This study is intended to help doctors learn about the relationships between specific
      genetic makeup (gene markers) and the development of chronic rejection. This study is being
      done to see if there is a relationship between genetic patterns and the development of
      Chronic Allograft Nephropathy (CAN). Medical scientists also hope to learn more about how
      genetic differences between people determine their response to a drug or a disease by
      storing a small blood sample in a special "bank". This sample may be tested at some point in
      the future in an attempt to better understand the factors that may influence rejection,
      transplantation outcomes and transplant success rates.
