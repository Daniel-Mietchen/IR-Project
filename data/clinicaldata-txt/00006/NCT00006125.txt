TITLE:
Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Intermediate-Grade or High-Grade Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma

CONDITION:
Lymphoma

INTERVENTION:
doxorubicin hydrochloride

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining doxorubicin and topotecan in
      treating patients who have relapsed or refractory intermediate-grade or high-grade
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the response rate and time to progression in patients with relapsed or
           refractory intermediate or high grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with doxorubicin
           and topotecan.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive doxorubicin IV over 5-10 minutes on day 1 and topotecan IV over 30
      minutes on days 3-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and annually for the next 3 years.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Histologically confirmed recurrent or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of one of the
             following subtypes:

               -  Follicular center lymphoma, grade 3

               -  Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma

               -  Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma

               -  Burkitt's lymphoma

               -  High grade B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt-like

               -  Anaplastic large cell lymphoma, CD30+ cell type

               -  Anaplastic large cell lymphoma, T-cell type

               -  Anaplastic large cell lymphoma, null-cell type

               -  Anaplastic large cell lymphoma, Hodgkin's like

          -  Bidimensionally measurable disease NOTE: A new classification scheme for adult
             non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ. The terminology of "indolent" or
             "aggressive" lymphoma will replace the former terminology of "low", "intermediate",
             or "high" grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses the former terminology.
