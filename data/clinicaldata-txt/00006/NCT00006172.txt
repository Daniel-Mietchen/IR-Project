TITLE:
Clinical Trials of Two Non-drug Treatments for Chronic Depression

CONDITION:
Mood Disorders

INTERVENTION:
Bright light box

SUMMARY:

      This study investigates the potential efficacy of two nonpharmacologic treatments for
      nonseasonal depression, bright light exposure or high-density negative air ion exposure.
      Treatments are self-administered at home by the patient under close clinical supervision.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Bright light exposure and high-density negative ion exposure have been designed to mimic
      outdoor environmental conditions and are effective in relieving symptoms of seasonal
      (winter) depression, but their effectiveness in treating chronic depression has not been
      explored.

      Participants in this 10-week study will have an interview, a complete physical exam, and six
      one-hour appointments for progress evaluations. They will be randomly assigned to either
      light or high- or low-dose negative ions. Each treatment must be taken consistently for five
      weeks at the same time every day, after which treatment is temporarily suspended to
      determine whether symptoms return. Participants will then have the opportunity to try the
      alternate active treatment to determine which works best for them. On two occasions,
      participants will provide saliva samples, used to determine the level of melatonin, a
      hormone that becomes active at night and indicates whether a person's internal circadian
      clock is "in sync" with the day-night cycle or is early or late. This diagnostic test for
      melatonin, which is not yet readily available in medical practice, provides our research
      participants with unique information that can be used to optimize the timing of future
      treatment.
