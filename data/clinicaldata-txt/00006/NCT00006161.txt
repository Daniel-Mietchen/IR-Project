TITLE:
Decompression Intervention of Variceal Rebleeding Trial (DIVERT)

CONDITION:
Esophageal and Gastric Varices

INTERVENTION:
Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS)

SUMMARY:

      The Decompression Intervention of Variceal Rebleeding Trial (DIVERT) is a multi-center
      prospective randomized clinical trial comparing the radiologic procedure of transjugular
      intrahepatic portal-systemic shunt (TIPS) with the surgical procedure of distal splenorenal
      shunt (DSRS) for variceal bleeding in patients with Child's Class A and B cirrhosis.

      This is recognized nationally and internationally as the study that will answer the question
      as to which of these is the best treatment for decompression of varices in patients who have
      failed endoscopic and pharmacologic therapy.
