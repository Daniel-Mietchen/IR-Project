TITLE:
Combination Chemotherapy Plus Bevacizumab in Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer

CONDITION:
Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate

INTERVENTION:
estramustine phosphate sodium

SUMMARY:

      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus monoclonal
      antibody therapy in treating patients who have metastatic prostate cancer that has not
      responded to previous hormone therapy. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop
      tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies such as
      bevacizumab may stop the growth of cancer cells by stopping blood flow to the tumor.
      Combining monoclonal antibody therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine time to objective progression, response rate (objective and PSA response)
      and duration of response in men with hormone refractory prostate cancer treated with
      estramustine, docetaxel and bevacizumab.

      II. To determine the toxicity of this regimen in men with hormone refractory prostate
      cancer.

      III. To study the relationship of baseline VEGF levels in urine and plasma and changes in
      these levels to response and duration of response to treatment with bevacizumab, docetaxel
      and estramustine.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive oral estramustine 3 times daily on days 1-5 and docetaxel IV over 1 hour
      followed by bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 2. Treatment repeats every 21 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at least every 3 months for 2 years.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: Male
Age: N/A to N/A
Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically documented adenocarcinoma of the prostate with
             progressive systemic (metastatic) disease despite castrate levels of testosterone due
             to orchiectomy or LHRH agonist (which must be continued); castrate levels of
             testosterone must be maintained

          -  At the time of enrollment, patients must have evidence of metastatic disease, either:

               -  Measurable disease (with any PSA) OR

               -  Non-measurable disease with PSA >= 5 ng/ml; patients with PSA >= 5 ng/ml only
                  are not eligible DEFINITION OF MEASURABLE DISEASE/TARGET LESIONS

               -  Any lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest
                  diameter to be recorded) as >= 20 mm with conventional techniques: 1) physical
                  exam for clinically palpable lymph nodes and superficial skin lesions, 2) chest
                  X-ray for clearly defined lung lesions surrounded by aerated lung OR those
                  lesions measured as >= 10 mm with a spiral CT scan or MRI

               -  Measurable lesions (up to a maximum of 10 in number) representative of all
                  organs involved to be identified as target lesions; the sum of the longest
                  diameters (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as
                  baseline sum LD

                    -  If measurable disease is confined to a solitary lesion then its neoplastic
                       nature will need to be confirmed by histology

                    -  Ultrasound may not be used to measure tumor lesions that are not easily
                       accessible clinically DEFINITION OF NON-MEASURABLE DISEASE/NON-TARGET
                       LESIONS

               -  Non-target lesions include all other lesions, including small lesions with
                  longest diameter < 20 mm with conventional techniques or < 10 mm with spiral CT
                  scan and truly non-measurable lesions, which include:

                    -  Bone lesions

                    -  Pleural or pericardial effusions, ascites

                    -  CNS lesions, leptomeningeal disease

                    -  Irradiated lesions, unless progression documented after RT

          -  Patients must have demonstrated evidence of progressive disease since the most recent
             change in therapy; progressive disease is defined as any one of the following
             (measurable disease, bone scan, or PSA progression):

               -  MEASURABLE DISEASE PROGRESSION: Objective evidence of increase > 20% in the sum
                  of the longest diameters (LD) of target lesions from the time of maximal
                  regression or the appearance of one or more new lesions

               -  BONE SCAN PROGRESSION: Appearance of one or more new lesions on bone scan
                  attributable to prostate cancer along with a PSA >= 5 ng/ml will constitute
                  progression

               -  PSA PROGRESSION: An elevated PSA (at least >= 5 ng/ml) which has risen serially
                  from baseline on two occasions each at least one week apart. If the confirmatory
                  PSA (#3) value is less (i.e., #3b) than screening PSA (#2) value, then an
                  additional test for rising PSA (#4) will be required to document progression

          -  Failure despite standard androgen deprivation therapy

          -  Flutamide and megestrol acetate (any dose) must be discontinued at least 4 weeks
             prior to registration; bicalutamide and nilutamide must be discontinued at least 6
             weeks prior to registration. If improvement following antiandrogen withdrawal is
             noted, progression must be established using the criteria above; primary testicular
             androgen suppression (e.g., with an LHRH analogue) should not be discontinued

          -  At least 4 weeks since any hormonal therapy, including ketoconazole,
             aminoglutethimide, systemic steroids (any dose), megestrol acetate (any dose)

          -  No prior cytotoxic chemotherapy, including estramustine or suramin

          -  No prior anti-angiogenesis agents, including thalidomide and bevacizumab

          -  >= 4 weeks since major surgery and fully recovered

          -  >= 4 weeks since any prior radiation and fully recovered

          -  >= 8 weeks since the last dose of strontium-89 or Samarium

          -  Patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy prior to initiating protocol treatment must
             have received bisphosphonates for at least 1 month and have progressive disease
             despite this therapy

          -  CTC (ECOG) performance status: 0-2

          -  No myocardial infarction or significant change in anginal pattern within one year or
             current congestive heart failure (NYHA Class 2 or higher)

          -  No deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolus within one year. No need for full-dose
             oral or parenteral anticoagulation; daily prophylactic aspirin is allowed

          -  No clinically significant peripheral neuropathy

          -  Granulocytes >= 1500/ul

          -  Platelet count >= 100,000/ul

          -  Creatinine =< 1.5 x upper limit of normal

          -  Bilirubin =< 1.0 x upper limit of normal

          -  AST =< 1.5 x upper limits of normal

          -  Urinalysis =< 1 + protein on dipstick

          -  PSA >= 5 ng/ml (if non-measurable disease)
