TITLE:
Exemestane in Treating Postmenopausal Women With Resected Stage I, Stage II, or Stage IIIA Breast Cancer Who Have Completed 5 Years of Tamoxifen

CONDITION:
Breast Cancer

INTERVENTION:
exemestane

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Estrogen can stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using
      exemestane may fight breast cancer by reducing the production of estrogen by the tumor
      cells. It is not yet known whether exemestane is effective in preventing the recurrence of
      breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to study the effectiveness of exemestane in preventing
      cancer recurrence in postmenopausal women who have resected stage I, stage II, or stage IIIA
      breast cancer and have completed 5 years of tamoxifen.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine whether the administration of 5 years of exemestane after 5 years of
           tamoxifen therapy is more effective than 5 years of prior tamoxifen therapy alone in
           prolonging disease-free survival, overall survival, and time to treatment failure in
           postmenopausal women with resected stage I, II, or IIIA breast cancer.

        -  Determine the effect of tamoxifen withdrawal on bone, in terms of height, fractures,
           and total alkaline phosphatase in these patients and on bone mineral density and bone
           biochemical markers in a subset of patients.

        -  Determine the effect of exemestane on bone loss after tamoxifen withdrawal in these
           patients.

        -  Evaluate the quality of life of a subset of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral exemestane daily for 5 years.

        -  Arm II (closed as of 10/15/03): Patients receive an oral placebo daily for 5 years.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then every 6 months for 5.5 years.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 6 years and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3,000 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years
      and 4 months.
