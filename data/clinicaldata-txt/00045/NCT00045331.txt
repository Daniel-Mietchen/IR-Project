TITLE:
Study in Predicting Outcome of Patients Undergoing Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer

CONDITION:
Prostate Cancer

INTERVENTION:
proteomic profiling

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Proteins found in blood and urine samples may help predict outcome and allow
      doctors to plan more effective treatment.

      PURPOSE: Diagnostic trial to study blood and urine proteins in predicting treatment outcome
      in patients who are undergoing radiation therapy for prostate cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Correlate serum and urine protein profiles collected before or after radiotherapy with
           clinical outcome in patients with prostate cancer.

        -  Identify protein profiles that can distinguish between patients with no evidence of
           disease and those with biochemical and/or clinical failure.

        -  Determine whether those serum proteomic profiles consistent with failure can be
           identified at early time points in the course of treatment and follow-up of these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to clinical outcome (prior to radiotherapy vs no
      evidence of disease vs biochemical failure vs clinical failure vs clinical outcome not yet
      determined).

      Urine and blood specimens are collected from patients either before or after definitive
      radiotherapy. Samples are analyzed by surface-enhanced laser desorption and ionization
      time-of-flight mass spectrometry to develop proteomic patterns.

      Results of proteomic profiles do not influence patient care.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 150 patients (30 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.
