TITLE:
A Phase II Study Of The Farnesyltransferase Inhibitor ZANESTRA (R115777, NSC #702818, IND #58,359) In Complete Remission Following Induction And/Or Consolidation Chemotherapy In Adults With Poor-Risk Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) And High-Risk Myelodysplasia (MDS)

CONDITION:
Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Remission

INTERVENTION:
tipifarnib

SUMMARY:

      Tipifarnib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their
      growth. Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of tipifarnib in treating patients who
      have acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome in first complete remission
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the duration of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) when
      ZARNESTRA is administered after intensive induction and consolidation chemotherapy to adults
      with poor risk acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or high-risk myelodysplasia (MDS) in first
      complete remission (CR).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the tolerability and toxicities of ZARNESTRA when administered in a chronic
      dosing schedule over a 48 week period to adults in first CR following intensive cytotoxic
      chemotherapies.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days
      for up to 16 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-44 patients will be accrued for this study within 11-15
      months.
