TITLE:
Proleukin in Combination With Rituxan in Patients With Low-Grade Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Who Have Previously Failed Rituxan Treatments

CONDITION:
Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin

INTERVENTION:
Recombinant Human Interleukin-2 and Rituximab

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of combination

Age: 18 Years to N/A
Criteria:

        Diagnosis and disease status:

          -  Subjects with CD20+, B-cell, Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of low-grade or follicular
