TITLE:
Combination Bisphosphonate and Anti-Angiogenesis Therapy With Pamidronate and Thalidomide

CONDITION:
Multiple Myeloma

INTERVENTION:
Pamidronate

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this research is to study how helpful the combination of thalidomide and
      Pamidronate or thalidomide and Zometa is in controlling the myeloma disease and to study any
      side effects.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Recently laboratory research found that thalidomide can inhibit the formation of new blood
      vessels that are necessary for the growth and spread of cancer. In order to grow and
      increase in size tumors require new blood vessels to supply them with the necessary blood to
      grow. If we can prevent these new blood vessels feeding the tumor from being formed by using
      thalidomide we might slow or stop the growth of the tumor. This concept is called
      "anti-angiogenesis" It is hoped that thalidomide will slow or stop the growth myeloma.
      However, it cannot be guaranteed that you will benefit if you take part in this study. The
      treatment you receive may even be harmful.
