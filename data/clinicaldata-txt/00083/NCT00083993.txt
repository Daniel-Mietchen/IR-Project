TITLE:
Study Evaluating CCI-779 and Letrozole in Post-menopausal Women With Breast Cancer

CONDITION:
Breast Neoplasms

INTERVENTION:
Temsirolimus (CCI-779) for 34 months

SUMMARY:

      In this clinical research study, postmenopausal subjects with metastatic breast cancer will
      be given either the combination of temsirolimus (CCI-779) and letrozole or a placebo and
      letrozole in first-line hormonal treatment. The primary endpoint of this study is to
      determine overall progression free survival.

      Individual subjects will participate in the active treatment phase of the study until
      disease progression or withdrawal of consent, provided that test article is being tolerated.
      All subjects will be asked to participate in the long-term follow-up phase of the study,
      which includes follow-up every 3 months until disease progression (for subjects who withdraw
      for reasons other than documented progressive disease) or until any new cancer treatment is
      received, and for survival. The estimated duration of study participation is 34 months.
