TITLE:
Intravenous VEGF Trap in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Advanced Solid Tumors or Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma

CONDITION:
Cancer

INTERVENTION:
ziv-aflibercept

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: VEGF Trap may stop the growth of solid tumors or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma by
      stopping blood flow to the tumor.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of intravenous VEGF
      Trap in treating patients with relapsed or refractory advanced solid tumors or non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of intravenous VEGF Trap in patients with
           relapsed or refractory advanced solid tumors or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated intravenous dose of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the ability of this drug to bind circulating vascular endothelial growth
           factor in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the ability of this drug to alter tumor blood flow and tumor
           vascular permeability in these patients.

        -  Determine whether antibodies to this drug develop in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive VEGF Trap IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 15 for a total of 2 doses.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of VEGF Trap until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, an additional 6
      patients are treated at that dose level.

      In the absence of dose-limiting toxicity, patients with stable disease or partial or
      complete remission may continue to receive VEGF Trap on a separate extension protocol.

      Patients are followed at weeks 1, 3, and 7 and then at 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 25 patients will be accrued for this study.
