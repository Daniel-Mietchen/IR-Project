TITLE:
Caspofungin for the Treatment of Non-blood Candida Infections (0991-045)

CONDITION:
Candidiasis

INTERVENTION:
MK0991, caspofungin acetate/Duration of Treatment: variable

SUMMARY:

      Candida is the most common fungal pathogen identified in hospitalized patients. This study
      will seek to enroll adult patients (18 years of age or older) with invasive Candida
      infections (involving deep tissues and organs). The study will not enroll patients whose
      only site of Candida infection was the bloodstream. Patients that fulfill all study entry
      criteria will receive a single daily dose of caspofungin. Caspofungin, an intravenous
      echinocandin antifungal agent, is already approved for the treatment of invasive
      candidiasis. The dosage strength and duration of caspofungin will be individualized for each
      patient based on disease, severity of disease and extent of infection.
