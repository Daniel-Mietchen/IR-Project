TITLE:
Efficacy/Safety of Ecraprost in Lipid Emulsion for Treatment of Critical Leg Ischemia Due to Peripheral Arterial Disease

CONDITION:
Peripheral Vascular Disease

INTERVENTION:
Ecraprost in lipid emulsion

SUMMARY:

      Ecraprost in lipid emulsion is being developed for the treatment of Critical leg ischemia
      (CLI), which is the most severe form of peripheral arterial disease (PAD); This trial is
      designed to assess the efficacy and safety of the drug in the treatment of CLI.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
NONE

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 40 Years to N/A
Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Critical leg ischemia (CLI) defined as distal extremity pain at rest, or peripheral
             ischemic ulcer(s), with severe hemodynamic impairment as diagnosed by ankle systolic
             pressure, toe systolic pressure or TcPO2

          -  Subjects will already be scheduled to receive a revascularization procedure (e.g.,
             by-pass graft, endovascular procedure, etc.) involving a distal target artery below
             the knee joint (e.g., below the knee joint popliteal, anterior/posterior tibial,
             peroneal, plantar, pedal, etc.) as part of their normal standard of care.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a previous major amputation (at or above ankle)

          -  Subjects with end stage renal disease (ESRD) defined as significant renal dysfunction
             evidenced by estimated creatinine clearance of < 20 cc/min, or receiving chronic
             hemodialysis therapy.
