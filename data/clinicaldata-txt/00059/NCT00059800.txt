TITLE:
Boron Neutron Capture Therapy in Treating Patients With Melanoma

CONDITION:
Melanoma (Skin)

INTERVENTION:
boron neutron capture therapy

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Boron neutron capture therapy may selectively kill tumor cells without harming
      normal tissue.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of boron neutron capture therapy in
      treating patients who have melanoma.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the clinical response, by serial objective measurements, in patients with
           melanoma treated with boron neutron capture therapy.

        -  Determine the time course, uniformity, and severity of acute dermal reactions in
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the late dermal reactions in patients who are followed for at least 6 months
           after treatment with this regimen.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to tumor size (no greater than 15 cc vs greater
      than 15 cc).

      Patients undergo boron neutron capture therapy.

      Patients are followed for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
