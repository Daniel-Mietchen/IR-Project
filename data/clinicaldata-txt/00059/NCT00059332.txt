TITLE:
Field Administration of Stroke Therapy - Magnesium (FAST-MAG) Trial

CONDITION:
Cerebrovascular Accident

INTERVENTION:
Magnesium Sulfate

SUMMARY:

      The goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of field-initiated
      magnesium sulfate in improving the long-term functional outcome of patients with acute
      stroke.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the leading cause of adult disability in the
      United States. Each year, more than 750,000 Americans suffer a symptomatic stroke.

      Currently, tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is the only approved treatment for acute
      ischemic stroke; however, its usefulness is limited because most patients cannot reach
      medical attention within the necessary 3-hour time window. In addition, rt-PA cannot be
      given in the field because it is contraindicated for treatment of patients with brain
      hemorrhage.

      The purpose of this multi-center, randomized, double-blind trial is to demonstrate that
      paramedic initiation of the neuroprotective agent magnesium sulfate in the field is an
      effective and safe treatment for acute stroke. This study will analyze magnesium sulfate, an
      experimental therapy for stroke, versus placebo among ambulance-transported patients with
      acute stroke. This trial will also demonstrate that paramedics can safely, effectively, and
      rapidly start neuroprotective therapies for stroke.
