TITLE:
Role of Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) in Development of Necrotizing Enterocolitis

CONDITION:
Necrotizing Enterocolitis

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious gastrointestinal disorder that primarily
      affects preterm infants. About 10% of babies less than 32 weeks gestation at birth will
      develop it. Overall, 30% of babies who develop NEC will die from it, with many others
      developing long term gastrointestinal problems. The most important factor in its development
      is a premature intestinal tract. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is an important growth factor
      in the development and maintenance of the gastrointestinal tract. This study will look for a
      relationship between EGF levels in premature babies and the development of NEC.
