TITLE:
MDX-060 Monoclonal Antibody in Treating Patients With Refractory or Relapsed Lymphoma

CONDITION:
Lymphoma

INTERVENTION:
iratumumab

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as MDX-060 can locate cancer cells and either kill
      them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of MDX-060 monoclonal antibody in
      treating patients who have refractory or relapsed lymphoma.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of MDX-060 monoclonal antibody in patients with
           refractory or relapsed CD30-positive lymphoma.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of this drug in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the efficacy (antilymphoma activity) of this drug in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive MDX-060 monoclonal antibody IV over 90 minutes once weekly for 4 weeks.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of MDX-060 monoclonal antibody until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is
      determined, an additional 16 patients are accrued and receive MDX-060 monoclonal antibody at
      the MTD.

      Patients are followed monthly for 3 months and then every 3 months for 18 months or until
      disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
