TITLE:
Efficacy/Safety of Ecraprost in Lipid Emulsion for Treatment of Critical Leg Ischemia Due to Peripheral Arterial Disease

CONDITION:
Peripheral Vascular Disease

INTERVENTION:
Ecraprost in lipid emulsion

SUMMARY:

      Ecraprost in lipid emulsion is being developed for the treatment of Critical leg ischemia
      (CLI), which is the most severe form of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). This trial is
      designed to assess the efficacy and safety of the drug in the treatment of CLI.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
NONE

Gender: All
Age: 40 Years to N/A
Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Critical leg ischemia (CLI) defined as distal extremity pain at rest, or peripheral
             ischemic ulcer(s), with severe hemodynamic impairment as diagnosed by ankle systolic
             pressure, toe systolic pressure or TcPO2

          -  The subject has exhausted all standard revascularization treatment options at this
             time.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a previous major amputation (at or above ankle)

          -  Subjects with end stage renal disease (ESRD) defined as significant renal dysfunction
             evidenced by estimated creatinine clearance of < 20 cc/min, or receiving chronic
             hemodialysis therapy.
