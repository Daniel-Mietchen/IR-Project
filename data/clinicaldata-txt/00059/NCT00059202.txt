TITLE:
Trial of High-dose Urso in Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis

CONDITION:
Sclerosing Cholangitis

INTERVENTION:
Ursodeoxycholic Acid

SUMMARY:

      This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial of high dose ursodiol versus placebo for
      patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). The average duration of follow-up will
      be approximately five years with important clinical endpoints such as death, eligibility for
      liver transplantation, changes in histology and cholangiogram as well as liver
      biochemistries and quality of life data collected.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
NONE

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 18 Years to 75 Years
Criteria:

        -  Chronic cholestatic disease of at least six months' duration.

          -  Serum alkaline phosphatase at least 1  times the upper limits of normal.

          -  Retrograde, operative, percutaneous, or magnetic resonance cholangiography
             demonstrating intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic biliary duct obstruction, beading, or
             narrowing consistent with PSC within one year of the study entry.

          -  Liver biopsy in the previous one year which is available for review and compatible
             with the diagnosis of PSC. Compatible biopsy features include fibrous cholangitis,
             ductopenia with periportal inflammation and biliary fibrosis.
