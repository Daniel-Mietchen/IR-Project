TITLE:
A Trial of CS-747 (Prasugrel) Compared With Clopidogrel in Patients Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI)

CONDITION:
Cardiovascular Diseases

INTERVENTION:
Prasugrel (CS-747)

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a drug known as CS-747 (also known
      as prasugrel) on subjects having a procedure called a percutaneous coronary intervention
      (also referred to as PCI) in which a doctor will attempt to open a blocked vessel (or
      vessels) in the heart using a catheter (a long thin tube) that has a small balloon on the
      end. In many cases, patients who have this procedure receive a stent, a small wire spring
      that helps keep the vessel open.
