TITLE:
Effects of St. John's Wort on the Effectiveness of Oral Contraceptives

CONDITION:
Contraception

INTERVENTION:
hypericum perforatum

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a common herbal remedy, St. John's
      Wort, on the effectiveness of birth control pills. St. John's Wort has recently been shown
      to increase metabolism of some drugs. If it could increase metabolism of oral contraceptives
      as well, it may increase the risk of contraceptive failure and unintended pregnancy. Study
      participants will be evaluated for risk of ovulation on oral contraceptives before and
      during simultaneous therapy with St. John's Wort.
