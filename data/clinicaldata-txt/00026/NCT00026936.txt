TITLE:
A Pilot Study to Investigate the Clinical Utility of the Peregrine Monte Carlo Dose Calculation System for Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning

CONDITION:
Neoplasm

INTERVENTION:
Radiotherapy

SUMMARY:

      The utility of PEREGRINE Monte Carlo calculations for radiation treatment planning in a
      clinical setting will be assessed by comparing results with other fully three-dimensional
      programs. ROB will investigate PEREGRINE for clinical use at NCI in collaboration with
      Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL).
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      The utility of PEREGRINE Monte Carlo calculations for radiation treatment planning in a
      clinical setting will be assessed by comparing results with other fully three-dimensional
      programs. ROB will investigate PEREGRINE for clinical use at NCI.
