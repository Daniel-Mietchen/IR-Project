TITLE:
Shark Cartilage in Treating Patients With Advanced Colorectal or Breast Cancer

CONDITION:
Breast Cancer

INTERVENTION:
BenFin

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Shark cartilage extract may help shrink or slow the growth of colorectal cancer
      or breast cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of shark cartilage in
      treating patients who have advanced colorectal cancer or advanced breast cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine whether the addition of powdered shark cartilage (BeneFin) to standard
           therapy improves overall survival in patients with advanced colorectal or breast
           cancer.

        -  Determine whether this therapy has any impact on toxicity in these patients.

        -  Determine whether this therapy improves the quality of life in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to disease type (breast vs colorectal female vs colorectal male),
      age (49 and under vs 50-69 vs 70 and over), ECOG performance status (0-1 vs 2), baseline
      quality of life (UNISCALE rating less than 50% vs 50-75% vs more than 75%), and concurrent
      chemotherapy (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.
