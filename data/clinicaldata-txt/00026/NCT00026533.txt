TITLE:
Thalidomide in Treating Patients With Thyroid Cancer

CONDITION:
Head and Neck Cancer

INTERVENTION:
thalidomide

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Thalidomide may stop the growth of thyroid cancer by stopping blood flow to the
      tumor.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness thalidomide in treating patients who have
      thyroid cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of thalidomide, in terms of tumor response and
           duration of response, in patients with metastatic follicular, papillary, or medullary
           thyroid carcinoma that is unresponsive to systemic radioiodine.

        -  Compare the differences in antitumor activity of this drug in patients with medullary
           carcinomas vs those with papillary or follicular carcinomas.

        -  Determine the toxic effects and duration of toxic effects of this drug in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral thalidomide once daily for 2 weeks and then twice daily.
      Treatment continues for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.

               -  Unresectable, distantly metastatic tumor that does not concentrate radioactive
                  iodine

               -  Follicular or papillary thyroid carcinoma with a large distant tumor burden that

          -  Fertile patients must use effective double contraception (1 hormonal method plus 1
             barrier method OR 2 simultaneous barrier methods) for female patients or barrier
             contraception for male patients for more than 4 weeks prior to, during, and for at
             least 4 weeks after study participation

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY:

        Biologic therapy:

          -  No prior thalidomide

          -  Not specified

        Radiotherapy:

          -  See Disease Characteristics

          -  Prior radiotherapy allowed

          -  Concurrent limited external-beam radiotherapy to isolated sites of bony metastases
             allowed, provided that these sites are not the sole sites of metastatic disease and
