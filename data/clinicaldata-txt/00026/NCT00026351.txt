TITLE:
Pentostatin and Rituximab in Treating Patients With Low-Grade Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma or Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia

CONDITION:
Leukemia

INTERVENTION:
rituximab

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab can locate cancer cells
      and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal
      cells. Combining chemotherapy with monoclonal antibody therapy may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining pentostatin and rituximab in
      treating patients who have non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with low-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or
           chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with pentostatin and rituximab.

        -  Determine the duration of response, median time to progression, and survival of
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive rituximab IV alone on day 1 of course 1 only. Patients then receive
      rituximab IV and pentostatin IV on days 8, 15, and 22. An additional course with both drugs
      is administered on days 36, 43, and 50. Patients with progressive disease or a complete
      response receive no further treatment. Patients with responsive disease, but less than a
      complete response, receive one additional course of therapy as above.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 50 chronic lymphocytic leukemia
      patients will be accrued for this study.

                  The terminology of "indolent" or "aggressive" lymphoma will replace the former
                  terminology of "low", "intermediate", or "high" grade lymphoma. However, this
                  protocol uses the former terminology.
