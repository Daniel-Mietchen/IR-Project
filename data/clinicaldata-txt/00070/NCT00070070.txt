TITLE:
Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Transitional Cell Cancer of the Bladder

CONDITION:
Bladder Cancer

INTERVENTION:
BCG vaccine

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from peptides may make the body build an immune response to kill
      tumor cells. Biological therapies, such as BCG and sargramostim, use different ways to
      stimulate the immune system and stop tumor cells from growing. Combining vaccine therapy
      with biological therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects of giving vaccine therapy together
      with BCG and sargramostim in treating patients who have undergone cystectomy for
      transitional cell cancer of the bladder.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of NY-ESO-1 peptide vaccine, BCG, and
           sargramostim (GM-CSF) in post-cystectomy patients with transitional cell carcinoma of
           the bladder expressing NY-ESO-1 or LAGE-1 antigen.

        -  Determine the immunological profile (NY-ESO-1 antibody, CD8+ cells, and delayed-type
           hypersensitivity) induced by this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, pilot study.

      Patients receive NY-ESO-1 peptide vaccine mixed with BCG intradermally (ID) once weekly on
      weeks 1 and 2. Patients then receive NY-ESO-1 peptide mixed with sargramostim (GM-CSF) ID
      once weekly on day 2 of weeks 3-6. Patients also receive GM-CSF subcutaneously alone on days
      1, 3, 4, and 5 of weeks 3-6. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 2 and 6 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-28 patients (8 HLA-A2 positive with prior intravesical BCG,
      8 HLA-A2 positive without prior intravesical BCG, 4-6 HLA-A2 negative with prior
      intravesical BCG, and 4-6 HLA-A2 negative without prior intravesical BCG) will be accrued
      for this study within 15 months.
