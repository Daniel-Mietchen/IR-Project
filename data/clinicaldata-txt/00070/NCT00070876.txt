TITLE:
Psychosocial Training for Pediatric Health Care Providers

CONDITION:
Mental Disorders Diagnosed in Childhood

INTERVENTION:
Mental health communication skills training

SUMMARY:

      This study will provide psychosocial training to general health care providers to help them
      provide better care to children with mental health problems.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Up to 20% of school-age children have one or more mental health conditions that require
      treatment. These conditions are often treated by generalists. However, a significant
      proportion of children who seek treatment from generalists do not receive effective
      treatment. Studies indicate that generalists who treat adults can improve the administration
      of treatment after taking part in training programs, but these studies have yet to be
      translated into pediatric settings. This study will conduct a training program to help
      generalists provide effective treatments to children with mental health problems.

      This study will evaluate a two-session, highly interactive training program in which general
      clinicians receive psychosocial training. The training program includes skills related to
      engaging parents and children, problem identification, solution-focused cognitive therapy,
      and making effective mental health referrals.

      The child's mental health symptoms, functioning, changes in utilization of pediatric
      services, and utilization of community services will be measured along with the mother's
      emotional well-being and family functioning.
