TITLE:
MLN2704 in Subjects With Metastatic Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer

CONDITION:
Prostatic Neoplasms

INTERVENTION:
MLN2704 (DM1 conjugated monoclonal antibody MLN591)

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of the study is to determine the highest dose of MLN2704 that can be given
      multiple times safely to patients with prostate cancer, and to identify any side effects
      associated with taking the drug. This study will also evaluate how MLN2704 is taken up,
      broken down and eliminated by the body.

               3. Progressive PSA levels (as defined in Section 3.6.1)

          -  Subjects who have received an anti-androgen must have shown progression of disease
             following discontinuation of the anti-androgen

          -  Subjects must remain on luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analog therapy
             for the duration of the trial unless surgically castrate

          -  Prior cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy within 6 weeks of dosing

          -  Use of anti-androgen therapy (eg, flutamide, bicalutamide, nilutamide) within 6 weeks
             of dosing

          -  Prior monoclonal antibody administration, including Prostascint

          -  Peripheral neuropathy of > Grade 2, as defined by the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria
             for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE)

          -  History of CNS metastasis, including incompletely treated epidural disease

          -  History of Hepatitis B or C

          -  History of seizure disorder requiring active treatment and/or stroke

          -  History of HIV infection

          -  Abnormal coagulation profile (elevated PT, and/or INR, PTT)

          -  Serum creatinine >2.0 mg/dL, or creatinine clearance <60 mL/min if serum creatinine
             >2.0 mg/dL

          -  Other serious illness(es) involving the cardiac, respiratory, CNS, renal, hepatic or
             hematological organ systems that might preclude completion of this study or interfere
             with determination of causality of any adverse effects experienced in this study.
