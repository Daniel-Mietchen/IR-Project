TITLE:
Functional Brain Imaging - Acupuncture and Osteoarthritis

CONDITION:
Osteoarthritis

INTERVENTION:
acupuncture

SUMMARY:

      The goal of this study is to use single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (f-MRI) of the brain to study the response of both
      normal participants and participants with Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee to acupuncture.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Recent experimental studies in both animal and humans have begun to demonstrate some
      measurable physiologic effects that are associated with acupuncture, suggesting the
      possibility of a neurophysiologic explanation. In addition, brain research continues to
      uncover a complex set of endogenous neurologic control systems, such that it has become
      clear that the brain plays a major role in the modulation of pain perception and control. If
      acupuncture can be demonstrated to have a consistent effect on specific areas of the brain,
      it will become possible to explore the potential efficacy of acupuncture based on measurable
      neurophysiologic responses.
