TITLE:
Pharmacokinetic Study of Palifermin in Subjects Receiving Radiation Therapy and Chemotherapy Followed by Blood Stem Cell Support

CONDITION:
Leukemia

INTERVENTION:
Palifermin 6 x 60 g/kg/day

SUMMARY:

      Open label palifermin will be administered to subjects who are at a risk of developing
      mucositis after radiotherapy and chemotherapy followed by blood stem cell support. The
      amount of palifermin in the blood following administration will be evaluated. The safety of
      palifermin administration and its effect on reducing mucositis will also be evaluated.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Mucositis is a common side effect to chemotherapy and radiotherapy involving the formation
      of erythema and ulcerative lesions in the mouth. Mucositis can be serious, resulting in pain
      requiring interventions such as analgesic medications and the use of parenteral feedings.
      Currently, no standard therapy is available to prevent or treat mucositis.
