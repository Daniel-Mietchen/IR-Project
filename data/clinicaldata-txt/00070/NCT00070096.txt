TITLE:
Ixabepilone in Treating Patients With Advanced Cisplatin-Refractory Germ Cell Tumors

CONDITION:
Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors

INTERVENTION:
ixabepilone

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ixabepilone, work in different ways to stop
      tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well ixabepilone works in treating patients
      with metastatic germ cell tumors that are refractory to cisplatin.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy of ixabepilone in patients with metastatic cisplatin-refractory
           germ cell tumors.

        -  Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive ixabepilone IV over 3 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-29 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.3-4
      years.

Criteria:

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Histologically confirmed germ cell tumor (GCT) (seminoma or non-seminoma) meeting the
             following criteria:

               -  Measurable metastatic disease by one of the following methods:

                    -  Radiography

                         -  If eligibility is defined by measurable disease only, there must be at
                            least 1 site that has not been previously irradiated

                    -  Alpha-fetoprotein greater than 15 ng/mL and/or -human chorionic

               -  Deemed to be cisplatin-refractory after prior cisplatin-based regimen AND does
                  not want to have potentially curative high-dose therapy (mediastinal or primary
                  refractory GCT)
