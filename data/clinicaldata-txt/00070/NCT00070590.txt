TITLE:
Efficacy and Safety of Oral Bosentan in Pulmonary Fibrosis Associated With Scleroderma

CONDITION:
Pulmonary Fibrosis

INTERVENTION:
Bosentan

SUMMARY:

      Clinical and experimental studies suggest that bosentan could delay the progression of
      interstitial lung disease (ILD) associated with systemic sclerosis (SSc), a condition for
      which no established efficacious treatment is available. The present trial investigates a
      possible use of oral bosentan, which is currently approved for the treatment of symptoms of
      pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) WHO Class III and IV, to a new category of patients
      suffering from ILD associated with SSc.
