TITLE:
Kanglaite Injection Phase I Study

CONDITION:
Solid Tumors Refractory To Standard Therapy

INTERVENTION:
Kanglaite Injection (KLT)

SUMMARY:

      The Kanglaite Injection (KLT)is a novel broad spectrum anti-cancer injection produced from
      traditional Chinese medicinal herbs (the Coix Seed). It was approved in China in 1995 and
      has become the most popular anti-cancer drug in China. In June of 2001, the Phase I study of
      KLT commenced at the Huntsman Cancer Institute in Salt Lake City, Utah, with the objectives
      of 1) To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the safety profile of KLT in
      patients with refractory solid tumors; 2) To determine the pharmacokinetics of KLT in
      patients with refractory solid tumors; and 3) To gather preliminary efficacy data. The
      method of testing is open-label, sequential cohort, dose-escalation study.
