TITLE:
Rofecoxib After Surgery in Treating Patients With Stage II or Stage III Colorectal Cancer

CONDITION:
Colorectal Cancer

INTERVENTION:
rofecoxib

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Rofecoxib may stop the growth of cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor and
      killing tumor cells that remain after surgery. It is not yet known if rofecoxib is effective
      in treating colorectal cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of giving rofecoxib after
      surgery in treating patients who have stage II or stage III colorectal cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the overall survival of patients with previously resected stage II or III
           colorectal cancer treated with rofecoxib vs placebo administered for at least 2 years
           vs 5 years.

        -  Compare the relapse-free survival of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to participating center, site of disease (colon vs rectum), disease
      stage (II vs III), age, adjuvant chemotherapy (yes vs no), and type of chemotherapy regimen
      (1 vs 2 vs 3 vs 4 vs 5). Within 3 months of surgical resection alone or completion of
      adjuvant radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy after surgical resection, patients are randomized
      to one of four treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral rofecoxib once daily for 2 years.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral rofecoxib once daily for 5 years.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive oral placebo once daily for 2 years.

        -  Arm IV: Patients receive oral placebo once daily for 5 years. Treatment continues in
           all arms in the absence of disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 7,000 patients (1,750 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study within 5 years.
