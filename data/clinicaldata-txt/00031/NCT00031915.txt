TITLE:
Imatinib Mesylate in Treating Patients With Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma or Bone Sarcoma

CONDITION:
Childhood Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma of Bone

INTERVENTION:
imatinib mesylate

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes
      necessary for cancer cell growth.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of imatinib mesylate in treating patients
      who have metastatic or unresectable locally advanced soft tissue sarcoma or bone sarcoma.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy of imatinib mesylate, as measured by response rate, in patients
           with metastatic or unresectable locally advanced soft tissue or bone sarcoma who have
           failed one or more prior treatment regimens.

        -  Determine the clinical and laboratory toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease subtype.

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate twice daily. Treatment continues for 1 year in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60-120 patients (6-12 per stratum) will be accrued for this
      study.
