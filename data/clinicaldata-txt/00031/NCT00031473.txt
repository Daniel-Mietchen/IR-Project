TITLE:
Ribavirin to Prevent RSV Pneumonia in Bone Marrow Transplant Patients

CONDITION:
Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections

INTERVENTION:
Virazole (Ribavirin) Inhalation Solution

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of ribavirin, administered
      as an aerosol, in preventing progression of upper respiratory tract RSV infection to RSV
      pneumonia in bone marrow and peripheral blood transplant recipients.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      The study enrolls 90 transplant recipients with positive nasal/throat culture specimens for
      Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection. Patients are randomized into one of two groups:
      investigational treatment or standard treatment.
