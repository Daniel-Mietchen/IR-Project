TITLE:
Safety And Efficacy Study Of The Combination Of CpG 7909 And Herceptin In Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer

CONDITION:
Carcinoma, Metastatic Breast

INTERVENTION:
CPG 7909

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to determine if the combination of CPG 7909 and Herceptin is
      safe and effective in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.

      RATIONALE: There is preclinical data that supports the hypothesis that CPG 7909 may
      potentiate the action of Herceptin. This Phase I/II study is designed to evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of the combination treatment of CPG 7909 and Herceptin in patients with
      metastatic breast cancer who have previously been treated with Herceptin and chemotherapy.

      SCHEDULE: Patients will receive CPG 7909 weekly for up to six months.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Phase II part of study not initiated because the development plan modified the route of
      administration to subcutaneous injection.
