TITLE:
Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage II or Stage III Prostate Cancer

CONDITION:
Prostate Cancer

INTERVENTION:
HDR brachytherapy boost

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays and other sources to damage tumor
      cells. Internal radiation therapy uses radioactive material placed directly into or near a
      tumor to kill tumor cells. Giving radiation therapy in different ways may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving internal radiation therapy together
      with external-beam radiation therapy works in treating patients with stage II or stage III
      prostate cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the rate of late grade 3 or greater genitourinary and gastrointestinal
           toxicity after treatment with external beam radiotherapy and high-dose rate
           brachytherapy in patients with stage II or III adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

      Secondary

        -  Determine acute grade 3 or greater genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity in
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine freedom from biochemical failure in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine disease-specific survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine clinical relapse (local and/or distant) in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Develop a quality assurance process for high-dose rate prostate brachytherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prostate-specific
      antigen ( 10 ng/mL vs 11-20 ng/mL), T stage (T1c-T2c vs T3a-T3b), combined Gleason score
      (2-6 vs 7 vs 8-10), prior hormonal therapy (no vs yes), and timing of high-dose rate
      brachytherapy (before external beam radiotherapy vs after external beam radiotherapy).

      Patients undergo external beam radiotherapy over approximately 15 minutes once daily 5 days
      a week for 5 weeks. Patients also receive two fractions (within a 24-hour period) of
      high-dose rate brachytherapy (delivered through an implant inserted into the prostate) over
      approximately 5-30 minutes either before or after external beam radiotherapy. Treatment
      continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 3, 7, 9, and 12 months, every 6 months for 5 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 110 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
