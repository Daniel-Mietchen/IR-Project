TITLE:
Study of the BiovaxId Tumor Derived Idiotype Vaccine in Patients With Follicular Lymphoma

CONDITION:
Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma

INTERVENTION:
FNHLId1

SUMMARY:

      The primary objective of this Phase 3 study is to definitively confirm the safety and
      efficacy of BiovaxId, an autologous tumor derived immunoglobulin idiotype vaccine, as
      measured by a significant prolongation of the period of disease free survival when
      administered to patients with indolent follicular Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) during their
      first complete remission.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Patients with Stage III-IV follicular lymphoma and tumor > 2cm (Stage II allowed if tumor >
      5cm), previously untreated by other than local radiation, provide tumor material by tissue
      biopsy for production of a patient-specific Ig idiotype vaccine conjugated to the
      immunogenic protein KLH. After completing PACE or CHOP-R chemotherapy and achieving a
      complete remission, followed by a waiting period to reconstitute the immune system, patients
      who remain in remission randomized to the active treatment arm receive a series of 5
      idiotype vaccinations accompanied by the immune stimulant GM-CSF. Patients randomized to the
      control arm receive a time-matched series of KLH injections also accompanied by GM-CSF.
      Patients are subsequently studied to observe their immune responses both to the non-specific
      immune stimulating agents and for the specific immune response to the vaccine. Patients are
      followed for a minimum of 4 years post-randomization or until relapse.
