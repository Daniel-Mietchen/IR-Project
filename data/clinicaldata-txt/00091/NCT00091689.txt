TITLE:
Safety and Efficacy of an Immune Response Modifier to Treat Inoperable Advanced Melanoma Skin Lesions

CONDITION:
Melanoma

INTERVENTION:
852A

SUMMARY:

      Study 1501-852A is a Phase 1 Study with the objective of determining safety and the highest
      tolerated dose of an immune response modifier cream directly applied to advanced,
      inoperable, melanoma skin lesions. The study will also measure blood levels of the drug and
      examine the potential anti-tumor activity of the cream.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
NONE

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 18 Years to N/A
Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have melanoma cutaneous metastasis or lentigo maligna melanoma unresectable and for
             which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer
             effective.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than or equal to 2

          -  Have a life expectancy of 4 months

          -  Have normal organ and bone marrow function

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Need for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) during the study

          -  Have a body mass index (BMI)> 30 kg/m2

          -  Have a history of, or clinical evidence of, myocardial ischemia, congestive heart
             failure, or myocardial arrhythmias requiring treatment within the past 6 months

          -  Have uncontrolled intercurrent or chronic illness, but not limited to, ongoing or
             active infection such as hepatitis B or C, immune dysfunction such as autoimmune
             disease, endocrine dysfunction such as hypo- or hyperthyroidism, psychiatric illness
             such as depression or suicidal tendency or social situations that would limit
             compliance with study requirements

          -  Have a history of disease requiring ongoing steroid treatment

          -  Have a history of seizure disorder (other than febrile seizures in childhood)

          -  Have a history of clinically significant coagulation or bleeding disorders or
             abnormalities

          -  Are HIV positive. HIV positive subjects are excluded from the study because of
             possible interactions with the immunomodulatory effects of 852A and because of
             potential pharmacokinetic interactions associated with combination retroviral
             therapy.
