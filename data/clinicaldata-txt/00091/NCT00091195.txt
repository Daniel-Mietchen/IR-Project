TITLE:
Depsipeptide (Romidepsin) in Treating Patients With Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial or Peritoneal Cavity Cancer

CONDITION:
Primary Peritoneal Cavity Cancer

INTERVENTION:
romidepsin

SUMMARY:

      This phase II trial is studying how well depsipeptide (romidepsin) works in treating
      patients with recurrent ovarian epithelial or peritoneal cavity cancer. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as depsipeptide (romidepsin), work in different ways to stop tumor cells
      from dividing so they stop growing or die. Depsipeptide (romidepsin) may also stop the
      growth of ovarian epithelial or peritoneal cavity cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor
      and by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the response rate of recurrent, platinum-sensitive adenocarcinoma of the
      ovarian or peritoneal to depsipeptide (romidepsin).

      II. To determine the toxicity of depsipeptide in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive depsipeptide (romidepsin) intravenously (IV) over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and
      15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients are followed up for 5 years.
