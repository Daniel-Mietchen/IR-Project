TITLE:
Two Dose Schedules of Panitumumab in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors

CONDITION:
Tumors

INTERVENTION:
panitumumab (ABX-EGF)

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of two dose
      schedules of panitumumab in subjects with advanced solid tumors.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
NONE

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 18 Years to N/A
Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathologic diagnosis of advanced solid tumors that are refractory to at least 1
             standard therapy or for which no standard therapy is available and have not received
             more than 3 prior treatment regimens (not inclusive of hormonal therapies for breast
             and prostate cancer subjects) for the advanced solid tumor (tumor must be diagnosed
             by standard criteria for the specific tumor type)

          -  Measurable disease or evaluable (non-measurable) disease per RECIST guidelines (all
             sites of disease must be evaluated within 28 days before enrollment)

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1

          -  Life expectancy of > 3 months as documented by the investigator

          -  If history of other primary cancer, subject will be eligible only if she or he has:

               -  Non-melanomatous skin cancer, not requiring treatment

               -  Curatively treated cervical carcinoma in situ

               -  Other primary solid tumor curatively treated with no known active disease
                  present for the last 5 years and no treatment administered for the last 3 years

          -  Man or woman 18 years of age or older

          -  Paraffin-embedded tumor tissue (from primary or metastatic tumor tissue) available
             for immunohistochemistry studies of EGFr expression (biopsy or archived tissue are
             acceptable). The immunohistochemical EGFr staining and evaluation must be conducted
             at the designated central laboratory using the DakoCytomation EGFR pharmDXTM kit.
             Local laboratory EGFr expression is not permitted for the purpose of eligibility in
             this study

          -  Hematologic function, as follows:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 1.5 x 109/L

               -  Platelet count > 100 x 109/L

               -  Hemoglobin > 8 g/dL

          -  Renal function, as follows:

             o Creatinine < 2.0 mg/dL

          -  Hepatic function, as follows:

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) < 3 x ULN (if liver metastases  5 x ULN)

               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) < 3 x ULN (if liver metastases  5 x ULN)

               -  Bilirubin < 2 x ULN

          -  Competent to comprehend, sign, and date an IEC/IRB-approved informed consent form
