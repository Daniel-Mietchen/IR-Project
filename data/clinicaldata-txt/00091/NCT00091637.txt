TITLE:
Pexelizumab in Conjunction With Angioplasty in Acute Myocardial Infarction (APEX-AMI)

CONDITION:
Acute Myocardial Infarction

INTERVENTION:
Pexelizumab

SUMMARY:

      In the setting of reperfusion therapy in an acute myocardial infarction using primary
      percutaneous intervention (PCI), the body's own inflammatory system involving the complement
      cascade may be harmful. This study will test the safety and efficacy of a novel complement
      inhibitor, pexelizumab to reduce mortality at 30 days.
