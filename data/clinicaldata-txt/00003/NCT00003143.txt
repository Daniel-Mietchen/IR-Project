TITLE:
Combination Chemotherapy With or Without Amifostine in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma or Hodgkin's Disease Undergoing Stem Cell Transplantation

CONDITION:
Lymphoma

INTERVENTION:
Amifostine

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Chemoprotective drugs such as amifostine may protect normal
      cells from the side effects of chemotherapy.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy
      with or without amifostine in treating patients with recurrent or refractory non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma or Hodgkin's disease who are undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the role of amifostine in reducing hematologic toxicity and
      improving mobilization of peripheral progenitor stem cells in patients with recurrent or
      refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or Hodgkin's disease who are undergoing platinum based
      salvage chemotherapy. II. Evaluate the role of amifostine in preventing renal toxicity in
      these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an randomized, open label study. Patients are randomized to receive salvage
      chemotherapy with intravenous dexamethasone/cisplatin/cytarabine (DHAP) with or without
      amifostine. Patients receive cisplatin IV over 3 hours followed by cytarabine IV for 2
      doses. Patients also receive dexamethasone orally or IV. Treatment repeats every 3-4 weeks
      for 2-6 courses. Arm I: Patients receive amifostine IV over 15 minutes prior to all courses
      of DHAP, as a 15 minute infusion, beginning 30 minutes prior to cisplatin administration.
      Arm II: Patients do not receive amifostine. On day 3 of the last DHAP course, patients
      receive filgrastim (G-CSF) until the last day of progenitor stem cell (PSC) mobilization.
      PSC transplant continues daily for 4-10 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients (20 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
