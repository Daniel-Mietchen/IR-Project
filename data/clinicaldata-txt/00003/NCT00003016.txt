TITLE:
Prolonged Tamoxifen Compared With Shorter Tamoxifen in Treating Patients Who Have Breast Cancer

CONDITION:
Breast Cancer

INTERVENTION:
tamoxifen citrate

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Estrogen can stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using
      tamoxifen may fight breast cancer by reducing the production of estrogen. It is not yet
      known if prolonged tamoxifen is more effective than shorter tamoxifen therapy following
      curative treatment for breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying giving tamoxifen over a prolonged
      period of time to see how well it works compared to giving tamoxifen over a shorter period
      of time in treating patients who have had a breast tumor removed.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Assess the balance of risks and benefits in prolonging the duration of adjuvant
           tamoxifen by at least 5 years in patients with curatively treated breast cancer who
           have already had about 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. After about 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen,
      recurrence-free patients are randomized to stop tamoxifen treatment immediately or to
      continue tamoxifen treatment for at least 5 more years.

      Patients are followed annually.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20,000 patients will be accrued for this study.
