TITLE:
Gene Testing in Patients With Colon Cancer

CONDITION:
Colorectal Cancer

INTERVENTION:
mutation analysis

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Analyzing the structure of genes found in a person's cancer cells may help
      doctors improve methods of treating patients with colon cancer.

      PURPOSE: Clinical trial to study the genes of patients treated with chemotherapy for colon
      cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the relationship between disease free survival, overall survival, and tumor
           replication error status for patients who have received adjuvant chemotherapy for colon
           cancer on CALGB protocol 8896.

        -  Determine the prognostic and predictive values for response to this therapy in these
           patients.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Patients who received chemotherapy for colon cancer as part of CALGB protocol 8896

          -  Underwent an initial resection for adenocarcinoma of the colon and were determined to
             have a high risk of tumor recurrence based upon nodal disease or local extension of
             tumor with obstruction or perforation due to tumor

          -  Surgical specimen blocks available, including tumor tissue and normal tissue
