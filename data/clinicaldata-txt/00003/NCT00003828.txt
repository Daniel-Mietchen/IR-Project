TITLE:
S9804: Vinorelbine in Treating Patients With Stage IV Melanoma

CONDITION:
Melanoma (Skin)

INTERVENTION:
vinorelbine

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of vinorelbine in treating patients who
      have stage IV melanoma that has been previously treated.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the response rate (complete or partial) of patients with
      disseminated stage IV melanoma treated with vinorelbine. II. Assess the qualitative and
      quantitative toxic effects of vinorelbine in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive vinorelbine by IV over 6 to 10 minutes weekly. Treatment continues
      in the absence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or complete response to
      therapy. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
