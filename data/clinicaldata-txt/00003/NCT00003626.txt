TITLE:
Dolastatin 10 in Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer That Has Not Responded to Previous Hormone Therapy

CONDITION:
Prostate Cancer

INTERVENTION:
dolastatin 10

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of dolastatin 10 in treating patients
      with metastatic prostate cancer that has not responded to previous hormone therapy.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective response rate in patients with hormone refractory
      prostate cancer treated with dolastatin 10. II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in
      this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive dolastatin 10 IV bolus every 3 weeks. Treatment continues for a
      minimum of 2 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
