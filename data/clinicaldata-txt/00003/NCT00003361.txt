TITLE:
Decitabine in Treating Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome

CONDITION:
Leukemia

INTERVENTION:
decitabine

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of decitabine in treating patients with
      myelodysplastic syndrome.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (including
      chronic myelomonocytic leukemia) to decitabine.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by disease (low
      risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) vs. high risk MDS vs. chronic myelomonocytic leukemia).
      Patients receive decitabine as a 4 hour infusion every 8 hours on days 1-3. Treatment
      continues every 6-8 weeks for 4-6 courses. Patients are followed at 6 and 12 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 75 patients will be accrued for this study over 1 year.
