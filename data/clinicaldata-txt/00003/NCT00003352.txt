TITLE:
Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Women With Stage IIIB or Stage IV Breast Cancer

CONDITION:
Breast Cancer

INTERVENTION:
cyclophosphamide

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy consisting of
      doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and docetaxel in treating women with stage IIIB or stage IV
      breast cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the overall response rate to doxorubicin, docetaxel, and
      cyclophosphamide (ATC) in women with metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer. II.
      Determine survival, time to first response, time to progression, and duration of response in
      these patients. III. Evaluate the feasibility of administering ATC for at least 4 courses.
      IV. Evaluate the toxicity profile of ATC and its effect on cardiac function.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive intravenous doxorubicin over 15 minutes on day 0, followed by
      intravenous cyclophosphamide over 30 minutes. An hour after the end of the doxorubicin
      infusion, intravenous docetaxel is administered over 1 hour. Patients receive courses every
      21 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects are observed. When the
      maximum dose of doxorubicin is reached, treatment continues with docetaxel and
      cyclophosphamide. Patients with locally advanced breast cancer receive chemotherapy for at
      least 2 courses after documented response. Patients are followed every 6 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 89 patients will be accrued to this study within 14 months.

        transaminase (SGOT) and/or serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) no greater than 2.5
        times upper limit of normal (ULN). Alkaline phosphatase no greater than 5 times ULN.
        Bilirubin no greater than ULN. No SGOT and/or SGPT greater than 1.5 times ULN if
        concomitant with alkaline phosphatase greater than 2.5 times ULN. Renal: Calcium no
        greater than 1.2 times ULN. Creatinine no greater than 1.5 times ULN. Cardiovascular:left
        ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at least institutional lower limit of normal on
        multiple gated acquisition scan (MUGA) or echocardiogram. No myocardial infarction within
        6 months. No angina pectoris requiring antianginal medication. No history of congestive
        heart failure. No cardiac arrhythmias requiring medication. No vascular disease with
        documented cardiac function compromise No uncontrolled hypertension (diastolic greater
        than 100 mm Hg). Other: Not pregnant or nursing. Fertile patients must use effective
        barrier contraception. No diabetics with fasting blood sugar greater than 200 mg/dL. No

        or non-breast cancer. At least 12 months since nontaxane containing adjuvant chemotherapy
        for primary tumor (in patients with metastatic disease). Prior adjuvant chemotherapy with
        anthracycline containing regimens allowed (provided total doxorubicin dose did not exceed
        240 mg/m2). Endocrine therapy: At least 4 weeks since adjuvant hormone or hormone therapy
        for metastatic disease (at least 2 weeks for rapidly progressive disease). No concurrent
        hormonal birth control. Radiotherapy: At least 4 weeks since prior radiotherapy. Prior
        breast radiotherapy following lumpectomy allowed. No radiotherapy to greater than 30% of
        bone marrow. No prior left chest wall radiotherapy with anthracycline containing adjuvant
        chemotherapy. Surgery: Not specified.
