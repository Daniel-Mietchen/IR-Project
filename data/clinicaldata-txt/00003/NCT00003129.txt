TITLE:
Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Early-Stage Bladder Cancer

CONDITION:
Bladder Cancer

INTERVENTION:
valrubicin

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy in treating patients with
      early-stage bladder cancer that has not responded to BCG therapy.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the recurrence rate and disease free survival in patients with recurrent or
           refractory papillary transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder with or without
           carcinoma in situ of the bladder treated with intravesical AD 32.

        -  Evaluate the safety of administering this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the effectiveness of this drug, in terms of recurrence rates and disease free
           survival, in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to cellular diagnosis (papillary transitional
      cell carcinoma (Ta/T1) with no carcinoma in situ (Tis) vs Tis with or without Ta/T1).

      Patients receive intravesical AD 32 once a week for 6 weeks.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 75 patients will be accrued for this study.

Criteria:

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Histologically confirmed recurrent superficial bladder cancer defined as papillary
             transitional cell carcinoma (stage Ta/T1) and/or carcinoma in situ (stage Tis) of the
             urinary bladder

               -  No evidence of invasion of the underlying muscle (stage T2) at baseline

          -  Must meet 1 of the following criteria:

               -  Failure of at least 2 prior courses of intravesical therapy, 1 of which must
                  have been a course of BCG

               -  Recurrent or persistent disease within 6 months after failing a 6-week course of
                  BCG followed by maintenance therapy

               -  Inability or ineligibility to complete 1 course of intravesical therapy with
                  BCG, and failure of 2 prior courses of intravesical therapy with an alternative
                  agent

          -  Diagnosis must have been made no more than 24 months after completion of prior
             treatment with intravesical immunotherapy or chemotherapy

          -  If carcinoma in situ is current or previous diagnosis, the biopsies must be obtained
             from at least 4 sites (bladder mapping)

          -  If prostatic urothelial biopsy discloses carcinoma in situ, transurethral prostatic
             resection must be carried out prior to study

          -  Papillary disease must have undergone complete transurethral resection (TURBT) within
             28 days before study
