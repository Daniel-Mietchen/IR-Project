TITLE:
Tamoxifen in Treating Patients With Primary Liver Cancer

CONDITION:
Liver Cancer

INTERVENTION:
tamoxifen citrate

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Estrogen can stimulate the growth of cancer cells. Hormone therapy using
      tamoxifen may fight liver cancer by blocking the absorption of estrogen. It is not yet known
      whether receiving tamoxifen is more effective than no further therapy in treating patients
      with primary liver cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare high-dose tamoxifen with no further treatment
      in treating patients with liver cancer that cannot be surgically removed.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the therapeutic role of tamoxifen in patients with inoperable
      hepatocellular carcinoma in terms of overall survival and quality of life.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study of tamoxifen. Patients
      are randomized to one of 3 treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive placebo orally twice
      daily for one year. Arms II and III: Patients receive tamoxifen, at 1 of 2 different doses,
      orally twice daily for one year. Quality of life is assessed before treatment and then
      monthly thereafter. Patients are followed monthly until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 300 patients.
