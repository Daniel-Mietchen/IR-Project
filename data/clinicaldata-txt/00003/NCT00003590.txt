TITLE:
S9811 Hydroxyurea in Treating Patients With Unresectable Benign Meningioma

CONDITION:
Adult Meningioma

INTERVENTION:
hydroxyurea

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as hydroxyurea use different ways to stop tumor
      cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well hydroxyurea works in treating patients
      with unresectable benign meningioma.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the partial and complete response rates in patients with unresectable benign
           meningioma treated with hydroxyurea.

        -  Assess the quantitative and qualitative toxic effects of this drug in this patient
           population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral hydroxyurea twice daily for 2 years in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 3 months, 6 months, and then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 38 patients will be accrued for this study within 13 months.
