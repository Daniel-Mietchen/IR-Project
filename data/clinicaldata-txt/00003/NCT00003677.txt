TITLE:
Dolastatin 10 in Treating Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer

CONDITION:
Pancreatic Cancer

INTERVENTION:
Dolastatin 10

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of dolastatin 10 in treating patients who
      have metastatic pancreatic cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the antitumor activity of dolastatin 10 in patients with metastatic
      adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. II. Evaluate the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects
      of this therapy in these patients. III. Investigate the clinical pharmacology of this
      treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter study. Patients receive dolastatin 10 IV bolus
      once every 21 days. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 12-37 patients within 18.5 months.
