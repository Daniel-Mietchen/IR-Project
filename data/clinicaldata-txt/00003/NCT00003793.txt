TITLE:
Genetic Study of Children With Soft Tissue Sarcoma or Rhabdomyosarcoma

CONDITION:
Leukemia

INTERVENTION:
clonality analysis

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Determination of genetic markers for soft tissue sarcoma or rhabdomyosarcoma may
      help doctors identify patients who are at risk for therapy-related leukemia.

      PURPOSE: Clinical trial to study genetic testing of children with soft tissue sarcoma or
      rhabdomyosarcoma to identify children who are at risk of developing leukemia from the
      chemotherapy used to treat sarcoma.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Identify genetically susceptible patients to therapy-induced myelodysplastic syndrome
           or acute myelogenous leukemia (t-MDS/AML) prior to initiation of high-dose chemotherapy
           for sarcoma.

        -  Identify patients who are at increased risk of t-MDS/AML during or after therapy.

      OUTLINE: Blood is collected from patients at diagnosis (preferably before chemotherapy or
      transfusion), at end of therapy, and at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years after
      therapy.

      Blood specimens are examined by clonality analysis (HUMARA), variant cell frequency
      (glycophorin A assay), GST NAT2/CYP1A1 genotyping, microsatellite instability, and ras
      mutation detection (single strand conformation polymorphism and sequencing of mutant
      alleles).

      Patients do not receive the results of the genetic testing and the results do not influence
      the type or duration of treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 321 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.
