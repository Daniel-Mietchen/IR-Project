TITLE:
Flavopiridol in Treating Patients With Recurrent Prostate Cancer

CONDITION:
Prostate Cancer

INTERVENTION:
alvocidib

SUMMARY:

      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of flavopiridol in treating patients with
      recurrent prostate cancer after hormone therapy. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different
      ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the clinical effectiveness of flavopiridol in patients with metastatic androgen
      independent adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

      II. Assess the toxic effects of flavopiridol in this patient population.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive intravenous flavopiridol over 72 hours every 2 weeks for at least 4
      courses. After 2 courses of treatment, patients not experiencing unacceptable toxic effects
      may receive a dose escalation. Patients are followed every 3 months until death.
