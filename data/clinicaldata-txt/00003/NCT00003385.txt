TITLE:
Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Untreated Ovarian, Peritoneal, or Fallopian Tube Cancer

CONDITION:
Fallopian Tube Cancer

INTERVENTION:
carboplatin

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy consisting of
      liposomal doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and carboplatin in treating patients who have untreated
      ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of doxorubicin HCl liposome when administered with
           paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with previously untreated ovarian epithelial,
           peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this treatment regimen in these patients.

        -  Evaluate measurable disease in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of doxorubicin HCl liposome (LipoDox).

      Patients receive LipoDox IV on day 1, carboplatin IV over 3 hours on days 1 and 22, and
      paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36. Treatment repeats every 42 days
      for 4 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of LipoDox until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. An additional cohort of 12 patients receives
      LipoDox at the MTD with carboplatin and paclitaxel as above.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 48 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
