TITLE:
Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer

CONDITION:
Kidney Cancer

INTERVENTION:
doxorubicin hydrochloride

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one chemotherapy drug may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining doxorubicin and ifosfamide
      in treating patients who have metastatic kidney cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy in terms of objective response after treatment with
      ifosfamide and doxorubicin in patients with metastatic sarcomatoid renal cell cancer. II.
      Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the effect of this
      regimen on the survival of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive doxorubicin IV on day 1 and
      ifosfamide IV over 2 hours on days 1 and 2. Treatment is repeated every 3 weeks for up to 8
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
