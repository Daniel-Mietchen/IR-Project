TITLE:
Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Mantle Cell Lymphoma

CONDITION:
Lymphoma

INTERVENTION:
filgrastim

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of different regimens of combination
      chemotherapy in treating patients with newly diagnosed mantle cell lymphoma.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Evaluate the complete response rate and duration of response in patients with newly
           diagnosed diffuse or nodular mantle cell lymphoma or their blastic variant treated with
           high-dose methotrexate and cytarabine and high-dose cyclophosphamide, dexamethasone,
           doxorubicin, and vincristine (HCVAD).

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients may receive either regimen A or both regimen
      A and regimen B, depending upon response.

        -  Regimen A: Patients receive methotrexate IV over 24 hours on day 1. Cytarabine is
           administered IV over 2 hours every 12 hours on days 2 and 3. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is
           administered subcutaneously (SC) daily beginning on day 4 and continuing until blood
           counts recover. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 courses.

        -  Regimen B: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 3 hours every 12 hours on days
           1-3. Doxorubicin is administered IV over 24 hours on days 4 and 5. Vincristine is
           administered IV over 30 minutes on days 4 and 11. Dexamethasone is administered orally
           or IV on days 1-4 and 11-14. G-CSF is administered SC beginning on day 6 and continuing
           until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 7 courses.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months
      for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-45 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.
