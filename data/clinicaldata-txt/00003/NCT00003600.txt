TITLE:
Epoetin Alfa in Treating Anemia in Patients Who Are Receiving Chemotherapy

CONDITION:
Anemia

INTERVENTION:
epoetin alfa

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Epoetin alfa may stimulate red blood cell production and treat anemia in patients
      with cancer who are receiving chemotherapy. It is not yet known whether epoetin alfa is more
      effective than a placebo in treating anemia in patients receiving chemotherapy.

      PURPOSE: Randomized double blinded phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of epoetin
      alfa with a placebo in treating anemia in cancer patients who are receiving chemotherapy.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether epoetin alfa treatment improves the quality of life in
      anemic patients who are undergoing chemotherapy for advanced malignancy. II. Determine
      whether epoetin alfa increases hemoglobin levels and decreases transfusion requirements in
      these patients. III. Validate or refute the use of an algorithm using pre- and posttreatment
      epoetin alfa, ferritin, and hemoglobin levels to predict 16 weeks response or no response to
      therapeutic doses of epoetin alfa as set forth by these patients. IV. Explore whether anemic
      patients receiving platinum-containing chemotherapy regimens experience less nephrotoxicity
      if they receive concurrent epoetin alfa compared to those who receive placebo.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind study. Patients are stratified by primary
      malignant disease (lung vs breast vs other), life expectancy (4-6 months vs greater than 6
      months), planned concurrent radiotherapy (yes vs no), and degree of anemia (mild or at least
      9 g/dL vs severe or less than 9 g/dL). Patients receiving chemotherapy are randomized to
      receive epoetin alfa subcutaneously once a week for a maximum of 16 weeks (arm I) or placebo
      subcutaneously once a week for a maximum of 16 weeks (arm II). Quality of life is assessed
      at randomization and monthly throughout study. Patients are followed every 6 months for 1
      year.
