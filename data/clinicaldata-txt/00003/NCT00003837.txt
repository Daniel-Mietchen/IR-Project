TITLE:
506U78 in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia or T-cell Lymphoblastic Lymphoma

CONDITION:
Leukemia

INTERVENTION:
nelarabine

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Clinical trial to study the effectiveness of 506U78 in treating patients who have
      relapsed or refractory T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia or T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Provide an investigational agent, 506U78, to physicians for the management of
           individual patients with relapsed or refractory T-cell acute lymphoblastic
           (lymphocytic) leukemia or T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma who are not candidates for
           entry onto ongoing research clinical trials of higher priority.

        -  Evaluate the toxic effects of 506U78 when administered as a 2 hour IV infusion 3 days a
           week every 21 days in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the antitumor efficacy of this regimen in terms of rate of complete responses
           in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive 506U78 over 2 hours on days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment repeats every
      21 days for a maximum of 12 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease
      progression.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for one year and then every 6 months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 25 patients will be accrued for this study.
