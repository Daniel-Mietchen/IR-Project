TITLE:
Denileukin Diftitox in Treating Patients With Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma

CONDITION:
Lymphoma

INTERVENTION:
denileukin diftitox

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Immunotoxins such as denileukin diftitox can locate cancer cells and kill them
      without harming normal cells. This may be an effective treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of denileukin diftitox in treating
      patients who have non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that has not responded to previous treatment.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective response rate in patients with previously treated
      stage I, II, III, or IV low- or intermediate-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated
      with denileukin diftitox. II. Determine the time to progression, duration of remission, and
      time to treatment failure in patients after treatment with this therapy. III. Determine the
      toxicity of this therapy in these patients. IV. Correlate the results of the inteleukin-2
      receptor assay with treatment outcomes in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to interleukin-2 receptor classification
      (positive vs negative). Patients receive immunotoxin therapy with denileukin diftitox IV
      over 15-60 minutes on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2-6 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3
      months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 33 patients will be accrued for the interleukin-2 (IL-2)
      receptor-positive stratum and a total of 11-44 patients will be accrued for the IL-2
      receptor-negative stratum.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically proven stage I, II, III, or IV low- or
        intermediate-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Small lymphocytic Follicular small
        cleaved cell Follicular mixed cell Follicular large cell Marginal Diffuse large B-cell
        Lymphoplasmacytoid Patients with small lymphocytic lymphoma must have an absolute
        lymphocyte count less than 10,000/mm3 At least one bidimensionally measurable site At
        least 1.5 cm in its greatest dimension Not in field of prior radiotherapy Progressive
        disease after at least one prior treatment regimen for lymphoma A new classification
        scheme for adult non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ. The terminology of
        "indolent" or "aggressive" lymphoma will replace the former terminology of "low",
        "intermediate", or "high" grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses the former
        terminology.
