TITLE:
Diagnostic Study of Gene Alterations in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia

CONDITION:
Leukemia

INTERVENTION:
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as genetic testing, may improve the ability to detect
      acute myeloid leukemia and determine the extent of disease.

      PURPOSE: Diagnostic study to try to detect changes in the genes of patients who have acute
      myeloid leukemia.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the frequency of partial tandem duplication of ALL1 (MLL) in patients with
           acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

        -  Determine the predictive value of partial tandem duplication of ALL1 to identify a
           subset of AML patients who have a short duration of complete remission.

      OUTLINE: All samples are obtained from specimens collected on CALGB-9665. No additional
      blood or bone marrow samples are collected.

      Samples are examined by Southern blot analysis for gene rearrangement at 11q23. Samples
      showing evidence of ALL1 gene rearrangement are further analyzed by reverse transcription
      PCR amplification and/or cytogenetic analysis to detect partial tandem duplication of ALL1.
