TITLE:
Carboplatin Plus Paclitaxel With or Without Continued Low-Dose Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Early-Stage Ovarian Cancer

CONDITION:
Ovarian Cancer

INTERVENTION:
carboplatin

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is
      not yet known whether receiving combined carboplatin and paclitaxel plus continued low-dose
      paclitaxel is more effective than carboplatin and paclitaxel alone for early-stage ovarian
      cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying carboplatin and paclitaxel alone too
      see how well they work compared to carboplatin and paclitaxel together with continued
      low-dose paclitaxel in treating patients with early-stage ovarian cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the progression-free interval and overall survival of patients with early stage
           ovarian epithelial cancer treated with carboplatin and paclitaxel with or without
           low-dose paclitaxel.

        -  Assess the frequency and severity of toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by carboplatin IV over 30
           minutes. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses. Four weeks after the completion
           of paclitaxel and carboplatin, patients receive low-dose paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once
           a week for 24 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by carboplatin IV over 30
           minutes. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses. Patients then undergo
           observation.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 500 patients will be accrued for this study within 5.5 years.
