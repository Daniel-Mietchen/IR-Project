TITLE:
Biological Therapy Plus Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Recurrent Kidney Cancer

CONDITION:
Kidney Cancer

INTERVENTION:
aldesleukin

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Biological therapies use different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop
      cancer cells from growing. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells
      from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining biological therapy with chemotherapy
      may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of biological therapy plus chemotherapy
      in treating patients with metastatic or recurrent kidney cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the toxic effects, patient tolerance, and practicality of
      administering interferon alfa-2b, fluorouracil, interleukin-2, and isotretinoin (FUNIL-cRa)
      in patients with metastatic and/or recurrent renal cell carcinoma. II. Obtain a pilot
      indication of responsiveness of these patients to this regimen. III. Evaluate the
      measurement of tumor thymidylate synthetase as a prediction of response of these patients to
      this and other fluorouracil based regimens.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by performance status (0 vs 1), nephrectomy (yes vs no),
      site of disease (pulmonary or lymph node metastases only vs other disease site),
      radiotherapy (yes vs no), and prior adjuvant biologic or hormone therapy (yes vs no).
      Patients receive intravenous fluorouracil daily for 14 days, and subcutaneous interferon
      alfa-2b 3 times a week for 6 weeks. Beginning on day 15, patients receive intravenous
      interleukin-2, 5 days a week and oral isotretinoin 2 times a day for 4 weeks. Treatment
      courses are 6 weeks, followed by a 2 week rest period. Treatment continues for up to 4
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with
      partial or complete response may undergo surgical resection. Patients are followed every 2
      months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued to this study.
