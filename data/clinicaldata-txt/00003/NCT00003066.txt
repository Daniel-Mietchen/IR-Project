TITLE:
Docetaxel Combined With Estramustine in Treating Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer

CONDITION:
Breast Cancer

INTERVENTION:
docetaxel

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of docetaxel combined with estramustine
      in treating women with metastatic breast cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate, duration of response, duration of survival, and
      quality of life effects of docetaxel and estramustine combination in women with metastatic
      breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive estramustine 3 times a day for 3 days. Docetaxel begins on day 3
      after the a.m. dose of estramustine and is given as a 1 hour infusion intravenously. Courses
      repeat every 21 days. If disease responds or is stable, treatment continues at the highest
      tolerance percentage of prescribed dose until appearance of disease progression. If complete
      response is documented, an additional 2 courses are given. Patients should receive a minimum
      of 2 courses unless rapid progression or unacceptable toxicity occur. Patients are followed
      monthly.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
