TITLE:
Radiation Therapy After Surgery in Treating Women With Phyllodes Tumor of the Breast

CONDITION:
Breast Cancer

INTERVENTION:
adjuvant therapy

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Radiation
      therapy following surgery may be effective in treating patients with phyllodes tumor of the
      breast.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well radiation therapy works after surgery in
      treating women with phyllodes tumor of the breast.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the local recurrence rate in women with phyllodes tumors of the breast
           previously treated with local excision with negative margins and are now treated with
           adjuvant radiotherapy.

        -  Determine the survival rate in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Within 12 weeks after prior local excision or breast reexcision, patients undergo
      adjuvant radiotherapy 5 days a week for a total of 28 treatments.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 10 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study within
      approximately 6-7 years.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Histologically proven phyllodes tumors of the breast with borderline or malignant
             grade, defined as 1 of the following:

               -  Borderline, defined as 5-9 mitoses/10 high power fields (HPF), pushing or
                  infiltrating margins, 2+ atypia

               -  Malignant, defined as 10 or more mitoses/10 HPF, predominantly infiltrating
                  margins, usually 3+ atypia with occasional 2+ atypia
