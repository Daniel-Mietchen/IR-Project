TITLE:
Prevention of Graft-Versus-Host Disease in Patients Undergoing Bone Marrow Transplantation

CONDITION:
Cancer

INTERVENTION:
graft versus host disease prophylaxis/therapy

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Bone marrow transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were
      destroyed by chemotherapy or radiation therapy used to kill tumor cells. Sometimes the
      transplanted cells can make an immune response against the body's normal tissues. Stem cells
      that have been treated in the laboratory to remove lymphocytes may prevent this from
      happening.

      PURPOSE: Clinical trial to prevent graft-versus-host disease in patients undergoing bone
      marrow transplantation.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine whether stem cell augmented, elutriated grafts prevent graft versus host
           disease in patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive elutriated CD34+ augmented donor bone marrow on day 0.

      Bone marrow samples are obtained before day 100, around 6 months, and 1 year after
      transplant.
