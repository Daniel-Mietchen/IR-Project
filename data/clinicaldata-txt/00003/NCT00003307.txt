TITLE:
Radiation Therapy Plus Amifostine in Treating Patients With Primary Prostate Cancer

CONDITION:
Prostate Cancer

INTERVENTION:
amifostine trihydrate

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Amifostine may
      protect normal cells from the side effects of radiation therapy.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of radiation therapy plus amifostine in
      treating patients with primary prostate cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the incidence, grade, and time course of acute grade 2 or higher
      gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicities in patients with primary prostate
      adenocarcinoma receiving amifostine plus fractionated radiotherapy. II. Determine the
      incidence and nature of toxicity associated with amifostine in these patients. III. Assess
      tumor response to this treatment in these patients. IV. Assess impotency rates following
      radiotherapy in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label study. Patients receive fractionated radiotherapy five days
      per week for 7 weeks plus amifostine IV push over 5 minutes, 15 minutes before each
      radiation treatment. Patients are followed at 1 month after radiotherapy, and then every 3
      months for at least 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 25 patients accrued into this study over 2 years.
