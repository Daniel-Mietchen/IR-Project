TITLE:
High-dose ICE With Amifostine

CONDITION:
Bladder Cancer

INTERVENTION:
filgrastim

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the combination of amifostine and high dose
      chemotherapy with blood stem cell support. Amifostine is a druf developed to protect normal
      tissues against the toxicities of chemotherapy and radiotherapy and has reduced the side
      effects of chemotherapy given at conventional doses.
