TITLE:
Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Women With Breast Cancer

CONDITION:
Breast Cancer

INTERVENTION:
cyclophosphamide

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is
      not yet known whether doxorubicin plus docetaxel is more effective than doxorubicin plus
      cyclophosphamide for breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of doxorubicin in
      combination with either docetaxel or cyclophosphamide in treating women who have previously
      untreated, advanced, or inflammatory breast cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the efficacy (response rate) and toxicity of doxorubicin in
      combination with either docetaxel or cyclophosphamide as primary therapy regimens in
      patients with locally advanced or inflammatory breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to participating center and operability. Patients are randomized to one of two
      treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive docetaxel IV followed by doxorubicin IV once every 3
      weeks. Arm II: Patients receive doxorubicin IV and cyclophosphamide IV once every 3 weeks.
      Patients receive a maximum of 6 courses of treatment in the absence of disease progression
      and unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo surgery (if operable) followed by more
      chemotherapy (if node positive), radiation therapy, and oral tamoxifen for 5 years (at the
      discretion of the investigator for estrogen receptor-negative patients). Patients are
      followed at 12, 18, and 24 months, and then annually for at least 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 350 patients (175 per arm) will be accrued for this study.
