TITLE:
Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Relapsed Acute Myelogenous Leukemia

CONDITION:
Leukemia

INTERVENTION:
cytarabine

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy consisting of
      cytarabine plus idarubicin in treating patients who have relapsed acute myelogenous
      leukemia.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the feasibility and efficacy of intermediate dose cytarabine plus
      idarubicin followed by low dose cytarabine in patients with relapsed acute myelogenous
      leukemia.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive intermediate dose cytarabine IV over
      2 hours twice a day on days 1-5, idarubicin IV over 24 hours on days 1, 3, and 5, and low
      dose cytarabine IV over 24 hours on days 6-15. If patients achieve complete remission by day
      35, this regimen is repeated once. If patients achieve partial remission by day 35, this
      regimen is repeated, except with an additional day of idarubicin on day 7. If these patients
      then achieve complete remission by day 70, the regimen is repeated. Patients may then
      undergo stem cell transplantation within 6 months of achieving complete remission. Patients
      who have an HLA identical sibling available receive an allogeneic transplant; others receive
      an autologous transplant. Patients are followed monthly for 1 year, every 3 months for 3
      years, then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-60 patients will be accrued for this study.
