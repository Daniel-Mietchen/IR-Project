TITLE:
Radiolabeled Folic Acid and Imaging to Detect Ovarian Cancer

CONDITION:
Ovarian Cancer

INTERVENTION:
radionuclide imaging

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures using the drug radiolabeled folic acid and imaging may be
      effective in detecting ovarian cancer.

      PURPOSE: Diagnostic trial to study the effectiveness of radiolabeled folic acid plus imaging
      in detecting ovarian cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the effectiveness of folic acid conjugated with indium In 111 to
      diagnose ovarian cancer and locate metastatic disease.

      OUTLINE: This is a diagnostic study. Patients receive an injection of folic acid conjugated
      with indium In 111. The patient then undergoes imaging studies at various time points (e.g.,
      1, 4, and 24 hours). Patients then undergo exploratory surgery, the results of which are
      then compared to the imaging studies.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
