TITLE:
Lymphocyte Infusion in Treating Patients With Relapsed Cancer After Bone Marrow or Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation

CONDITION:
Breast Cancer

INTERVENTION:
peripheral blood lymphocyte therapy

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: White blood cells from donors may be able to kill cancer cells in patients with
      cancer that has recurred following bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplantation.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of donated white blood cells in treating
      patients who have relapsed cancer following transplantation of donated bone marrow or
      peripheral stem cells.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Offer donor lymphocyte infusion as adoptive immunotherapy in patients with
      relapsed malignancies after allogeneic bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell
      transplantation and who are not eligible for other FHCRC protocols.

      OUTLINE: Patients with rapidly progressive disease receive reinduction chemotherapy and
      radiotherapy prior to study therapy. Donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) begin after recovery
      from chemotherapy or sooner, if clinically indicated. Patients receive 1 or more DLI from
      the original donor. Patients are followed monthly for 3 months, then every 3-6 months for 9
      months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: An unlimited number of patients will be accrued for this study.
