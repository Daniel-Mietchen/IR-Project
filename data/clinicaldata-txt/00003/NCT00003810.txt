TITLE:
Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Cancer of the Pancreas

CONDITION:
Pancreatic Cancer

INTERVENTION:
docetaxel

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining more that one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining gemcitabine and docetaxel in
      treating patients who have locally advanced or metastatic cancer of the pancreas.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective response rate of patients with pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma treated with combination gemcitabine and docetaxel. II. Determine the
      toxicity profile of this combination therapy in these patients. III. Assess the survival
      rate of these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour followed by gemcitabine IV over 30
      minutes. Patients receive treatment every other week for 8 weeks (4 courses). Patients may
      continue treatment in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients
      are followed every 12 weeks until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue approximately 10 patients per month for a maximum
      of 33 patients.
