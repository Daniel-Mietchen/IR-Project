TITLE:
Bleomycin in Treating Patients With Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma

CONDITION:
Lymphoma

INTERVENTION:
bleomycin sulfate

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bleomycin in treating patients with
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective response rate, response duration and survival of
      patients receiving bleomycin as salvage therapy for AIDS-related or immunocompetent
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. II. Assess the feasibility and toxicity of treatment for this
      disease. III. Evaluate the quality of life of AIDS and non-AIDS patients with non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by number of prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens, prior
      radiotherapy, and HIV/AIDS status. Patients receive bleomycin by continuous infusion for 72
      hours every 3 weeks. Induction therapy consists of 3 cycles. Patients who achieve complete
      remission receive 2 more cycles. Patients with partial remission or stable disease may
      continue therapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Quality of life
      assessments are conducted at beginning of therapy, every 3 weeks, and at completion of
      treatment. Patients are followed every 3 months for overall survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 32 patients will be accrued.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: N/A to N/A
Criteria:

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed recurrent intermediate or high grade
        non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) AIDS-related NHL eligible At least 1 evaluable or measurable
        disease as defined by the following: Radiographic findings are acceptable Bidimensionally
        measurable defect on a computed tomographic (CT) scan Clearly defined abdominal masses on
        CT scans Enlarged spleen and/or liver extending at least 5 cm below the costal margin
        Biopsy proven lymphomatous hepatic involvement No clinical or radiographic evidence of
        parenchymal CNS involvement by lymphoma (meningeal lymphoma permitted) A new
        classification scheme for adult non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ. The
        terminology of "indolent" or "aggressive" lymphoma will replace the former terminology of
        "low", "intermediate", or "high" grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses the former
        terminology.

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: Any age Performance status: ECOG 0-3 Life expectancy: At
        least 6 weeks Hematopoietic: WBC at least 1500/mm3 Platelet count at least 50,000/mm3
        Hepatic: Bilirubin no greater than 3.0 mg/dL Renal: Creatinine no greater than 3.0 mg/dL
        Other: May be HIV positive Immunocompetent (HIV-seronegative) NHL patients must be
        suitable candidates for bleomycin chemotherapy Active infections undergoing drug treatment
        allowed Negative head CT/MRI scan

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: Not specified Chemotherapy: At least 1 prior
        systemic chemotherapy regimen Endocrine therapy: Not specified Radiotherapy: Prior
        radiation therapy for localized stage I/II disease that has progressed beyond initial
        radiation therapy port is allowed Surgery: Not specified Other: Concurrent zidovudine,
        didanosine, or zalcitabine therapy allowed
