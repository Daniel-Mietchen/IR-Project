TITLE:
Biological Therapy in Previously Treated Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer

CONDITION:
Lung Cancer

INTERVENTION:
aldesleukin

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill non-small cell
      lung cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effect of biological therapy with interleukin-2 in
      patients with previously treated non-small cell lung cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate and median duration of response of interleukin-2
      (IL-2) in patients with previously treated non-small cell lung cancer. II. Determine the
      median survival of patients treated with IL-2. III. Further delineate the toxicity of IL-2
      in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label study. Patients receive bolus interleukin-2 on days 1-5 and
      8-12. The cycle repeats every 3 weeks. Patient response is evaluated after 2 cycles.
      Patients with stable disease, partial, or complete response may be treated with maintenance
      IL-2 for up to 4 additional cycles. Patient evaluation is performed after every 2 cycles. At
      this point, patients with stable or responding disease may be treated with IL-2 every 6
      weeks until disease progression, intolerable toxic effects, or 2 cycles beyond complete
      response.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued.
