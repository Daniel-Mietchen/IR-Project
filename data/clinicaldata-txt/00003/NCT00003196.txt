TITLE:
Low-Dose Total Body Irradiation and Donor Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplant Followed by Donor Lymphocyte Infusion in Treating Patients With Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, or Multiple Myeloma

CONDITION:
Adult Nasal Type Extranodal NK/T-cell Lymphoma

INTERVENTION:
chemotherapy

SUMMARY:

      This pilot clinical trial studies low-dose total body irradiation and donor peripheral blood
      stem cell transplant followed by donor lymphocyte infusion in treatment patients with
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or multiple myeloma. Giving total-body
      irradiation before a donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of
      cells in the bone marrow, including normal blood-forming cells (stem cells) and cancer
      cells. When healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the
      patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
      Once the donated stem cells begin working, the patient's immune system may see the remaining
      cancer cells as not belonging in the patient's body and destroy them. Giving an infusion of
      the donor's white blood cells (donor lymphocyte infusion) may boost this effect.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether mixed hematopoietic chimerism can be safely established using a
      non-myeloablative conditioning regimen in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and multiple myeloma.

      II. To determine whether mixed chimerism, established with non- myeloablative conditioning
      regimens, can be safely converted to full donor hematopoietic chimerism by infusions of
      donor lymphocytes (DLI).

      OUTLINE:

      CYTOREDUCTION: If necessary, patients with advanced malignancies undergo cytoreductive
      chemotherapy to reduce tumor size at discretion of primary physician and study
      investigators.

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients undergo low-dose total-body irradiation followed by
      allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplant on day 0.

      IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive cyclosporine intravenously (IV) twice daily (BID) on
      days -1 to 0 and then orally (PO) BID on days 1-35 with taper to day 56. Patients also
      receive mycophenolate mofetil PO BID on days 0-27.

      POST-TRANSPLANT DLI: Patients with mixed chimerism on day 56 and no evidence of
      graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) undergo DLI over 30 minutes on day 65 and may receive up to 3
      additional infusions in the absence of GVHD and disease progression or persistence. Patients
      who have not achieved mixed chimerism at day 56 undergo DLI if complete response is not
      obtained after a 2 month monitoring period.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months
      and then annually thereafter.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 50 Years to 65 Years
Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients aged > 49 years and < 66 years with NHL, CLL and multiple myeloma who are
             not eligible for autologous transplantation or have failed prior autologous
             transplantation; patients with NHL and CLL must have failed prior therapy with an
             alkylating agent and/or fludarabine; patients with multiple myeloma must have stage
             II or III disease and received prior chemotherapy

          -  Patients < 50 years of age with NHL, CLL and multiple myeloma at high risk of regimen
             related toxicity through prior autologous transplant or through pre-existing chronic
             disease affecting kidneys, liver, lungs, and heart will be considered on a case by
             case basis and presented to professional clinical counselor (PCC)

          -  Patients < 66 years of age with other diseases treatable by allogeneic bone marrow
             transplant (BMT) whom through pre-existing chronic disease affecting kidneys, liver,
             lungs, and heart are considered to be at high risk for regimen related toxicity using
             standard high dose regimens; autografting must also be contraindicated in these
             patients and they must be approved for this protocol by both PCC and by the principal
             investigator; the following diseases are the likely candidates but other less common
