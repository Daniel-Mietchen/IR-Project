TITLE:
Monoclonal Antibody Therapy in Treating Patients With Leptomeningeal Cancer

CONDITION:
Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors

INTERVENTION:
iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody 3F8

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver
      tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy in treating
      patients who have leptomeningeal metastases.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Define the clinical toxicities of intrathecal iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody 3F8
           (I-3F8) in patients with GD2 positive leptomeningeal neoplasms.

        -  Determine whether I-3F8 can detect GD2 positive leptomeningeal tumors.

        -  Measure the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels and serum pharmacokinetics of I-3F8 in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients receive a single injection of intraventricular or intrathecal iodine I 131
      monoclonal antibody 3F8. Patients without objective disease progression and no grade 3 or 4
      toxicity 6 weeks after the first dose may receive a second injection.

      Cohorts of at least 3 patients are entered at escalating doses of I-3F8. If grade 3 or worse
      toxicity occurs in 1 or more of 3 patients at a given dose level, then 3 additional patients
      are accrued at that level. If 2 or more of 6 patients at a given dose level experience grade
      3 or worse toxicity, then that dose is declared the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

      Patients are followed weekly for 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 3-30 patients will be accrued for this study over 2-3
      years.
