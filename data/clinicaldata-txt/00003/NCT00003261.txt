TITLE:
Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With HIV-Related Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma

CONDITION:
Lymphoma

INTERVENTION:
methotrexate

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more
      tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving methotrexate and zidovudine
      together with radiation therapy works in treating patients with HIV-related primary central
      nervous system lymphoma.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy in the
           treatment of HIV-related primary CNS lymphoma patients.

        -  Evaluate the toxicity and overall survival of these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive chemotherapy consisting of high-dose methotrexate IV administered
      on day 1 and high-dose zidovudine IV administered on days 1-3 every 2 weeks. Patients
      receive 3 courses of therapy. Following chemotherapy, patients receive radiation therapy to
      the lesion site daily.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 14 patients.
