TITLE:
Rituximab in Treating Patients With Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma or Hodgkin's Disease

CONDITION:
Lymphoma

INTERVENTION:
rituximab

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver
      cancer-killing substances to them.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of rituximab in treating patients who
      have non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or Hodgkin's disease.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate (complete or partial) to rituximab in previously
      untreated patients with stage III or IV CD20+ B-cell follicular small cleaved cell
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. II. Determine the response rate (complete or partial) to rituximab
      in patients with relapsed CD20+ Hodgkin's disease. III. Determine the time to progression
      and time to chemotherapy in these patients after treatment with rituximab.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease (follicular small cleaved cell
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma vs relapsed Hodgkin's disease). Patients receive rituximab IV over
      4-6 hours on day 1 weekly for 4 weeks. Patients are followed at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months,
      then every 6 months for 3 years, then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-32 patients will be accrued for each arm of this study
      within 7-10.5 months.
