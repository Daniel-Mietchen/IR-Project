TITLE:
Chemotherapy, Radiation Therapy, and Umbilical Cord Blood Transplantation in Treating Patients With Hematologic Cancer

CONDITION:
Graft Versus Host Disease

INTERVENTION:
anti-thymocyte globulin

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage cancer
      cells. Umbilical cord blood transplantation may allow doctors to give higher doses of
      chemotherapy or radiation therapy and kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and
      umbilical cord blood transplantation in treating patients with hematologic cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety, efficacy, and toxicity of using cord blood as a source
      for stem cell transplantation in patients with hematologic malignancies.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo autologous bone marrow harvesting or peripheral stem cell
      collection prior to transplant regimen, unless the patient has acute leukemia in relapse,
      aplastic anemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome. Arm I: Patients eligible to undergo total body
      irradiation (TBI) first receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -5 and -4, then
      undergo TBI twice a day on days -3 to -1. Patients also receive antithymocyte globulin (ATG)
      IV over 10 hours on days -3 to -1. Cord blood is infused on day 0. Arm II: Patients not
      eligible to receive TBI receive oral busulfan every 6 hours on days -7 to -4 for a total of
      16 doses. Cyclophosphamide, ATG, and cord blood are then administered as in arm I. All
      patients receive cyclosporine on days -2 to 180, methylprednisolone on days 5-180, and
      filgrastim (G-CSF) from day 1. Patients are followed weekly until day 180 and then monthly
      for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients (10 patients per arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 4 years.
