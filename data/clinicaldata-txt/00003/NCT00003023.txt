TITLE:
Monoclonal Antibody A1G4 Plus BCG in Treating Patients With Cancer

CONDITION:
Neuroblastoma

INTERVENTION:
BCG vaccine

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver
      tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Combining monoclonal antibody
      A1G4 with BCG may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody A1G4 plus BCG in
      treating patients with cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Assess the toxicity and feasibility of immunizing patients with anti-idiotypic rat
           monoclonal antibody A1G4 combined with Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) adjuvant.

        -  Determine whether immunization with A1G4 combined with BCG results in an immune
           response directed against GD2 ganglioside in patients.

      OUTLINE: All patients are treated with A1G4 diluted in sterile physiologic saline mixed with
      Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) organisms. The vaccine is injected intradermally in multiple
      sites. Booster immunizations are administered during weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 20, 28, 36, 44, 52.
      Immunizations are not administered in limbs where draining lymph nodes have been surgically
      removed or previously irradiated. Isoniazid is administered for 5 days after each BCG
      injection. If severe skin reactions are present at the injection site, the BCG dose is
      decreased. If skin reactions persist, the BCG dose is stopped but A1G4 injections continue.

      At least 6 patients are accrued at each dose level of A1G4. Dose escalation is not carried
      out until patients have been followed for at least 8 weeks after the first immunization
      without encountering grade 3 or worse non-skin toxicity.

      If 0-1 patient experiences dose limiting toxicity (DLT) at a given dose level, then patients
      are accrued to the next higher dose level. If 2 or more patients experience DLT, the MTD is
      defined as the previous dose level.

      Patients are followed for at least 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients are expected to complete this study. If patients
      are removed early from the study prior to evaluation for serological response, additional
      patients will be accrued until 6 patients are evaluable for serological response.
