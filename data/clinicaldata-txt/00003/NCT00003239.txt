TITLE:
Chemotherapy and Biological Therapy in Treating Patients With Chronic Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia

CONDITION:
Leukemia

INTERVENTION:
Recombinant Interferon Alfa

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining biological therapy with chemotherapy may kill more
      cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy with cytarabine and
      homoharringtonine and biological therapy with interferon alfa in treating patients with
      chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effectiveness of low dose cytarabine, homoharringtonine, and
      interferon alfa in stimulating a complete cytogenic response in patients with Philadelphia
      chromosome positive early chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia. II. Evaluate the
      duration of the cytogenic response in these patients after this treatment. III. Determine
      differential success rates and analyze results by prognostic subsets (e.g., risk group,
      splenomegaly, thrombocytosis, age, etc.) in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive debulking therapy consisting of hydroxyurea until blood count is
      at proper level. Patients then receive interferon alfa and cytarabine daily by subcutaneous
      injection. Homoharringtonine is administered by continuous infusion on days 1-5. Treatment
      continues for 5-7 years in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression
      (accelerated or blastic phase CML). If complete remission is achieved, peripheral blood stem
      cells are collected. Patients are followed every 3 months for the first year and every 6
      months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
