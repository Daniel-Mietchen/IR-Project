TITLE:
6-Hydroxymethylacylfulvene in Treating Patients With Refractory Myelodysplastic Syndrome, Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia, or Blastic Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia

CONDITION:
Leukemia

INTERVENTION:
irofulven

SUMMARY:

      Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene in treating patients
      who have refractory myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphocytic
      leukemia, or blastic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy use
      different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose for 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene in patients with
      refractory myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, or
      blastic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia.

      II. Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of this treatment in these
      patients.

      III. Determine the duration and reversibility of the qualitative and quantitative toxicities
      of this treatment in these patients.

      IV. Evaluate, in a preliminary manner, the antileukemic activity of this treatment in these
      patients.

      V. Assess relative mRNA levels of selected NER genes (ERCC1, ERCC2, and ERCC3) in tumor
      tissues of patients treated with this regimen and correlate with clinical outcome.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients receive 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene (HMAF) IV over 5 minutes on days 1-5. Treatment
      repeats every 3-4 weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3 patients receive escalating doses of HMAF. The maximum
      tolerated dose is defined as the dose at which dose limiting toxicity occurs in at least 40%
      of patients.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Diagnosis of refractory myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML),
             acute lymphocytic leukemia, or blastic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia MDS and AML

          -  After the maximum tolerated dose is determined, AML patients with an intermediate
             prognosis (i.e., complete remission of more than 12 months, but less than 24 months)
             are eligible

          -  No candidates for curative therapies such as allogeneic bone marrow transplantation

          -  No uncontrolled angina

          -  No myocardial infarction within past 6 months

          -  No concurrent grade 4 infection

          -  Not pregnant or nursing

          -  Negative pregnancy test

          -  Fertile patients must use effective contraception

          -  No overt psychosis, mental disability, or other incompetency that would preclude
             obtaining informed consent

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY:

          -  At least 2 weeks since prior biologic therapy and recovered

          -  No concurrent systemic anticancer biologic therapy

          -  At least 2 weeks since other prior chemotherapy and recovered

          -  Concurrent hydroxyurea allowed if needed to control blast counts

          -  No concurrent systemic anticancer chemotherapy

          -  At least 2 weeks since prior endocrine therapy and recovered

          -  Concurrent corticosteroids allowed if needed to control blast counts

          -  At least 2 weeks since prior radiotherapy and recovered

          -  No concurrent systemic radiotherapy

          -  No concurrent surgery

          -  At least 3 weeks since other prior investigational drugs (including analgesics or
             antiemetics) and recovered

          -  No other concurrent investigational drugs
