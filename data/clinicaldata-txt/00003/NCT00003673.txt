TITLE:
CMA-676 in Treating Older Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia in First Relapse

CONDITION:
Leukemia

INTERVENTION:
chemotherapy

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of CMA-676 in treating older patients who
      have acute myeloid leukemia that has recurred for the first time following at least 3 months
      of complete remission.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the efficacy of CMA-676 in elderly patients with acute myeloid
      leukemia in first relapse in terms of the number of patients attaining a complete remission.
      II. Assess the safety of CMA-676 in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, single arm, multicenter study. Patients receive 1 course of
      CMA-676 IV over 2 hours on day 1 followed by a 6 hour observation period. Patients may
      receive 1 additional course of therapy 15 to 28 days later. There is a 28 day follow-up
      period after the last dose of study medication. Patients are followed for an additional 6
      months, then every 3 months for 18 months, and then every 6 months until relapse and/or
      death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 23-55 patients will be accrued for this study within 12
      months. Enrollment will then be extended for up to an additional 55 patients.
