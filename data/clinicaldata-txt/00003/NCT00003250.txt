TITLE:
Fenretinide in Treating Patients With Solid Tumors

CONDITION:
Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific

INTERVENTION:
fenretinide

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of fenretinide in treating patients who
      have solid tumors.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and toxicity of oral fenretinide in
      patients with solid malignant tumors. II. Determine the pharmacokinetics of fenretinide and
      its metabolites. III. Determine the preliminary antitumor activity of fenretinide in this
      patient population. IV. Determine the recommended phase II starting dose of fenretinide. V.
      Determine whether fenretinide induces apoptosis in clinical specimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive oral fenretinide once daily on
      days 1, 8 and 9 and three times a day on days 2-7. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Treatment continues for up to 6
      months following complete remission. Accessible tumors are biopsied on day 8. Cohorts of 3-6
      patients receive escalating doses of fenretinide until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 21 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-9
      months.
