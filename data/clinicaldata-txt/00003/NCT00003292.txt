TITLE:
S9624 Ifosfamide in Treating Patients With Meningeal Tumors

CONDITION:
Chondrosarcoma

INTERVENTION:
ifosfamide

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of ifosfamide in treating patients with
      meningeal tumors that have recurred or that cannot be removed surgically.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Estimate failure free survival, overall survival, and response in patients with
           residual or recurrent/progressive aggressive meningeal tumors (malignant meningioma,
           hemangiopericytoma, and primary nervous system sarcoma) treated with ifosfamide.

        -  Evaluate toxicities of ifosfamide in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: All patients receive ifosfamide IV continuously over 72 hours on days 1-3 of each
      21 day treatment course. Patients are evaluated for response/progression after every 2
      courses. Patients with stable disease receive up to 8 courses of therapy. Treatment
      continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 35 patients will be accrued for this study.
