TITLE:
Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors

CONDITION:
Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific

INTERVENTION:
temozolomide

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of temozolomide in treating patients who
      have advanced solid tumors.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose, and dose limiting
      toxicity of temozolomide in patients with advanced solid malignancies. II. Characterize the
      single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of temozolomide following oral administration in
      these patients. III. Determine antitumor activity of temozolomide in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, dose escalation study. Patients receive oral temozolomide on
      days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients are treated at escalating doses of
      temozolomide. The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the dose at which no more than 1 of 6
      patients experiences dose limiting toxicity (DLT) during courses 1 or 2, with at least 2
      patients experiencing DLT at the next higher dose level.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
