TITLE:
SWOG-9507, Fenretinide in Treating Patients With Neoplasia of the Mouth

CONDITION:
Head and Neck Cancer

INTERVENTION:
fenretinide

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the
      development or recurrence of cancer. The use of fenretinide may be an effective way to
      prevent the development of cancer in patients with neoplasia of the mouth.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of fenretinide in preventing cancer in
      patients who have neoplasia of the mouth.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy of fenretinide in patients with oral intraepithelial
      neoplasia. II. Assess the toxicity of fenretinide in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral fenretinide on days 1-25 every 28 days for a maximum of 6
      courses. After 6 courses, patients receive a post-treatment biopsy. Patients exhibiting
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicities are removed from the study. Patients are
      followed at 3 and 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 51 patients will be accrued.
