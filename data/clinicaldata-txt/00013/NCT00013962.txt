TITLE:
Vitamin D Metabolism and the Williams Syndrome

CONDITION:
Williams Syndrome

INTERVENTION:
Vitamin D

SUMMARY:

      The Williams syndrome is a disease in which supravalvular aortic stenosis, an elfin facies,
      mental retardation and other congenital defects are sometimes associated with abnormal
      vitamin D and calcium metabolism. Whereas some patients have been reported to show increased
      sensitivity to vitamin D or an exaggerated response of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D {25(OH)D}
      to administration of vitamin D and to have hypercalcemia caused by increased circulating
      1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D{1,25(OH)2D} in infancy and early childhood, most patients have
      normal calcium metabolism and normal values for circulating 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D. We
      propose to carry out further studies of vitamin D metabolism to elucidate the mechanism(s)
      for abnormal vitamin D metabolism. We will determine the response of serum 1,25(OH)2D to
      administration of 1,25(OH)2D3. Measurement of the 1,25(OH)2D in the patients compared to
      normal subjects will be the primary outcome.
