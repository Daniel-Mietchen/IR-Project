DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Background:

      Due to the disputed efficacy of prostate cancer (CaP) screening and treatment, most
      authorities recommend that providers inform and involve patients in CaP screening decisions.

      Objectives:

      This study evaluated two interventions designed to facilitate this process.

      Methods:

      1152 male veterans age 50+ with no CaP and primary care appointments at four VA medical
      facilities in VISN 23 were randomly assigned to one of three groups: mailed pamphlet
      intervention, mailed video intervention, or usual care (control). Intervention materials
      were mailed two weeks prior to a target primary care appointment and patient telephone
      surveys were conducted one week (T1) and one year (T2) after the target appointment.
      Outcomes included: a 10- item validated knowledge index; responses to questions on CaP
      natural history, treatment efficacy, PSA accuracy, and expert disagreement about the PSA;
      whether screening was discussed with provider; scores on decision information seeking,
      participation and satisfaction scales; screening and treatment preferences; and PSA testing
      rates.
