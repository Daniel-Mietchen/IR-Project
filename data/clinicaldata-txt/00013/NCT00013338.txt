TITLE:
Supported Treadmill Ambulation Training After Spinal Cord Injury

CONDITION:
Spinal Cord Injury

INTERVENTION:
Ambulation Training

SUMMARY:

      This is a randomized, controlled trial to compare supported treadmill ambulation training
      (STAT) to conventional gait training for improving gait speed, gait endurance, gait
      efficiency and muscle function in SCI subjects injured more than six months prior to start
      of training. Each subject will receive twelve weeks of either CGT or STAT, given as 20
      minutes of training within a one-hour period per day, five days per week. These subjects
      will be studied baseline, 4,8 and 12 weeks of training, and three months after the end of
      training with a battery of tests designed to evaluate the subjects' gait and muscle
      function.
