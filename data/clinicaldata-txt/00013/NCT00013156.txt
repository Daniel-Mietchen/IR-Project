TITLE:
Cost-Effectiveness of Lung Volume Reduction Surgery

CONDITION:
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease

INTERVENTION:
Effectiveness of Lung Reduction Therapy

SUMMARY:

      Lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) has been advanced as a therapy to significantly improve
      quality of life in patients with COPD, but to date no controlled studies have evaluated the
      impact of LVRS.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Background:

      Lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) has been advanced as a therapy to significantly improve
      quality of life in patients with COPD, but to date no controlled studies have evaluated the
      impact of LVRS.

      Objectives:

      Evaluate cost-effectiveness of LVRS compared to current therapy for COPD.

      Methods:

      This is a case control study in which veterans undergoing LVRS at VA Puget Sound Health Care
      System (VAPSHCS) are compared to patients with a similar severity of disease at Boise VAMC
      who are not undergoing LVRS. Changes in health related quality of life are being evaluated
      using three instruments: the SF-36, the St. Georges Respiratory Questionnaire, and the
      Quality of Well-Being Scale, the latter to calculate utility associated with different
      health states. Costs will be determined using utilization data on outpatient visits,
      medications, oxygen use, inpatient days, radiology tests, laboratory tests, and emergency
      room visits are being collected for the twelve months before and after surgery. Costs will
      be calculated according to VA and community standards.

      Status:

      Complete.

        smoking for 3-mths; absence of co-morbid illnesses that would significantly increase
