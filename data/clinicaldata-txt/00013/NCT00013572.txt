HIV Candidate Vaccine, ALVAC-HIV-1, Administration in HIV-Negative Adults

CONDITION:
HIV Infections

INTERVENTION:
ALVAC-HIV MN120TMG (vCP205)

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to determine the best way to administer the candidate HIV
      vaccine, ALVAC HIV-1 (vCP205).
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Healthy adult volunteers are assigned randomly to either a vaccine or placebo group.
      Injections are received either intramuscularly, intradermally, or by delivery under the skin
      of the volunteer's own white blood cells which have had dendritic cell reinfusion.
      Volunteers are vaccinated at 0, 1, 3, and 6 month time points. Volunteers are closely
      monitored for 1 hour after vaccination and keep a diary of symptoms for 1 week
      post-immunization. Volunteers undergo leukopheresis at the start of the study and after the
      last vaccination at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Volunteers receive compensation
      benefits.
