TITLE:
Environmental Contaminants and Infant Development

CONDITION:
Mercury Poisoning

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      This study is designed to examine the effects of prenatal exposure to environmental
      contaminants on cognitive and behavioral development and physical growth in two groups of
      Inuit infants-one in Northern Quebec; the other in Greenland.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Due to prevailing weather patterns and ocean currents, certain environmental contaminants
      are transported to the Arctic region. The Inuit are among the most heavily exposed
      populations on earth due to the prevalence of these contaminants in traditional foods that
      comprise a large portion of their diet. The contaminants assessed in this study include
      polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), methylmercury, selenium, organochlorine pesticides, and
      lead. These contaminants are measured in umbilical cord blood samples obtained at birth,
      milk samples obtained from breast-feeding mothers and, in the case of mercury, hair samples
      obtained from the mothers. Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids are also assessed in these
      samples to examine the degree to which these nutrients may protect against adverse effects
      attributable to these contaminants.
