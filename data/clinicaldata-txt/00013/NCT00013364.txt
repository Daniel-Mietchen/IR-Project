TITLE:
Effects of Stimulus Validity on Speech Recognition

CONDITION:
Hearing Impaired

INTERVENTION:
Talker variability

SUMMARY:

      The effects of talker variability will be investigated with four groups of listeners (young
      normal-hearing; old normal-hearing; young hearing-impaired; old hearing-impaired).
      Experimental conditions will include between-talker differences, speaking rate, lexical
      difficult and semantic/linguistic context. A preliminary experiment will evaluate the
      relative merit of adaptive vs fixed-level methods of stimulus presentation.
