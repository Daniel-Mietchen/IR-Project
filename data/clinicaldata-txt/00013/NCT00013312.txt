TITLE:
Effects of Acute SCI on Colonic Motility & Tone

CONDITION:
Spinal Cord Injury

INTERVENTION:
Determine colonic tone

SUMMARY:

      This study will compare individuals with acute SCI to control patients in order to: 1.
      Determine if there are changes in colonic tone and sensation after SCI by comparing the
      fasting responses to the postprandial responses; 2. Determine if there are changes in
      colonic phasic motility after SCI by comparing the fasting responses to the postprandial
      responses; 3. Determine if colonic motor and sensory function after SCI change over time by
      repeating these studies six month later in SCI and control patients.
