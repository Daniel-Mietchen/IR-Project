TITLE:
Restricted Useful Field View as a Risk Factor in Older Adults

CONDITION:
Vision Impairment

INTERVENTION:
Prevention of Falls

SUMMARY:

      The relationship between Useful Field of Vision (UFOV) and falls taken by the elderly will
      be investigated. UFOV is a test which measures visual attention. The test has been used in
      correlating the visual attention in the elderly with their driving safety record. The test
      is administered using a computer and consists of three parts: a) subject views figures which
      appear in the center of the computer screen and identified them as quickly as possible;
      b)the subject has to identify figures in the center of the screen while at the same time
      point to another symbol which will appear in one of eight places on the outer portion of the
      screen; c) the third section is similar to the second except while the subject is
      identifying and pointing there is a background noise.
