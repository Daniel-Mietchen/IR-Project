TITLE:
Evaluation of Treatment Methods for Clinically Significant Tinnitus

CONDITION:
Tinnitus

INTERVENTION:
Tinnitus Masking

SUMMARY:

      The investigators propose to evaluate two different approaches to the alleviation of
      tinnitus symptoms by comparing changes from baseline performance on the Tinnitus Severity
      Index. They propose to provide an unbiased evaluation of competing methodologies. The design
      is one in which pairs of prospective subjects are randomly assigned to one of two treatment
      groups. Changes in group performance will be compared for selected measures.
