TITLE:
Medical College of Georgia FitKid Project

CONDITION:
Healthy

INTERVENTION:
exercise

SUMMARY:

      This project will determine whether exposing youths to a "fitogenic" after-school
      environment that emphasizes vigorous exercise and healthy snacks will have a favorable
      effect on body composition (i.e., less fat tissue and more lean tissue), cardiovascular
      fitness and cardiovascular disease risk profile. The environmental intervention will be
      provided in nine schools in Augusta, Georgia, with another nine schools serving as
      non-intervention comparison schools. Children in the 3rd grade will be recruited to
      participate. They will be followed for 3 years, through the 5th grade. Measurements will be
      made at the beginning and end of each school year. The 2-hour after-school intervention will
      be offered every school day. It will consist of three components: (1) homework assistance;
      (2) a healthy snack; and (3) exercise designed to improve skills and fitness.
