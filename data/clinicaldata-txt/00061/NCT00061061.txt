TITLE:
Tobacco Cessation in Postmenopausal Women (Part I) - 1

CONDITION:
Tobacco Use Disorder

INTERVENTION:
Behavior Therapy

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of ERT on appetitive behavior and
      withdrawal in short-term smoking cessation compared to smoking ad lib in postmenopausal
      female smokers.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Female subjects were screened and randomized. Following two weeks of medication monitoring,
      all participants continued smoking as usual for one week, at which time baseline
      measurements were taken. For the remaining two weeks (the experimental period), participants
      were randomized to a continued smoking or smoking abstinence condition. The abstinent group
      was provided with cessation counseling and monitored for abstinence. For all participants,
      data were collected during five clinic visits on all dependent measures: MNWS, QSU, Beck
      Depression Inventory (BDI), Profile of Mood States, Motor Speed Tasks and Reaction Time
      Tests. Question of interest was whether hormone replacement therapy would improve these
      dependent measures as manifested during short-term smoking cessation.
