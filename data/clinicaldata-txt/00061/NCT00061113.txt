TITLE:
Substance Dependent Teens - Impact of Treating Depression Study 1 - 1

CONDITION:
Alcohol-Related Disorders

INTERVENTION:
Fluoxetine + outpatient cognitive behavioral therapy

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of treating depression on substance
      dependent teens.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      The primary study aim is to determine whether fluoxetine + CBT is a more effective treatment
      than placebo + CBT for substance outcomes, depression, and behavior problems. The current
      community standard of care often withholds pharmacotherapy for depression in substance
      abusing adolescents, since it is often assumed that their depressions may remit with SUD
      treatment alone. However, this is an untested hypothesis in adolescents and one that we
      propose to test in the current study.
