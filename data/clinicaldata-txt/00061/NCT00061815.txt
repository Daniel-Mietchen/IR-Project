TITLE:
Study of Cetuximab, Oxaliplatin, 5-FU/LV Versus Oxaliplatin, 5-FU/LV in Patients With Previously Treated Metastatic, EGFR-Positive Colorectal Cancer

CONDITION:
Colorectal Cancer

INTERVENTION:

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to compare overall survival in patients with previously-treated
      metastatic, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-positive colorectal cancer treated with
      oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin (FOLFOX4) and cetuximab with FOLFOX4 alone.
