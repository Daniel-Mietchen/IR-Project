TITLE:
Videoendoscopic Drainage of Infected Pancreatic Collections

CONDITION:
Pancreatitis, Acute Necrotizing

INTERVENTION:
Videoscopic-Assisted Retroperitoneal Debridement (VARD)

SUMMARY:

      The VARD (Videoendoscopic Assisted Retroperitoneal Drainage) approach as treatment for
      necrotizing pancreatitis proposes an alternative to standard complicated open abdomen
      treatment methods.

      This treatment involves making a small incision and looking inside the abdomen with a
      videoendoscope. A videoendoscope is an instrument with a small camera and light on the end.
      It also has an extension tool that the surgeon can use to clean out any dead and infected
      tissue in the abdomen.

      This approach may reveal a treatment opportunity with faster recovery potential and shorter
      hospitalizations for patients with necrotizing pancreatitis.
