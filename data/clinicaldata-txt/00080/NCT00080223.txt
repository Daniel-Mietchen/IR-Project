TITLE:
Safety Study of Oral Pirfenidone in Patients With Pulmonary Fibrosis/Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis

CONDITION:
Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis

INTERVENTION:
Pirfenidone

SUMMARY:

      To assess the safety of treatment with pirfenidone (up to 3600 mg/d) in patients with
      pulmonary fibrosis/idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (PF/IPF).
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      This study has been designed as a rollover study to collectively include safety data from
      various previous studies.

      In addition, InterMune has also initiated an Early Access Program to make pirfenidone
      available to a limited number of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in the United
      States. This program is also being conducted under this protocol. Registration of patients
      with documented IPF has been closed as of October 2005.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 40 Years to 85 Years
Criteria:

        General Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able to understand and sign an informed consent form

          -  Understand the importance of adherence to study treatment and the study protocol,
             including concomitant medication restrictions, throughout the study period

          -  Patients must be willing to travel to an approved regional center for all
             study-related visits

        Roll-Over Criteria:

          -  Entry into study through rollover has been completed

        Criteria for Early Access Program patients:

          -  Clinical symptoms consistent with IPF 3 months duration

          -  Age 40 - 85, inclusive

          -  At the time of registration with National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD),
             patients with IPF must have a percent predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) of 50%,
             and percent predicted carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO) of 35%

          -  At the time of enrollment in PIPF-002, (screening/baseline visit) percent predicted
             FVC must be 45%, and percent predicted DLCO must be 30%

          -  High-resolution computed tomographic scan (HRCT) showing definite IPF. For patients
             with surgical lung biopsy showing definite or probable usual interstitial pneumonia
             (UIP), the HRCT criterion of probable IPF is sufficient

          -  For patients aged <50 years: open or video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) lung biopsy
             showing definite or probable UIP. In addition, no features supporting an alternative
             diagnosis on transbronchial biopsy or bronchoalveolar lavage if performed

          -  For patients aged 50 years: at least one of the following diagnostic findings as
             well as the absence of any features on specimens resulting from any of these
             procedures that support an alternative diagnosis: 1) Open or VATS lung biopsy showing
             definite or probable UIP; 2) Transbronchial biopsy showing no features to support an
             alternative diagnosis; 3) Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) showing no features to support
             an alternative diagnosis
