TITLE:
Safety and Efficacy Study of a Caspase Inhibitor in Patients Undergoing Liver Transplantation

CONDITION:
Liver Transplantation

INTERVENTION:
IDN-6556

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of the study is to test the safety and effectiveness of IDN-6556 in preventing
      liver damage that normally occurs when livers are transported before being transplanted and
      in the immediate post-transplant period.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      The occurrence of apoptosis in liver ischemia/reperfusion injury has been well characterized
      in animal models. In this context apoptosis has specifically been observed in sinusoidal
      endothelial cells and hepatocytes, and this has also been associated with an increase in
      activated caspase-3 in liver tissue extracts. The use of caspase inhibitors to prevent
      apoptosis during liver storage and transplantation may reduce ischemia/reperfusion injury
      and hence improve graft function after transplantation. Suppression of apoptosis by caspase
      inhibitors may also allow for longer ischemic times allowing organs to be transported
      greater distances. In addition, suppression of apoptosis may lower the risk involved in
      using suboptimal donor organs.
