TITLE:
Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy and Primary Tumor Gene Expression Profiling in Finding Axillary Lymph Node Metastases in Women Who Have Received Neoadjuvant Therapy for Stage II, Stage III, or Stage IV Breast Cancer

CONDITION:
Breast Cancer

INTERVENTION:
microarray analysis

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Sentinel lymph node biopsy and gene expression profiling of the primary breast
      tumor may help determine if tumor cells have spread to the axillary lymph nodes and help
      doctors plan more effective surgery for breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well sentinel lymph node biopsy and primary
      tumor gene expression profiling work in finding lymph node metastases in women who have
      received neoadjuvant therapy for stage II, stage III, or stage IV breast cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy of sentinel lymph node mapping for assessing axillary lymph node
           status after neoadjuvant therapy in women with stage II, III, or IV breast cancer.

        -  Correlate gene expression profiling of the primary breast cancer with axillary and
           sentinel lymph node status in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, patients undergo sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping
      comprising technetium Tc 99m sulfur colloid injected into the subareolar area to identify
      the SLN. Within 1-2 hours after injection, patients undergo SLN biopsy followed immediately
      by definitive local surgery comprising modified radical mastectomy or breast segmentectomy
      with axillary lymph node dissection. SLN and axillary lymph nodes are examined by
      hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) staining for the presence or absence of metastases. If the
      lymph nodes are negative for tumor by H & E, the lymph nodes are further analyzed by
      immunohistochemistry. The primary tumor is analyzed by microarray analysis for gene
      expression profile determinations.

      Patients are followed at 2-3 weeks after surgery.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study within 2-3 years.
