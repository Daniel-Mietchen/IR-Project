TITLE:
Treatment of Adolescent Suicide Attempters (TASA)

CONDITION:
Depression

INTERVENTION:
fluoxetine

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of three types of treatments for
      depressed teenagers who have attempted suicide.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Suicide is the third leading cause of death in adolescents and is a major public health
      problem. Depression is the most common diagnosis for adolescent suicide attempts. Little is
      known about what treatment is best for these adolescents since they are usually excluded
      from participation in research studies.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive carefully monitored
      antidepressant medication with routine support and management, cognitive behavioral therapy
      (CBT), or a combination of antidepressant medication plus CBT.
