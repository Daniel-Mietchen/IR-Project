TITLE:
Study of Talabostat and Docetaxel in Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer

CONDITION:
Lung Cancer

INTERVENTION:
talabostat (PT-100) tablets

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to determine the antitumor activity (response rate, time to
      tumor progression, survival) and safety of docetaxel in combination with talabostat in
      patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have failed a prior
      platinum-containing regimen.

             first-line therapy for advanced NSCLC

          -  Measurable disease

          -  ECOG Performance Status of 0 or 1

          -  Expected survival 12 weeks

          -  Provide written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  More than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens

          -  Brain metastases (exception: patients who have had a resection and/or completed a
             course of cranial irradiation, have no worsening CNS symptoms, and have discontinued
             all corticosteroids for that indication for at least 1 month)

          -  Any malignancy within the 5 years immediately prior to the first dose of study
             medication with the exception of basal cell or non-metastatic squamous cell carcinoma
             of the skin, and carcinoma in-situ of the cervix

          -  The need for chronic (i.e., >7 days) oral or intravenous corticosteroid therapy

          -  A history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to drugs formulated with polysorbate
             80

          -  A history of myocardial infarction within 1 year of study entry, CABG within 6 months
             of study entry, severe congestive heart failure (ejection fraction <30%), history of
             ventricular arrhythmia, or other uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia

          -  Any comorbidity or condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere
             with the assessments and procedures of this protocol

          -  Patients who are within 30 days of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, or
             other investigational medication for NSCLC. Patients must have recovered from all of
             the side effects of treatment in order to be enrolled.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women.

          -  Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities, specifically:

        Total bilirubin institutional upper limit of normal (ULN); Serum alanine aminotransferase
        (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 1.5 x ULN concomitant with alkaline phosphatase
        >2.5 x ULN; Hepatitis B surface antigen or antibody to Hepatitis C (anti-HCV antibody);
        Serum creatinine 2.0mg/dL; or Granulocytes <1500/L or platelets <100,000/L.
