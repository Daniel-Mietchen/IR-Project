TITLE:
A Study of Motexafin Gadolinium and Temozolomide for the Treatment of Malignant Gliomas

CONDITION:
Glioma

INTERVENTION:
Motexafin Gadolinium Injection

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to find out about the safety of adding the investigational drug
      motexafin gadolinium to a standard course of chemotherapy with temozolomide for patients
      with malignant glioma. Secondly, the study will determine how many patients will respond to
      this treatment.
