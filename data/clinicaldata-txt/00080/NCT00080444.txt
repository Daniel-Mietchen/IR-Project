TITLE:
Study of Aprepitant (MK-0869) for Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV) in Adolescent Participants (MK-0869-097)

CONDITION:
Vomiting

INTERVENTION:
aprepitant

SUMMARY:

      This study is being conducted to demonstrate that aprepitant (MK-0869) prevents nausea and
      vomiting caused by emetogenic cancer chemotherapy in adolescent participants. Participants
      treated with emetogenic cancer chemotherapies that include either cisplatin,
      cyclophosphamide, or carboplatin, or participants who experienced nausea and/or vomiting
      when treated with a previously administered chemotherapy regimen that is planned to be
      repeated will be enrolled in this study. In the double-blind Part 1 of this study, enrolled
      participants will be randomized to receive either aprepitant or standard therapy. In Part 2
      of this study, enrolled participants will receive open-label aprepitant.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      The duration of treatment is the first 4 days of one 28-day cycle (Cycle 1). Participants
      who successfully complete Cycle 1 may be eligible to participate for 9 subsequent optional,
      open-label, 28-day cycles.
