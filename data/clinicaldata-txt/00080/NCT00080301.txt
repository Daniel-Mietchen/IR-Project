TITLE:
Novel Epothilone Plus Capecitabine Versus Capecitabine Alone in Patients With Advanced Breast Cancer

CONDITION:
Breast Cancer

INTERVENTION:
Ixabepilone + Capecitabine

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this clinical research study is to learn if BMS-247550 added to the approved
      therapy of capecitabine is better than capecitabine alone in shrinking or slowing the growth
      of the cancer in women with metastatic breast cancer who are resistant to taxane and
      received anthracycline chemotherapy. The safety of this treatment will also be studied.
