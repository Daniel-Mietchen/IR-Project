TITLE:
Comparison of Teriparatide With Alendronate for Treating Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis

CONDITION:
Osteoporosis

INTERVENTION:
Teriparatide

SUMMARY:

      Osteoporosis is a condition in which the amount of bone is reduced, the bones are weak, and
      there is an increased risk for fractures. Glucocorticoids (such as prednisone) are
      prescribed to treat a large number of conditions such as arthritis and asthma. When taken
      for several months or longer, glucocorticoids can cause bone loss and lead to a form of
      osteoporosis called "glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis." This study compared the effects
      of teriparatide, the study drug, with alendronate, an approved drug for treating
      glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.
