TITLE:
Safety/Efficacy Study of SGN-15 (Antibody-Drug Conjugate) Combined With Gemcitabine in Patients With Ovarian Cancer

CONDITION:
Ovarian Neoplasms

INTERVENTION:
SGN-15 (cBR96-Doxorubicin Immunoconjugate)

SUMMARY:

      This is an open-label, randomized phase II trial comparing treatment with a monoclonal
      antibody (mAb) drug immunoconjugate, SGN-15, administered weekly in combination with weekly
      Gemzar (Gemcitabine) to treatment with Gemzar alone. The primary objectives of this study
      are to determine the toxicity and safety profile of the combination of SGN-15 and Gemzar,
      to estimate the clinical response rate and to estimate the duration of response of this
      combination therapy administered to patients with advanced ovarian cancer, compared to
      treatment with Gemzar alone.

             therapies for metastatic disease

          -  Patients must have > 20% Lewis-y antigen expression documented by
             immunohistochemistry

          -  LVEF > 50% by echo or MUGA

          -  Must be platinum resistant as defined by:

               -  Progression while on initial platinum therapy or

               -  Progression while on retreatment with initial platinum regimen or
