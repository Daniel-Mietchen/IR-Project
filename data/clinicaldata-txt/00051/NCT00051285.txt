TITLE:
ESSENTIAL-"The Studies of Oral Enoximone Therapy in Advanced Heart Failure"

CONDITION:
Heart Failure, Congestive

INTERVENTION:
Enoximone

SUMMARY:

      To determine if low-dose enoximone therapy is an effective treatment for advanced chronic
      heart failure.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      The study is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, parallel group, placebo-controlled
      trial of oral enoximone in approximately 700 subjects with advanced chronic heart failure of
      either ischemic or nonischemic etiology receiving optimal conventional heart failure
      therapy.

      Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either enoximone or placebo
      at the Randomization Visit. The initial dose of study drug will be 25 mg t.i.d.(3xday) and
      will be administered immediately after randomization. Subjects who tolerate this initial
      dose will be continued on 25 mg t.i.d. for at least two weeks. After two weeks, eligible
      subjects will be titrated to 50 mg t.i.d. for the duration of the study.

          -  NYHA Class III or IV

          -  one hospitalization, or two outpatient visits, for the treatment of worsening heart
             failure within 12 months requiring the administration of I.V. heart failure therapy

          -  LVEDD >3.2 cm/m2 or >=6.0 cm

          -  LVEF of less than or equal to 30%

          -  concomitant treatment with optimal conventional heart failure therapy

        Exclusion Criteria

        Subjects who meet any one of the following criteria will be deemed ineligible for
        participation in the study:

        Subjects on the following concomitant medications:

          -  Calcium antagonists other than amlodipine or felodipine

          -  Flecainide, encainide, propafenone, dofetilide or disopyramide

          -  Subjects receiving I.V. positive inotropic agents within seven days of the Screening
             Visit or Randomization Visit

          -  Subjects receiving a human B-type natriuretic peptide, including nesiritide, within
             seven days of the Screening Visit or Randomization Visit

          -  Subjects receiving oral or I.V. phosphodiesterase III inhibitors (PDEI III),
             including levosimendan and cilostazol, within seven days of the Screening Visit or
             Randomization Visit

               -  Subjects with active hepatic (screening serum total bilirubin >= 3.0 mg/dl
                  (>=51.3 umol/l), renal (screening serum creatinine >= 2.0 mg/dl (=178.8
                  umol/l)), hematologic, gastrointestinal, immunologic, endocrine, metabolic, or
                  central nervous system disease

               -  Subjects with a serum potassium <4.0 mEq/L or >5.5 mEq/L (<4.0 mmol/l or >5.5
                  mmol/l) at Randomization Visit

               -  Subjects with a magnesium level of <1.0 mEq/L (<0.5 mmol/l) at Randomization
                  Visit (Visit 0)

               -  Subjects with a serum digoxin of >1.2 ng/ml (>1.5 nmol/l) or a serum digitoxin
                  of >20 ng/ml (>26.2 nmol/l) at the Randomization Visit are excluded. A target
                  serum digoxin level of <=1.0 ng/ml (<=1.3 nmol/l) is recommended
