TITLE:
Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Malignant Glioma

CONDITION:
Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors

INTERVENTION:
therapeutic autologous dendritic cells

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a person's white blood cells mixed with tumor proteins may
      make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vaccine therapy in
      treating patients with malignant glioma.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of autologous tumor
           lysate-pulsed dendritic cells in patients with malignant gliomas.

        -  Determine survival, tumor progression, and cellular immune response in patients treated
           with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients undergo leukapheresis for the collection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells
      (PBMC). Autologous dendritic cells (DC) are prepared from autologous PBMC exposed to
      sargramostim (GM-CSF) and interleukin-4 and pulsed with autologous tumor lysate. Patients
      receive autologous tumor lysate-pulsed DC intradermally on days 0, 14, and 28 in the absence
      of unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 6-12 patients receive escalating doses of autologous tumor lysate-pulsed DC until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding
      that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-18 patients will be accrued for this study within 9-18
      months.
