TITLE:
GTI-2040 and Capecitabine in Treating Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer

CONDITION:
Male Breast Cancer

INTERVENTION:
GTI-2040

SUMMARY:

      This phase II trial is studying how well giving GTI-2040 together with capecitabine works in
      treating patients with metastatic breast cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      capecitabine, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing
      or die. GTI-2040 may help capecitabine kill more tumor cells by making them more sensitive
      to the drug
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the response rate and response duration to combination therapy with GTI-2040
      and capecitabine in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.

      II. To safely evaluate the toxicity of this drug combination and schedule in this patient
      population by first using a lower dose followed by escalation.

      III. To determine pharmacokinetic data on plasma levels of GTI-2040 in this patient
      population.

      IV. To investigate potential molecular markers of ribonucleotide reductase inhibition and
      fluoropyrimidine metabolism in this patient population treated with the combination of
      GTI-2040 and capecitabine.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive GTI-2040 IV continuously on days 1-15 of the first course and days 1-14 of
      all subsequent courses. Patients also receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 2-15.
      Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

          -  Patients must have completed radiation treatment > 4 weeks prior to study entry;
             previously radiated area(s) must not be the only site of disease

          -  All major surgical procedures must be completed > 4 weeks prior to study entry;
             placement of vascular access device or tissue biopsy will not be considered major
             surgery

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and
             for the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect
             she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating
             physician immediately

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

          -  Patients must agree to the placement of a central venous catheter in order to receive
             the continuous infusion treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with only non-measurable disease, defined as all other lesions, including
             small lesions (longest diameter < 20 mm with conventional techniques or < 10 mm with
             spiral CT scan) and truly non-measurable lesions, which include the following:

               -  bone lesions

               -  leptomeningeal disease

               -  ascites

               -  pleural/pericardial effusion

               -  inflammatory breast disease

               -  lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis

               -  abdominal masses that are not confirmed and followed by imaging techniques

               -  cystic lesions

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy, hormone therapy, or radiotherapy within 4 weeks
             (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who
             have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks
             earlier

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents; patients may not have
             received prior GTI-2040

          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to GTI-2040 or to capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil

          -  Patients requiring anticoagulant therapy; low-dose anticoagulant (warfarin 1 mg per
             day) for the primary prophylaxis of venous catheter-associated thrombosis is
             permitted

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because GTI-2040 and capecitabine have
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of
             the mother with GTI-2040 and capecitabine, breastfeeding should be discontinued if
             the mother is treated

          -  Because patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections
             when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy, HIV-positive patients receiving
             combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible
             pharmacokinetic interactions with GTI-2040 or other agents administered during the
             study; appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination
             anti-retroviral therapy when indicated
