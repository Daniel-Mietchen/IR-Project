TITLE:
The Effect of Good Bacteria on Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Diabetics

CONDITION:
Fatty Liver

INTERVENTION:
Probiotic-containing powder

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether probiotics, bacteria that may improve
      liver health, can effectively treat a chronic condition in diabetics that increases fat in
      the liver.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease
      in the United States and is also common in diabetics; unfortunately, research on NAFLD has
      been limited. Safe, inexpensive, and well-tolerated treatments for NAFLD are needed. Recent
      studies indicate that probiotics help to improve fat breakdown in mice. This study will
      evaluate the efficacy of probiotic therapy to reduce fat accumulation in the livers of
      people with NAFLD and diabetes.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive either a
      probiotic-containing mixture or placebo once daily for 6 months. Blood tests, and magnetic
      resonance spectroscopy will be used to assess participants at study start and at study
      completion.
