TITLE:
VA Genetic Tissue Banking

CONDITION:
Tissue Banking

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      This project is a program-wide genetic tissue databank for the Department of Veterans
      Affairs Cooperative Studies Program (CSP). The genetic tissue bank has four components: a
      central repository for DNA and other genetic tissue specimens; a Scientific Advisory
      Committee of individuals with expertise in the genetics and epidemiology of diseases with
      special importance to the VA (including cardiovascular, neurologic, respiratory,
      psychological and other disorders); an Ethics Oversight Committee of individuals with
      expertise in bioethics and the law, as they apply to the collection and use of genetic
      tissue, and a Coordinating Center that administers the tissue bank, coordinates the
      scientific and ethics oversight committees, maintains central access to clinical study data
      linked to the tissue bank, and provides statistical analysis.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Intervention: No intervention.

      Primary Hypothesis: It is feasible and cost-effective to create a CSP-wide facility for
      banking genetic tissue in CSP studies.

      Study Abstract: This is a program-wide genetic tissue databank for the Department of
      Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program (CSP). The study has five components: a central
      repository for DNA and other genetic tissue specimens; a Scientific Advisory Committee of
      individuals with expertise in the genetics and epidemiology of diseases with special
      importance to the VA (including cardiovascular, neurologic, respiratory, psychological and
      other disorders); an Ethical Oversight Committee of individuals with expertise in bioethics
      and the law, as they apply to the collection and use of genetic tissue, A Veteran's Advisory
      Group, and a Coordinating Center administers the tissue bank, coordinates the three
      oversight committees, maintains central access to clinical study data linked to the tissue
      bank, and provides statistical analysis.
