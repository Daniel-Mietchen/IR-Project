TITLE:
This is an Early Study to Investigate the Effect of Gimatecan in Adults With Malignant Glioma.

CONDITION:
Malignant Glioma

INTERVENTION:
Gimatecan (ST 1481)

SUMMARY:

      Gimatecan is Sigma-Tau Research's new, potent, oral Topoisomerase I inhibitor. Drugs in
      this class play a crucial role in destroying DNA replication in tumors. We are conducting
      this study to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose of our compound. In addition, we plan to
      assess the drug's ability to affect the evolution of malignant gliomas, when given as a
      capsule, rather than by intravenous injection.
