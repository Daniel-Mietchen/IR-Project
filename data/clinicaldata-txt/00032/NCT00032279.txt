TITLE:
Research Study of Visilizumab for Treatment of Glucocorticoid- Refractory Graft Versus Host Disease

CONDITION:
Graft-vs-Host Disease

INTERVENTION:
Visilizumab

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this phase II study is to evaluate an investigational monoclonal antibody for
      the treatment of glucocorticoid-refractory Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD). Patients
      diagnosed with GVHD who have not responded satisfactorily to, or are intolerant of,
      treatment with standard agents will be considered for entry. Patients will be allowed to
      continue on their other immunosuppressive drugs at stable doses during the trial. The
      research is being conducted at up to 20 clinical research sites in the US.
