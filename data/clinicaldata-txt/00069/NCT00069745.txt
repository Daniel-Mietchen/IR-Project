TITLE:
Satraplatin in Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer Patients Previously Treated With One Cytotoxic Chemotherapy Regimen

CONDITION:
Prostate Cancer

INTERVENTION:
Satraplatin

SUMMARY:

      PURPOSE:

      The SPARC trial is designed to compare the combination of the investigational oral cytotoxic
      drug, satraplatin, and prednisone, versus prednisone alone as second line chemotherapy in
      patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC).

      TARGET PATIENT POPULATION:

      The SPARC trial is intended for patients who have hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC)
      and whose disease has progressed after treatment with one chemotherapy regimen. Please refer
      to the Eligibility Criteria page for the key inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      WHAT IS SATRAPLATIN:

      Satraplatin is a member of the platinum-based class of chemotherapy drugs. Platinum-based
      drugs have been clinically proven to be one of the most effective classes of anticancer
      therapies. Unlike the currently marketed platinum-based drugs, satraplatin can be given
      orally. Satraplatin is also the only platinum-based drug that has demonstrated efficacy
      against prostate cancer in a randomized trial.

      RATIONALE:

      There are currently no approved chemotherapy drugs for the second line treatment of
      hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC). In a preliminary randomized trial conducted in
      Europe, the combination of satraplatin and prednisone had superior activity compared to
      prednisone alone, for the treatment of HRPC patients who had not previously been treated
      with chemotherapy
