TITLE:
Treatment for Women With Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Related to Childhood Abuse

CONDITION:
Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic

INTERVENTION:
Psychotherapy treatment

SUMMARY:

      This study will compare one- and two-component treatments in women with post-traumatic
      stress disorder (PTSD).
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PTSD is a debilitating and often chronic anxiety disorder with serious psychiatric
      comorbidity. The most common trauma associated with PTSD among women is childhood abuse.
      PTSD related to childhood abuse may cause problems with emotion regulation and interpersonal
      functioning. This study will address three domains of PTSD related to childhood abuse:
      emotion management problems, interpersonal problems, and PTSD symptoms.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to 16 sessions of one of three
      treatments: Skills Training for Affective and Interpersonal Regulation (STAIR), which
      focuses on helping individuals strengthen and build skills in managing feelings and
      improving interpersonal relationships; Modified Prolonged Exposure (MPE), which focuses on
      developing narratives of abuse history and completing an "emotional processing" of the
      trauma in a safe environment; and a combination of STAIR and MPE. Dropout rates and adverse
      effects will be measured.
