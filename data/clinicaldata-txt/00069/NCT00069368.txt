TITLE:
ORWH:SCOR on Sex and Gender Factors Affecting Women's Incontinence

CONDITION:
Urinary Incontinence

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      This study consists of two studies with overlapping cohorts. One is a follow up
      epidemiological study of urinary incontinence, the other is a case control study of lower
      urinary tract dysfunction in women with diabetes.

      Study One:

      Subjects for the study will be a retrospective cohort of 2100 middle-aged and older women
      from a large health maintenance organization who have participated in the Reproductive Risk
      Factor for Incontinence Study at Kaiser (RRISK). The RRISK I study assembled a retrospective
      cohort of long-term female Kaiser Permanente members to determine the association between
      specific childbirth events, hysterectomy, hormone use and urinary incontinence later in
      life. The study also provides descriptive information on urinary incontinence by type, age,
      ethnicity, severity and age of onset.

      Study Two:

      Women with diabetes have a 30-70% increased risk of lower urinary tract dysfunction,
      including lower urinary tract symptoms, urinary incontinence, and ultimately bladder
      cystopathy. This sudy investigates the natural history, risk factors, and possible
      mechanisms of lower urinary tract dysfunction and infection among women with type 2 diabetes
      as compared to women without diabetes.
