SUMMARY:

      Many genes are thought to contribute to rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study will attempt
      to identify genes that may contribute to RA.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      The identification of genes for complex disorders such as RA requires large numbers of
      genetically informative families. This study enrolls people diagnosed with with RA and their
      families.

      This study will enroll 1000 RA patients and their parents. Participants with RA will be
      evaluated at his or her doctor's office or other location convenient for the participant.
      Participants will have a brief phone interview with a study coordinator and a blood sample
      will be obtained. Disease evaluation will be done at one visit and will include confirmation
      of diagnosis, a 28 joint count, joint alignment and mobility score (JAMS) and administration
      of a health assessment questionnaire.
