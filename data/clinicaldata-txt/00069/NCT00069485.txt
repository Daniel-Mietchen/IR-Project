TITLE:
Resistance to HIV Infection

CONDITION:
HIV Infections

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      The immune systems of some individuals may be capable of resisting HIV infection. These
      individuals do not appear to be infected with HIV despite multiple sexual encounters with
      HIV infected partners. This study will examine the immune systems of these individuals to
      determine what factors are responsible for their ability to resist HIV infection.

      Study hypothesis: Some long-term, multiply-exposed seronegative persons have relative
      resistance to HIV infection maintained by T cell responses.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Rare individuals appear naturally resistant to overt HIV-1 infection despite repeated sexual
      exposures. These individuals, referred to as exposed seronegatives (ES), represent a unique
      population in which to evaluate mechanisms by which HIV-1 replication is either controlled
      or aborted. The purpose of the study is to analyze HIV-specific immune responses, both
      cellular and humoral, that exist in seronegative individuals who have experienced multiple
      exposures to HIV by sexual contact.

      This study will follow participants for 2 years. Participants will have 25 study visits
      during the study. Assessments will include HIV tests, viral load measurements, CD4 counts,
      pregnancy tests, and physical exams.
