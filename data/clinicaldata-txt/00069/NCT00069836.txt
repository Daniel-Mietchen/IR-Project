TITLE:
Study Of AVANDAMET With Or Without Insulin In Type II Diabetes Mellitus Patients. AVANDAMET is a Registered Trademark of the GSK Group of Companies.

CONDITION:
Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2

INTERVENTION:
Rosiglitazone/metformin

SUMMARY:

      This study was designed to test the safety and efficacy (how well it works) of AVANDAMET in
      combination with insulin in improving the control of blood sugar when compared with taking
      insulin on its own. AVANDAMET capsules contain a fixed dose of AVANDIA and metformin. Both
      AVANDIA and metformin are medicines which are individually licensed for the treatment of
      type II diabetes mellitus. Because they act in different ways, it is thought that combining
      them may give an increased benefit of treating diabetes and reducing blood sugar.
