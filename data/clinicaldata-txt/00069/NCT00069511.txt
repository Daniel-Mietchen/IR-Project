TITLE:
12 Week Study of Anti-Viral Effect of Oral UT-231B in Non-cirrhotic Hepatitis C Patients who have Failed Interferon-based Therapy.

CONDITION:
Hepatitis C

INTERVENTION:
UT-231B

SUMMARY:

      This is a multi-center study. Neither the study subjects nor the physicians will know what
      treatment an individual subject is receiving. Subjects will be randomly assigned (like
      flipping a coin) to one of five treatment groups. The treatment groups include four
      different dosing groups of active study drug and one group of subjects who will receive
      placebo. A 12 week follow up period occurs after the 12 weeks of dosing. The study endpoint
      is a reduction in Hepatitis C viral load.
