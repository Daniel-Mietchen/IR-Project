TITLE:
Carperitide in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)

CONDITION:
Respiratory Distress Syndrome

INTERVENTION:
recombinant human atrial natriuretic polypeptide

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Carperitide is safe and effective in the
      management of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS is a severe form of acute lung injury. ARDS is
      characterized by an increase in pulmonary vascular permeability resulting from a
      non-cardiogenic cause, leading to an increased vascular water volume, pulmonary
      inflammation, and severe hypoxemia. Conventional therapy for ARDS is primarily respiratory
      management by mechanical ventilation using positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).
      Mechanical ventilation is the major management concern in patients with ARDS, due to its
      higher risk of infections and morbidity. Treatment with Carperitide may reduce time on the
      ventilator by reducing pulmonary edema and by improving gas exchange. The results of
      Carperitide studies in animals and humans support the idea that the hormone will be
      effective in managing the acute pulmonary complications and hypoxemia seen in ARDS.
