TITLE:
Open Study of CEP-701 in Patients With Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia With FLT-3 Mutation

CONDITION:
Leukemia, Myeloid

INTERVENTION:
CEP-701 60mg

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to determine the response rate of patients with refractory,
      relapsed or poor risk AML expressing FLT-3 activating mutations, when administered CEP-701
      at a dosage of 60 mg 2 times a day.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      This is an open-label study of CEP-701 in patients with refractory, relapsed, or poor risk
      AML expressing FLT-3 activating mutations. Patients who meet eligibility criteria will be
      enrolled at a dosage of 60 mg orally 2 times a day for 28 days (1 cycle). Upon completion of
      cycle 1, the dosage may be increased to 80mg 2 times a day or decreased to 40 mg 2 times a
      day, dependent upon response to 60 mg dosage.
