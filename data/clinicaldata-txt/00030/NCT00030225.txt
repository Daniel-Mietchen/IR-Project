TITLE:
Phase 2 Evaluation of the ELAD System in the Management of Acute Liver Failure

CONDITION:
Fulminant Hepatic Failure

INTERVENTION:
ELAD

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to determine if treatment with the ELAD Bioartificial Liver
      Assist Device is beneficial to patients in Acute Liver Failure either as a bridge to liver
      transplant or bridge to native liver recovery.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Current treatment with modalities in Acute Liver Failure still carry unacceptable morbidity
      and mortality. It is hoped that by intervening with ELAD a patient will have an opportunity
      to be bridged to transplant or to avoid transplantation and to have their native liver
      recover.
