TITLE:
GM-CSF in Patients With Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis

CONDITION:
Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis

INTERVENTION:
GM-CSF (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, sargramostim)

SUMMARY:

      This is a study to determine the efficacy and safety of granulocyte-macrophage
      colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF, sargramostim) administered subcutaneously to patients
      with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP).
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PAP is a rare lung disease characterized by accumulation of surfactant phospholipids and
      proteins within the lungs. There is no specific pharmacologic therapy for PAP and the
      current practice of lung lavage under general anesthesia is invasive and has limitations.
      Although it is unknown if the anti GM-CSF antibody is related to the disease pathogenesis,
      observations suggest a role for GM-CSF in lung homeostasis as well as in the pathogenesis of
      PAP.

      Patients will receive subcutaneous GM-CSF or placebo once a day and will be followed on an
      outpatient basis at 2 weeks, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 months after initiation of therapy.
      Clinical response will determine dosing schedule and will be evaluated by symptom scores,
      gas exchange data, and chest radiographs.
