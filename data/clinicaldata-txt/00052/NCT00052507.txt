TITLE:
Bortezomib in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Recurrent Colorectal Cancer

CONDITION:
Colorectal Cancer

INTERVENTION:
bortezomib

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Bortezomib may interfere with the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes
      necessary for cancer cell growth.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bortezomib in treating patients who
      have metastatic or recurrent colorectal cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy of bortezomib, in terms of response rate and stable disease
           rate, in patients with recurrent or metastatic colorectal cancer.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the time to progression and response duration in patients treated with this
           drug.

        -  Determine whether there is a relationship between levels of transcription factors NF
           kappa B and HIF-1 alpha and clinical outcome in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-41 patients will be accrued for this study within 2-4
      months.
