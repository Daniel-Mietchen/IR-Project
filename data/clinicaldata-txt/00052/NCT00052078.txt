TITLE:
Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders (CAMS)

CONDITION:
Anxiety Disorders

INTERVENTION:
Sertraline

SUMMARY:

      This 9-month study will compare the effectiveness of the medication sertraline (Zoloft),
      cognitive-behavioral therapy, the combination of these treatments, and placebo for youth
      with anxiety disorders.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Anxiety disorders are among the most common conditions affecting children and adolescents.
      These disorders impair school, social, and family functioning. When left untreated, they
      also put children at risk for major depression and substance abuse in late adolescence and
      adulthood. Effective treatments that alleviate symptoms and prevent long-term morbidity and
      mortality associated with childhood-onset anxiety disorders are needed.

      During Phase I of this two-phase study, participants are randomly assigned to receive
      sertraline (Zoloft), cognitive behavioral therapy, a combination of these treatments, or a
      placebo for 12 weeks. Phase II involves a 6-month maintenance period for participants that
      respond to any of the three active treatments.
