TITLE:
Telephone-Based Support for Caregivers of Patients With Dementia

CONDITION:
Dementia

INTERVENTION:
Cognitive-Behavioral Family Systems Intervention

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to develop an effective, low-cost, telephone-based intervention
      to reduce anxiety, depression, and feelings of burden and stress in caregivers of patients
      with dementia. This study will also determine whether the intervention can alter the course
      of dementia.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Caregivers are randomized to receive either telephone-based intervention or standard medical
      care. Both groups receive a resource packet containing information about caring for someone
      with dementia and a list of local resources. Caregivers in the intervention group also
      receive a series of telephone calls over 12 months, during which education, emotional
      support, and training in problem-solving skills are provided by trained therapists.
      Caregivers in the standard care group receive no additional psychosocial intervention.
      Participants are assessed pre-treatment, mid-treatment (6 months), post-treatment, and at a
      3-month follow-up.
