TITLE:
Therapy for Depressed Elders With Thought Problems

CONDITION:
Depression

INTERVENTION:
Problem Solving Therapy

SUMMARY:

      This study will compare the effectiveness of Problem Solving Therapy and Brief Supportive
      Therapy in treating elderly patients with major depression and thought problems.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Patients who suffer from a combination of major depression and executive dysfunction
      symptoms often respond poorly to treatment with antidepressants. It is important, therefore,
      to find effective alternative therapies to treat these symptoms.

      Patients are randomly assigned to receive 12 sessions (1 session/week for 12 weeks) of
      either PST or BST. Following treatment, patients are followed for 6 months to determine
      functional and clinical outcomes. Depression scales, disability scales, and scales that
      measure problem solving skills are used to assess patients.
