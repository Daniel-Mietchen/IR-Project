TITLE:
Irbesartan in Heart Failure With Preserved Systolic Function (I-Preserve)

CONDITION:
Congestive Heart Failure

INTERVENTION:
Irbesartan

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this clinical research study is to learn if Irbesartan is superior to placebo
      in reducing mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in subjects with heart failure with
      preserved systolic function. The safety of this treatment will also be studied.
