TITLE:
Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With HER2/Neu Positive or Negative Stage IV Breast Cancer or Other HER2/Neu Positive Cancers

CONDITION:
Breast Cancer

INTERVENTION:
allogeneic GM-CSF-secreting breast cancer vaccine

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from gene-modified tumor cells may make the body build an immune
      response to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in
      different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Interferon
      alfa may interfere with the growth of tumor cells. Combining vaccine therapy with
      cyclophosphamide and interferon alfa may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining vaccine therapy with
      interferon alfa and cyclophosphamide in treating patients who have stage IV breast cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of vaccine therapy comprising an
           allogeneic (non-self) tumor cell line transfected with the sargramostim (GM-CSF) gene
           combined with low-dose interferon alfa and low-dose cyclophosphamide in patients with
           stage IV breast cancer or other solid tumors.

        -  Determine the clinical response, time to progression, and survival of patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  Correlate clinical response with immunological response in patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive low-dose cyclophosphamide IV once 2-3 days before each tumor
      vaccine. Patients then receive tumor vaccine comprising HER2/neu-positive allogeneic
      (non-self) breast cancer cells transfected with the sargramostim (GM-CSF) gene intradermally
      (ID) on day 1. Patients also receive low-dose interferon alfa ID approximately 48 and 96
      hours after each tumor vaccine. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 3 vaccinations and then
      monthly for 3 vaccinations in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 2 weeks and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-24 patients will be accrued for this study.
