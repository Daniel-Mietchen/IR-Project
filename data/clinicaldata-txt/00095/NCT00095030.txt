TITLE:
Study Comparing Muraglitazar With Glimepiride in Type 2 Diabetics Who Are Not Controlled With Metformin Alone

CONDITION:
Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2

INTERVENTION:
muraglitazar

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this clinical research study is to learn whether a muraglitazar-metformin
      combination is at least as effective as a glimepiride-metformin combination to treat type 2
      diabetics who are not sufficiently controlled with metformin alone. The safety of this
      treatment will also be studied.
