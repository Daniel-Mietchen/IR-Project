TITLE:
Investigation of V520 in an HIV Vaccine Proof-of-Concept Study (V520-023)

CONDITION:
AIDS

INTERVENTION:
Trivalent MRKAd5 HIV-1 gag/pol/nef (1.5x10^10 ad-vg/dose)

SUMMARY:

      This study will test the safety and efficacy of an investigational Human Immunodeficiency
      Virus (HIV) vaccine. Efficacy will be measured by either prevention of HIV infection or
      control of HIV viral load in subjects who become HIV infected.

      On September 18, 2007 the Protocol V520-023 DSMB (Data & Safety Monitoring Board) reviewed
      data from a planned interim analysis. These data demonstrated that the investigational
      vaccine candidate was not effective, and all vaccinations in the study were halted.

      Participants were encouraged to continue to come to the clinic for scheduled visits and
      ongoing risk reduction counseling since the vaccine was not effective.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      No further treatment was given in V520-023, however participants were followed. V520-023
      protocol ended earlier than originally planned per protocol and participants (HIV infected
      and uninfected) had the option of participating in an observational long term follow up
      protocol called V520-030/HVTN 504, which served as an extension of V520-023 and would
      continue through the end of 2009.
