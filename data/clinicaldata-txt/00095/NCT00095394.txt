TITLE:
Irbesartan/Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) Combination Therapy as First Line Treatment for Severe Hypertension

CONDITION:
Hypertension

INTERVENTION:
Irbesartan/HCTZ

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this clinical research is to learn if severe hypertension can be better
      controlled by initially treating with a combination of drugs (Irbesartan/HCTZ), in patients
      who are unlikely to achieve blood pressure (B/P) control with only one drug. In addition,
      the study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of the drugs.
