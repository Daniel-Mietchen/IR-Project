TITLE:
Etanercept for Non-Infectious Lung Injury Following Bone Marrow Transplantation

CONDITION:
Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult

INTERVENTION:
etanercept

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of etanercept, and define the
      toxicity, when administered to patients with acute non-infectious lung injury (idiopathic
      pneumonia syndrome, IPS) and with subacute pulmonary dysfunction after allogeneic stem cell
      transplantation.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Over the last 2 decades, allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) has emerged as an
      important treatment option for a number of malignant and non-malignant disorders.
      Unfortunately, pulmonary dysfunction remains a frequent and severe complication of
      allogeneic BMT. One of the main chemicals felt to cause lung damage is Tumor Necrosis Factor
      (TNF). Etanercept is an experimental drug that attempts to block TNF lung damage. Patients
      will undergo blood tests, x-rays, and a bronchoscopy with broncho-alveolar lavage prior to
      treatment with etanercept to check for infection. If no infection is evident after 24 hours,
      the etanercept will be started and administered twice weekly for 4 weeks by subcutaneous
      injection. There will be weekly blood tests and bronchoscopy after the last drug dose.
