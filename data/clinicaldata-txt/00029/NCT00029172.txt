TITLE:
Treatment for Post-Stroke Depression

CONDITION:
Stroke

INTERVENTION:
case management

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a program of education, medicine, and monitoring
      for the treatment of depression after a stroke.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      This trial will compare outcomes in depressed patients receiving the
      Activate-Initiate-Monitor (AIM) intervention vs. those receiving usual care, and will also
      compare outcomes in depressed and non-depressed stroke survivors. Patients are screened for
      depression 1 to 2 months post-stroke. Patients with depression are then randomized to the
      AIM intervention or control group. Patients without depression are also enrolled at the same
      time and are matched by hospital site to the depressed patients.

      The AIM intervention is a 3-part program consisting of activating or educating the patient
      and his/her family about post-stroke depression, instituting treatment for depression, and
      monitoring antidepressant treatments for side effects, efficacy, and compliance. Control
      patients are evaluated and treated with usual care by their physicians. Patients without
      depression do not receive the intervention but complete the same assessments on the same
      schedule as the patients with depression.
