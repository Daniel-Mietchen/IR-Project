TITLE:
Rheopheresis Blood Filtration Study for the Treatment of Dry Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)

CONDITION:
Macular Degeneration

INTERVENTION:
Rheopheresis blood filtration

SUMMARY:

      AMD is a progressive disease of the retina which is nourished by a network of tiny blood
      vessels. There is evidence to suggest that the flow of nutrients to the retina is impaired
      in patients with AMD. Rheopheresis blood filtration uses blood filters that deplete excesses
      of large proteins, fats and other substances from the blood, improving blood flow to the
      macula, potentially improving vision.
