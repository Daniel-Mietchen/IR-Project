TITLE:
Safety and Efficacy Study of Etanercept (Enbrel) In Children With Systemic Onset Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis

CONDITION:
Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis

INTERVENTION:
Enbrel

SUMMARY:

      Rationale: etanercept inhibits the effects of tumor necrosis factor, which plays an
      important role in the progression of rheumatoid arthritis. A study of children with
      polyarticular course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis showed that Enbrel had efficacy and was
      generally well tolerated in children ages 4-17 who had moderately to severely active disease
      and who failed treatment with one or more disease modifying antiarthritic drugs. The
      children in the study may have had arthritis onset of pauciarticular, polyarticular, or
      systemic nature. Systemic onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (SOJRA) may result in
      approximately one-third of patients having significant long-term disability. Purpose: the
      Phase 4 study is designed to further define the safety and efficacy of etanercept in those
      children with SOJRA.
