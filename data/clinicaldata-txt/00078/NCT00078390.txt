TITLE:
Study of S-3304 in Patients With Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer

CONDITION:
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer

INTERVENTION:
S-3304

SUMMARY:

      A study to measure the safety and effectiveness of S-3304 when given in combination with
      conventional chemo-radiation therapy in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung
      cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      A two part study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of S-3304 in combination with standard
      therapy in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The first part of the
      study is a Phase I design to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose of S-3304 when given in
      combination with radiation and paclitaxel/carboplatin chemotherapy that is appropriate for
      further evaluation. The second part of the study is a randomized Phase II design to evaluate
      the efficacy of recommended S-3304 dose in combination with chemo-radiation.
