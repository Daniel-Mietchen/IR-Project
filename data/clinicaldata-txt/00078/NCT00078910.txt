TITLE:
Neoadjuvant Exisulind in Treating Patients Who Are Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy for Stage II or Stage III Prostate Cancer

CONDITION:
Prostate Cancer

INTERVENTION:
exisulind

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as exisulind, work in different ways to stop
      tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving a chemotherapy drug before
      surgery may shrink the tumor so that it can be removed.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well neoadjuvant exisulind works in treating
      patients who are undergoing radical prostatectomy for stage II or stage III prostate cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the effect of neoadjuvant exisulind vs no neoadjuvant treatment on apoptosis in
           patients with stage II or III prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the effect of this drug (preoperatively) on surrogate endpoint biomarkers
           (i.e., prostate-specific antigen, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia,
           MIB-1, and DNA ploidy) in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, controlled study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups
      based on the treating physician.

        -  Control group: Patients undergo radical prostatectomy only.

        -  Treatment group: Patients receive oral exisulind once daily for 4 weeks. Patients then
           undergo radical prostatectomy.

      Patients are followed at 1 month.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 130 patients (65 per group) will be accrued for this study
      within approximately 10-12 months.
