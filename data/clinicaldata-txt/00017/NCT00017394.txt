TITLE:
Bevacizumab Plus Vinorelbine in Treating Patients With Stage IV Breast Cancer

CONDITION:
Male Breast Cancer

INTERVENTION:
bevacizumab

SUMMARY:

      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bevacizumab combined with vinorelbine in
      treating patients who have stage IV breast cancer. Monoclonal antibodies such as bevacizumab
      can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them
      without harming normal cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor
      cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining monoclonal antibody with
      chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the complete and partial response rates in patients with stage IV breast cancer
      treated with concurrent bevacizumab and vinorelbine.

      II. Determine the side effects of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the time to
      disease progression in patients treated with this regimen.

      IV. Determine the time on study (a reflection of time to progression, treatment-related side
      effects, and patient preference) of patients treated with this regimen.

      V. Assess urine protein/creatinine ratio and serum complement levels as screening measures
      for renal injury in patients treated with bevacizumab.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes once every other week and vinorelbine IV
      over 6-10 minutes once weekly for 8 weeks. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for 4 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with complete or
      partial response or stable disease after completion of the fourth course may receive
      additional courses of concurrent bevacizumab and vinorelbine administered once every other
      week or may continue therapy on the schedule as above.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 56 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
