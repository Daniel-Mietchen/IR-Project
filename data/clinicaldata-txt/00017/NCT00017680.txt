TITLE:
Study of High-Dose Melphalan and Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation in Patients With Primary Light Chain Amyloidosis

CONDITION:
Amyloidosis

INTERVENTION:
Melphalan

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response, disease-free survival, and overall survival of
      patients with primary light chain amyloidosis treated with high-dose melphalan and
      autologous stem cell transplantation.

      II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients may receive induction chemotherapy before study entry. Patients
      then receive filgrastim (G-CSF) or another growth factor for 4-6 days as peripheral blood
      stem cell (PBSC) mobilization. PBSC (or bone marrow) is harvested over 2-3 days.

      Patients receive high-dose melphalan IV over 30 minutes twice daily on days -2 and -1. PBSC
      and/or bone marrow is reinfused on day 0. Patients receive G-CSF beginning on day 0 and
      continuing until blood counts recover. This course may be repeated 4-12 weeks later.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then annually for 5 years.
