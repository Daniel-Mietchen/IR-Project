TITLE:
Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Recurrent Cancer

CONDITION:
Breast Cancer

INTERVENTION:
MVF-HER-2(628-647)-CRL 1005 vaccine

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy in treating patients
      who have metastatic or recurrent cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the optimum biologic dose of MVF-HER-2(628-647)-CRL 1005 vaccine
      that will induce anti-HER-2 antibody in patients with metastatic or recurrent cancer. II.
      Characterize the nature and severity of toxicity of this drug in these patients. III.
      Document any clinical responses to this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive MVF-HER-2(628-647)-CRL 1005
      vaccine intramuscularly on days 1 and 29. Cohorts of 5 patients receive escalating doses of
      MVF-HER-2(627-647)-CRL 1005 vaccine until at least 2 of 5 patients experience dose-limiting
      toxicity. Patients are followed on days 43 and 57 and every 2 months for at least 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 5-25 patients will be accrued for this study.
