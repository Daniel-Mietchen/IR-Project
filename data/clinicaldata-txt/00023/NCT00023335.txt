TITLE:
TBTC Study 22: Efficacy of Once-Weekly Rifapentine and Isoniazid in Treatment of Tuberculosis

CONDITION:
Pulmonary Tuberculosis

INTERVENTION:

      Secondary Objectives:

      To compare the clinical and bacteriologic failure rates of the two study regimens at the
      completion of the study phase therapy.

      To compare the clinical and bacteriologic response rates for the two study regimens among
      patients who began study phase therapy with signs and symptoms of tuberculosis or cultures
      positive for M. tuberculosis.

      To compare the toxicity associated with the two study regimens by comparing discontinuation
      rates due to adverse events and occurrence rates of signs and symptoms associated with
      adverse events during study phase therapy.

      To compare mortality rates of the two study regimens. To compare the rates of completion of
      therapy within 22 weeks for the two study regimens.

      To compare the rate of development of drug-resistant tuberculosis in the two study regimens
      among study patients classified as treatment failures or relapses.

      To compare all of the above performance characteristics for the two study regimens in a
      small subset of HIV seropositive patients.

      To compare attitudes and beliefs about participation in this study between patients who
      complete study therapy and those who fail to complete study therapy.
