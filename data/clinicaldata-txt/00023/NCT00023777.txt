TITLE:
S0112 Cytarabine and Daunorubicin in Treating Older Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia

CONDITION:
Leukemia

INTERVENTION:
filgrastim

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining cytarabine and daunorubicin
      in treating older patients who have acute myeloid leukemia that has not been previously
      treated.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy of cytarabine and daunorubicin as induction chemotherapy in
           older patients with previously untreated non-M3 acute myeloid leukemia.

        -  Determine the frequency and severity of toxic effects of this regimen in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive induction chemotherapy comprising daunorubicin IV continuously over days
      1-3 and cytarabine IV continuously over days 1-7. Patients may be treated with a second
      course of induction chemotherapy beginning on day 19 if remission is not achieved at that
      time. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) or sargramostim (GM-CSF) IV or subcutaneously
      daily beginning on day 15 and continuing until blood counts recover.

      Patients who achieve remission after the first or second course of induction chemotherapy
      receive consolidation chemotherapy comprising daunorubicin IV continuously over days 1 and 2
      and cytarabine IV continuously over days 1-5. Beginning no earlier than day 19, patients
      receive a second course of consolidation chemotherapy.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then
      annually for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30-55 patients will be accrued for this study within 8-9
      months.
