TITLE:
TBTC Study 23C: Pharmacokinetics of Intermittent Rifabutin and Isoniazid With Daily Efavirenz

CONDITION:
HIV Infections

INTERVENTION:
Rifabutin

SUMMARY:

      The aim of this trial is to study the efavirenz-rifabutin interaction. Thus, this trial will
      enroll patients with HIV and tuberculosis co-infections who are receiving a rifabutin-based
      regimen and who plan to begin an antiretroviral regimen containing efavirenz dosed at 600 mg
      daily. Enrollment in TB Trials Consortium Study 23 is not a requirement for participation in
      this study.

      Primary Objective:

      To compare the pharmacokinetics of rifabutin at 600 mg twice a week in combination with
      efavirenz 600 mg daily to the pharmacokinetics of rifabutin 300 mg twice a week without
      efavirenz.
