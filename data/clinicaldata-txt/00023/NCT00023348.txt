TITLE:
TBTC Study 23A: Pharmacokinetics of Intermittent Isoniazid and Rifabutin in HIV-TB

CONDITION:
HIV Infections

INTERVENTION:
Isoniazid

SUMMARY:

      Primary Objectives:

      1) To determine the proportion of patients with HIV-related tuberculosis who have abnormal
      pharmacokinetic parameters for isoniazid and rifabutin.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To determine risk factors for abnormal pharmacokinetic parameters for isoniazid and
           rifabutin.

        2. To evaluate the correlation between pharmacokinetic parameters of isoniazid and
           rifabutin and the occurrence of toxicity attributed to antituberculous therapy.

        3. To evaluate the correlation between pharmacokinetic parameters of isoniazid and
           rifabutin and the efficacy of TB therapy.

        4. To define and correlate phenotypic INH acetylator status with the results of genotypic
           acetylator data obtained in the parent trial.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      This study will seek to enroll every eligible patient enrolled in TBTC Study 23. Consenting
      patients will be asked to undergo measurements of isoniazid (if receiving), rifabutin and
      25-OH desacetyl rifabutin levels at a time point in the study when steady state rifabutin
      levels are expected to have been achieved (at least two weeks following the start of
      rifabutin).
