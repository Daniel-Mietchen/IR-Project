TITLE:
Radiation Therapy Plus Celecoxib, Fluorouracil, and Cisplatin in Patients With Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer

CONDITION:
Cervical Cancer

INTERVENTION:
celecoxib

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. Giving radiation therapy in different ways and combining it with chemotherapy may kill
      more tumor cells. Celecoxib may slow the growth of cervical cancer by stopping blood flow to
      the tumor.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of radiation therapy plus celecoxib,
      fluorouracil, and cisplatin in treating patients who have locally advanced cervical cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine treatment-related toxicity rates in patients with locally advanced cervical
           cancer treated with external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy concurrently with
           celecoxib, fluorouracil, and cisplatin.

        -  Determine whether this regimen increases locoregional control rates, distant control,
           disease-free survival, and overall survival in these patients.

        -  Determine whether first-failure patterns in patients treated with this regimen are
           changed compared to historical controls.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo external beam pelvic radiotherapy once daily five days a weeks for 5 weeks
      beginning on day 1. Within 8 weeks, patients undergo low-dose or high-dose brachytherapy.
      Patients also receive concurrent chemotherapy comprising fluorouracil IV continuously over
      days 2-5, 23-26, and 44-47 and cisplatin IV over 4 hours on days 1, 22, and 43. Oral
      celecoxib is administered twice daily beginning on day 1 and continuing for 12 months.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months
      for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 83 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.5 years.
