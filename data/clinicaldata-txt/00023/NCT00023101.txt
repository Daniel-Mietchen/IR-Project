TITLE:
Lead, Endocrine Disruption and Reproductive Outcomes

CONDITION:
Lead Poisoning

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      This prospective cohort study of 400 lead exposed and 400 non-lead exposed women and their
      husbands assesses endocrine dysfunction and adverse reproductive outcomes. Residing in two
      study areas in Shenyang, China, the women are married, 20 and 34 years of age, never
      smokers, have obtained permission to have a child, and have attempted to become pregnant
      over the course of the study. Lead exposure is defined by lead levels in blood samples
      collected at the baseline survey (both women and their husbands), first and second
      trimesters, and at delivery (both maternal and cord blood). Endocrine dysfunction is
      monitored by urinary hormone metabolites including follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH),
      luteinizing hormone (LH), estrone conjugates (E1C), and pregnanediol-3-glucuronide (PdG).
      Reproductive endpoints include menstrual disturbance, time to conception, spontaneous
      abortion, preterm delivery, and low birth weight.
