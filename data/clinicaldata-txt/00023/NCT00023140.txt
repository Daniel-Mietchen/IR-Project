TITLE:
Collaborative Study of 1,3 Butadiene Biomarkers

CONDITION:
Cancer

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      Butadiene is a suspect human carcinogen to which most people are exposed daily. Exposures
      are difficult to measure by air sampling. This study examines the relationship between air
      levels and several biomarkers of exposure. Biomarkers are substances analyzed in human
      tissues or waste products. Adducts are materials formed when a chemical reacts with a
      biological material. In this study we are looking at biomarkers in the blood: hemoglobin and
      DNA adducts, and urinary metabolites. If a strong relationship is found then the amounts of
      biomarkers in a person's blood or urine can tell us how much they have been exposed. The
      tests are being conducted on petrochemical workers who have a wide range of exposures to
      butadiene. An international group of investigators is conducting the study.
