TITLE:
Gefitinib in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Persistent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer or Primary Peritoneal Cancer

CONDITION:
Ovarian Cancer

INTERVENTION:
gefitinib

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Biological therapies such as gefitinib may interfere with the growth of the tumor
      cells and may slow the growth of ovarian epithelial cancer or primary peritoneal cancer.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of gefitinib in treating patients who
      have recurrent or persistent ovarian epithelial cancer or primary peritoneal cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the antitumor cytostatic activity of gefitinib, in terms of 6-month
           progression-free survival, in patients with persistent or recurrent ovarian epithelial
           or primary peritoneal carcinoma.

        -  Determine the nature and degree of toxicity in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the partial and complete response rates in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the duration of progression-free and overall survival in patients treated
           with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral gefitinib once daily. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 22-60 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2
      years.
