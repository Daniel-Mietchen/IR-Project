TITLE:
DX-8951f in Treating Women Who Have Advanced or Recurrent Cancer of the Cervix

CONDITION:
Cervical Cancer

INTERVENTION:
exatecan mesylate

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of DX-8951f in treating women who have
      advanced or recurrent cancer of the cervix.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of DX-8951f in women with advanced or recurrent
           squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix.

        -  Evaluate the quantitative and qualitative toxic effects of this regimen in these
           patients.

        -  Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive DX-8951f IV over 30 minutes daily for 5 days. Courses repeat every 21 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 37 patients will be accrued for this study.
