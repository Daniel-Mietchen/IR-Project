TITLE:
Phase III Randomized Study of SYNSORB Pk in Children With E. Coli-Associated Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome

CONDITION:
Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome

INTERVENTION:
SYNSORB Pk

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effect of SYNSORB Pk therapy on mortality and frequency of
      severe extrarenal complications observed in children with acute stage E. coli-associated
      hemolytic uremic syndrome.

      II. Determine the effect of SYNSORB Pk therapy on the need for the duration of dialysis in
      these patients.

      III. Determine the effect of SYNSORB Pk therapy on the recovery of renal function and
      resolution of urinary abnormalities in these patients.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study.
      Patients are randomized to receive either SYNSORB Pk or placebo.

      Patients receive oral SYNSORB Pk or placebo three times daily for 7 days. Patients are
      followed on days 7, 14, 28, and 60 after discharge from the hospital.
