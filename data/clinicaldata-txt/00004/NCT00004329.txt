TITLE:
Study of Alpha-2 Adrenergic Receptor Dysfunction in Regional Lipoatrophy

CONDITION:
Lipodystrophy

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response in plasma norepinephrine concentration and plasma
      glycerol to the agonist (clonidine) and the antagonist (yohimbine) of the alpha-2 adrenergic
      receptor in 6 patients with regional lipoatrophy and in 6 controls.

      II. Determine the full sequence of the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor structural gene in
      genomic DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Antihypertensives are held, beginning 3 days before the first study day.

      An oral challenge is administered as follows: clonidine on day 1, yohimbine on day 2. The
      order of administration is reversed in alternate subjects.

      Timed measurements of norepinephrine, glycerol, and free fatty acids follow each challenge.
      Structural gene sequencing is evaluated for each participant.
