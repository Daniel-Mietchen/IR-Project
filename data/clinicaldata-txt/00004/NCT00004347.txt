TITLE:
Phase II Study of Dietary Cholesterol for Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome

CONDITION:
Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome

INTERVENTION:
diet

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Examine the intestinal absorption of dietary cholesterol in patients with
      Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome.

      II. Measure the effect of dietary cholesterol on plasma sterol composition. III. Quantify
      basal cholesterol synthesis, turnover of cholesterol and 7-dehydrocholesterol, and the
      effects of dietary cholesterol on these parameters.

      IV. Identify fecal bile acid excretion quantitatively and qualitatively in these patients.

      V. Compare the incorporation of deuterated water into plasma cholesterol,
      7-dehydrocholesterol, and other intermediates, and assess the effect of dietary cholesterol
      on this incorporation.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      Patients are treated with 2 dietary regimens for 1 to 3 weeks: high cholesterol and
      cholesterol-free. Cholesterol is provided in the form of egg yolk. The absorption and
      metabolism of cholesterol are evaluated with plasma and fecal studies. Deuterated water is
      given to patients followed by analysis of deuterium in plasma cholesterol and other
      intermediates, including 7-dehydrocholesterol.
