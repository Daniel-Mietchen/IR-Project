TITLE:
Phase I/II Randomized Study of Hydroxyurea With or Without Clotrimazole in Patients With Sickle Cell Anemia

CONDITION:
Sickle Cell Anemia

INTERVENTION:
clotrimazole

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare the efficacy of hydroxyurea with or without clotrimazole in terms of limiting the
      severity of anemia and the rate of hemolysis in patients with sickle cell anemia.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to one of two
      treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive oral hydroxyurea and oral clotrimazole daily for 12 months.

      Arm II: Patients receive oral hydroxyurea daily for 12 months. Patients are followed at 6
      weeks.
