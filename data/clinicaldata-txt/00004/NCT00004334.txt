TITLE:
Study of Depression, Peptides, and Steroids in Cushing's Syndrome

CONDITION:
Cushing's Syndrome

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Study the relationship between dysregulation of the
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and disorders of mood, vegetative function, and
      cognition in patients with Cushing's disease.

      II. Identify subgroups of patients with Cushing's disease who differ in the presence and
      severity of the depressive syndrome, and uncover HPA axis dysregulation differences among
      them using corticotropin-releasing hormone, metyrapone, and dexamethasone challenge testing.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: All patients receive a psychiatric evaluation at baseline, as well as
      assessments of plasma adrenocorticotropin, beta lipotropin, beta endorphin, and cortisol,
      and urinary cortisol. Peptide and steroid assays are performed, alone and in response to
      corticotropin-releasing hormone, metyrapone, and dexamethasone. Patients are given sleep
      electroencephalograms at baseline and 1 year following treatment.

      A weight maintenance diet is prescribed for all patients.
