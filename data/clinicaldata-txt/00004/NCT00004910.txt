TITLE:
Endoscopic Placement of Metal Stents in Treating Patients With Cancer- Related Duodenal Obstruction

CONDITION:
Colorectal Cancer

INTERVENTION:
bowel obstruction management

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: The use of endoscopy to place metal stents in the duodenum is less invasive than
      surgery for treating cancer-related duodenal obstruction and may have fewer side effects and
      improve recovery.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of endoscopic placement of metal stents
      in treating patients who have cancer-related obstruction of the duodenum.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the objective response and clinical outcome in patients with duodenal
           obstruction secondary to malignancy treated with enteral Wallstents.

        -  Evaluate the efficacy and safety of this treatment in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the quality of life of these patients after enteral Wallstent placement.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo enteral Wallstent placement through an endoscope under
      fluoroscopic guidance into the duodenum.

      Quality of life is assessed at 48 hours and 6 months after procedure.

      Patients are followed at 48 hours, 30 days, 6 months, and then yearly thereafter until
      death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
