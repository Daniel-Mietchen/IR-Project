TITLE:
Study of Tauroursodeoxycholic Acid for Hepatobiliary Disease in Cystic Fibrosis

CONDITION:
Cystic Fibrosis

INTERVENTION:
tauroursodeoxycholic acid

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the optimum dose of tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) required to
      achieve maximal bioavailability for patients with cystic fibrosis-associated liver disease.

      II. Compare optimized doses of TUDCA with ursodiol (ursodeoxycholic acid; UDCA) for effects
      on biliary bile acid composition and metabolism, serum biochemistries, fat absorption, and
      fat-soluble vitamin status in these patients.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Objective I: This part of the study is a dose-response study to determine
      the optimal dose of tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA). Twenty-four patients are randomized
      to receive one of three different doses of TUDCA for 3 months.

      Objective II: This part of the study is a double-blind crossover study to compare optimized
      doses of TUDCA with optimized doses of ursodiol in 15 patients stratified according to age
      (less than 10 vs 10-20 vs more than 20 years). Patients are randomized to receive either
      TUDCA or ursodiol orally for an initial 3 month period, followed by a 3 month washout period
      in which no drug is administered. Patients then receive the alternate drug for 3 months.
