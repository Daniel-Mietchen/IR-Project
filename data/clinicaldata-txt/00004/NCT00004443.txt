TITLE:
Study of NTBC for Tyrosinemia I

CONDITION:
Tyrosinemia I

INTERVENTION:
NTBC

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the safety and efficacy of NTBC in children with tyrosinemia I.

      II. Evaluate the effects of NTBC on survival, rate of neurologic crises, improvement in
      renal tubular damage, reduction in the need for liver transplantation, and reduction in the
      development of hepatocarcinoma in these patients.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to age at onset of symptoms (0-2 months
