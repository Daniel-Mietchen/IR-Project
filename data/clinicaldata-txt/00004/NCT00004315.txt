TITLE:
Phase II Pilot Study to Compare the Bioavailability of Buffered, Enteric-Coated Ursodiol With Unmodified Ursodiol for Chronic Cholestatic Liver Disease and Cystic Fibrosis-Associated Liver Disease

CONDITION:
Cystic Fibrosis

INTERVENTION:
ursodiol

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the bioavailability of polymer-coated and buffered ursodiol
      (ursodeoxycholic acid) to unmodified ursodiol in patients with cystic fibrosis-associated
      liver disease or chronic cholestatic liver disease.

      II. Compare the differences in pruritus, weight gain, and liver function for both
      treatments.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      Patients are sequentially treated with 2 formulations of ursodeoxycholic acid: unmodified
      ursodiol (Actigall) and buffered, enteric-coated ursodiol (Ursocarb). There is a 24-hour
      washout between each 4-week course of therapy.
