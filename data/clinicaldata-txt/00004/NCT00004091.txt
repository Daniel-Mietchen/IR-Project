TITLE:
Detection of Biomarkers in Abnormal Cervical Cells in Women With Abnormal Pap Test Results

CONDITION:
Cervical Cancer

INTERVENTION:
Papanicolaou test

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Examining biomarkers in abnormal cervical cells may improve the ability to detect
      these cells and plan effective treatment.

      PURPOSE: Diagnostic trial to detect specific biomarkers in abnormal cervical cells in women
      who have abnormal Pap test results.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the detection of transferrin receptor, epidermal growth factor
      receptor, and the MaTu-MN protein in exfoliated cervical epithelial cells from women with
      abnormal Pap test using fluorescent labeled antibody probe vs histology.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo a Pap test and a colposcopy. Cervical epithelial cells are
      collected from the most abnormal appearing lesion. Cells are examined for molecular markers
      using a fluorescent antibody test. The presence or absence of these markers is compared to
      results of the Pap test and the histology of the cells.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 months.

        following: Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) Low grade squamous
        intraepithelial lesion (LGSIL) High grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HGSIL) Visible
        lesion on cervix by colposcopy
