TITLE:
Endoscopic Placement of Metal Stent in Patients With Cancer-Related Bowel Obstruction

CONDITION:
Colorectal Cancer

INTERVENTION:
bowel obstruction management

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: The use of endoscopy to place a metal stent in the large intestine is less
      invasive than surgery for treating cancer-related bowel obstruction and may have fewer side
      effects and improve recovery.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of endoscopic placement of a metal
      stent in treating patients who have cancer-related bowel obstruction.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the objective response and clinical outcome in patients with colonic
           obstruction secondary to malignancy treated with enteral Wallstents.

        -  Evaluate the efficacy and safety of this treatment in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the quality of life of these patients after enteral Wallstent placement.

      OUTLINE: All patient undergo a colonoscopy, followed by placement of an enteral Wallstent
      through an endoscope under fluoroscopic guidance into the large intestine.

      Quality of life is assessed at 48 hours and 6 months after the procedure.

      Patients are followed at 48 hours, 30 days, 6 months, and then yearly thereafter until
      death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
