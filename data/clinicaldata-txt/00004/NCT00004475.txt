TITLE:
Genetic Linkage Study for Hereditary Pancreatitis

CONDITION:
Pancreatitis

INTERVENTION:
genetic testing

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Establish linkage in families with hereditary pancreatitis between the phenotype and a
      chromosomal locus (loci) that contains the responsible gene.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a genetics study. Blood samples are collected from patients and
      family members. DNA is extracted from the blood and used for genotypic analysis and linkage
      analysis.

      Patients do not necessarily receive the results of the genetic testing and the results do
      not influence the type or duration of treatment.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: N/A to N/A
Criteria:

        -  Diagnosis of hereditary pancreatitis with confirmation of phenotype by: Onset of pain
             before age 20 Amylase elevation at least 2 times normal Surgical or postmortem
             confirmation of pancreatitis Unequivocal evidence of pancreatic exocrine
             insufficiency in the absence of trauma, alcohol abuse, elevated serum lipids, or
             other known causes

          -  Family member of a patient diagnosed with hereditary pancreatitis
