TITLE:
Study of Hypercortisolism in Cushing's Syndrome and Stress-Induced Pseudo-Cushing's Syndrome

CONDITION:
Cushing's Syndrome

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine whether Cushing's syndrome and stress-induced pseudo-Cushing's syndrome can be
      differentiated by evaluating endogenous corticotropin-releasing hormone activity.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients undergo a 30-hour infusion of deuterated cortisol with peripheral
      and petrosal vein measurements of adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) and
      corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). Patients also have a 2-day, low-dose dexamethasone
      suppression test.

      Patients with ACTH tumors are referred for pituitary surgery as indicated. Patients without
      Cushing's syndrome are entered as controls. During scheduled radiologic procedures, these
      subjects undergo ACTH and CRH sampling from the petrosal vein or cavernous sinus following a
      deuterated cortisol infusion.
