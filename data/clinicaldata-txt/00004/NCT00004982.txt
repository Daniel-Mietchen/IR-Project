TITLE:
Combination Iron Chelation Therapy

CONDITION:
Iron Overload

INTERVENTION:
Combination Iron Chelation Therapy

SUMMARY:

      Patients with beta-thalassemia (Cooley's Anemia) continue to suffer from the
      transfusion-induced iron overload due to the inadequacies of current iron-chelation therapy.
      Compliance with the use of the only FDA-approved drug for removing excess iron from patients
      (Desferal) continues to be a major problem despite convincing evidence that it markedly
      reduces morbidity and prolongs life. The full potential of iron-chelation therapy will not
      be realized until an orally-effective drug is available. This small trial is testing the
      premise that a combination of drugs as a new approach to iron chelation therapy may reduce
      side effects and increase efficacy. If both drugs can be given orally, there may be a better
      chance of finding a suitable alternative to Desferal. Several combinations of experimental
      iron chelating drugs are being used in this trial.
