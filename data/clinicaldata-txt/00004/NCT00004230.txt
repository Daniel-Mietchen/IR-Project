TITLE:
Captopril in Treating Patients Undergoing Bone Marrow or Stem Cell Transplantation

CONDITION:
Cancer

INTERVENTION:
captopril

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Captopril may protect the lungs from the side effects of bone marrow or stem cell
      transplantation.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of captopril to lessen
      the side effects in patients who are undergoing bone marrow or stem cell transplantation
      following chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine if captopril can block or prevent lung injury in patients
      undergoing autologous bone marrow or stem cell transplantation following cyclophosphamide
      and total body radiotherapy or high dose chemotherapy. II. Determine a series of surrogate
      lung injury prediction markers for monitoring patients undergoing therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to preparative
      regimen (high dose chemotherapy versus cyclophosphamide and total body radiotherapy).
      Patients are randomized into one of two treatment arms. All patients undergo a conditioning
      regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide daily on days -6 and -5 and total body radiotherapy
      on day -4 through -1, or high dose chemotherapy per transplantation protocol. Arm I:
      Patients receive oral captopril 2 to 3 times daily beginning on the first day of the
      conditioning regimen and continuing until day 100 post autologous bone marrow or stem cell
      transplantation. Arm II: Patients receive no captopril while undergoing conditioning
      therapy. Patients are followed at 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.
