TITLE:
Phase III Randomized, Double-Blind Study of Potassium Phosphate Vs Potassium Citrate for Absorptive Hypercalciuria

CONDITION:
Hypercalciuria

INTERVENTION:
potassium citrate

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the ability of a slow-releasing formulation of neutral potassium
      phosphate to correct hypercalciuria and prevent recurrent stone formation in patients with
      absorptive hypercalciuria.

      II. Evaluate the safety of this treatment. III. Compare the efficacy of potassium phosphate
      to that of potassium citrate.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind study. Patients are stratified by
      participating institution.

      Patients receive potassium phosphate or potassium citrate tablets twice a day for 3 years.
