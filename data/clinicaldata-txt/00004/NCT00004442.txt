TITLE:
Study of Bile Acids in Patients With Peroxisomal Disorders

CONDITION:
Infantile Refsum's Disease

INTERVENTION:
chenodeoxycholic acid

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effectiveness of oral bile acid therapy with cholic acid,
      chenodeoxycholic acid, and ursodeoxycholic acid in patients with peroxisomal disorders
      involving impaired primary bile acid synthesis.

      II. Determine whether suppression of synthesis of atypical bile acids and enrichment of bile
      acid pool with this regimen is effective in treating this patient population and improving
      quality of life.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients receive oral cholic acid and oral chenodeoxycholic acid on day 1.
      On day 4, patients receive oral cholic and ursodeoxycholic acids. Patients are assessed at 3
      and 6 months for liver function response, neurologic status, and nutritional status.

      Patients receive treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects are
      observed.
