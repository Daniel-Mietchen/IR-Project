TITLE:
Phase II Randomized Study of Tin Mesoporphyrin for Neonatal Hyperbilirubinemia

CONDITION:
Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency

INTERVENTION:
tin mesoporphyrin

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the efficacy of preventive vs. therapeutic tin mesoporphyrin in
      direct Coombs' test-positive ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn and glucose-6-phosphate
      dehydrogenase deficiency in infants living in Greece.

      II. Assess the safety of tin mesoporphyrin in high-risk newborns.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by gestational age and sex, and randomly assigned
      in pairs per stratum.

      One group receives a preventive dose of tin mesoporphyrin. Another group receives a
      therapeutic dose of tin mesoporphyrin according to the plasma bilirubin concentration.

      Patients in either group may be treated concurrently with phototherapy or exchange
      transfusion if clinically indicated.
