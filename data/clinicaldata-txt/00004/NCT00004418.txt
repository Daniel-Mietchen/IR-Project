TITLE:
Effect of Glycerol Trierucate on Clinical Course of Adrenoleukodystrophy

CONDITION:
Adrenoleukodystrophy

INTERVENTION:
glyceryl trierucate

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the clinical efficacy of combination glyceryl trierucate and
      glyceryl trioleate (Lorenzo's Oil) therapy in boys with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy.

      II. Compare the frequency and severity of neurological disability of study patients with

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is an open label study. Patients must follow dietary instructions as
      provided by the investigator. Patients receive 2-4 tablespoons of a mixture of glyceryl
      trierucate and glyceryl trioleate oil once daily. Patients complete a neuropsychological
      scoring scale questionnaire to measure neurological disability. Patients undergo physical
      examinations including magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the
      head.

      Patients are followed monthly for 6 months, then every 3 months until death.
