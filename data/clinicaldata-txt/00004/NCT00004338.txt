TITLE:
Study of Zinc for Wilson Disease

CONDITION:
Wilson Disease

INTERVENTION:
zinc acetate

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Establish the safety and efficacy of extended maintenance zinc therapy in 200
      patients with Wilson disease.

      II. Establish further the role of zinc in the prophylactic treatment of presymptomatic
      patients by increasing the current cohort from 80 to at least 100 patients.

      IV. Establish further the role of zinc therapy in children with Wilson disease.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
