TITLE:
Docetaxel and Irinotecan in Treating Patients With Advanced Cancer of the Esophagus or Stomach

CONDITION:
Esophageal Cancer

INTERVENTION:
docetaxel

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining docetaxel and irinotecan in
      treating patients who have advanced cancer of the esophagus or stomach.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective tumor response rate in patients with advanced
      adenocarcinoma of the lower esophagus, esophagogastric junction, and gastric cardia treated
      with docetaxel and irinotecan. II. Determine time to progression and overall survival of
      patients treated treated with this regimen. III. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen
      in these patients. IV. Assess treatment response in these patients by determining the
      prevalence of dysphagia, anorexia, and swallowing ability at diagnosis and during treatment
      with this regimen.

        lower esophagus, esophagogastric junction, or gastric cardia that is considered
        unresectable and for which no curative therapy exists No other conventional forms of
        therapy available that would offer a reasonable chance of cure or significant palliation
        Gastric cardia is defined as no greater than 5 cm from the esophagogastric junction into
        the stomach Measurable disease At least 1 lesion that can be accurately measured in at
        least 1 dimension as at least 20 mm No nonmeasurable lesions only, including: Bone lesions

        resection of original tumor allowed Prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy allowed No prior
        chemotherapy for recurrent or metastatic disease No other concurrent chemotherapy
        Endocrine therapy: Not specified Radiotherapy: Prior adjuvant radiotherapy after complete
        resection of original tumor allowed Prior neoadjuvant radiotherapy allowed At least 4
        weeks since prior radiotherapy No prior radiotherapy for recurrent or metastatic disease
