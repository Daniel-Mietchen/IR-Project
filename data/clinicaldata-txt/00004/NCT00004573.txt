TITLE:
Kinetics of Response of Cytomegalovirus With Ganciclovir Treatment Using Quantitative Real-Time PCR

CONDITION:
Cytomegalovirus Infections

INTERVENTION:
ganciclovir

SUMMARY:

      The overall purpose of this research is to develop and use a blood test to better understand
      how quickly the viral drug ganciclovir works to clear infection with the CMV virus
      (Cytomegalovirus) when it occurs. This test will potentially let doctors know early in the
      course of therapy when a virus is not responding well to the therapy and could therefore be
      resistant to the drug. The target population of this study will be primarily kidney and lung
      transplant patients with CMV detected in the blood, although other patients may also be
      included if they meet criteria. The study will be divided into two phases. Phase I will
      evaluate a small number of exploratory patients initiating ganciclovir therapy and will
      require frequent blood sampling to obtain detailed information regarding the kinetic
      response of the virus to therapy. This information will be analyzed to help guide decisions
      regarding the number and frequency of blood samples needed in the larger phase II portion of
      the study. Strains will be characterized using phenotypic and genotypic methods to determine
      the presence or absence of mutations potentially responsible for the resistance.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
NONE

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 18 Years to N/A
Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients affiliated with Barnes-Jewish Hospital with CMV blood infection requiring
             antiviral therapy

          -  All patients will have a positive qualitative CMV PCR or viral culture before
             starting therapy

          -  Patients will receive treatment with ganciclovir at a dose and duration to be
             determined by the provider

          -  It is anticipated that most subjects will be organ transplant recipients but this is
             not a requirement of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Critically ill patients

          -  Patients with profound leukopenia or abnormal renal function that make a change in
             the antiviral drug dosage likely during the duration of the study

          -  Anemia (HGB < 8 g/dl) that would contraindicate the extra blood draws required by
             this study

          -  Problems with vascular access that would interfere with obtaining blood samples
             required by this study

          -  Residence outside of the St. Louis metropolitan area during the period of ganciclovir
             therapy

          -  Patients who are unable to provide informed consent because of diminished capacity
             related to illness, dementia, or other reasons
