TITLE:
Purification of Testis-Stimulating Factor in Precocious Puberty

CONDITION:
Precocious Puberty

INTERVENTION:
leuprolide

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES:

      Purify and characterize a testis-stimulating factor in the blood of adult volunteers who had
      precocious puberty as boys.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Subjects are treated for 2 months with depot injections of leuprolide
      acetate every 4 weeks and testosterone replacement every 2 weeks. Hormone levels are tested
      every other week.

      If luteinizing hormone and follicular-stimulating hormone levels are at or below detection
      on day 56, blood is drawn for a testis-stimulating factor bioassay and subsequent factor
      purification and characterization.

      Volunteers are asked to repeat this 2-month procedure no more than 2 times every 12 months.
