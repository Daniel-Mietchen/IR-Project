TITLE:
Leuprolide in Determining the Cause of Gonadotropin Deficiency

CONDITION:
Hypogonadism

INTERVENTION:
gonadotropin releasing hormone

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: The body's response to one injection of leuprolide may provide more information
      than the standard test for gonadotropin deficiency in determining whether the cause of
      gonadotropin deficiency is related to the hypothalamus or the pituitary gland.

      PURPOSE: Randomized double-blinded clinical trial to study the effectiveness of leuprolide
      in determining the cause of gonadotropin deficiency.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind study. Patients are randomized to
      receive leuprolide acetate or gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) first, then cross over
      to receive the other test.

      Patients receive one subcutaneous injection of leuprolide acetate or GnRH, then have blood
      samples drawn periodically. One month later, patients receive the other test.

      Another cohort of patients are randomized to receive leuprolide acetate once daily on days
      0, 4, and 8, or days 0, 5, and 10.

      Patients are followed for up to 2 years.
