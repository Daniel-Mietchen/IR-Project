TITLE:
Chemotherapy Plus Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer That Cannot Be Surgically Removed

CONDITION:
Lung Cancer

INTERVENTION:
cisplatin

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor
      cells. Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy plus radiation therapy
      in treating patients who have stage III non-small cell lung cancer that cannot be surgically
      removed.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicity of
      gemcitabine and paclitaxel in combination with radiotherapy in patients with locally
      advanced stage IIIA or IIIB non-small cell lung cancer. II. Assess response rate, duration
      of response, disease free survival and failure in this patient population on this regimen.
      III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine and paclitaxel during the
      chemoradiotherapy phase.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of gemcitabine. Induction phase: Patients receive
      gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 2 courses. Chemoradiotherapy phase: Patients receive
      paclitaxel IV over 1 hour and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes beginning 2 hours into
      paclitaxel infusion on day 1 of weeks 6, 9, and 12. Patients undergo conventional chest
      radiotherapy on Monday though Friday for weeks 6-11. Cohorts of 3-5 patients receive
      escalating doses of gemcitabine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The
      MTD is defined as the dose at which at least 2 of 5 patients experience dose limiting
      toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 17 patients will be accrued for this study.
