TITLE:
Phase II Study of Ribose, Uridine, and Thymidine for a Complex Syndrome Involving Excessive 5'-Nucleotidase Activity

CONDITION:
5'-Nucleotidase Syndrome

INTERVENTION:
ribose

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy of oral ribose in patients with a complex
      5'-nucleotidase syndrome who have not received uridine (UR) and thymidine (TDR).

      II. Evaluate the efficacy of UR/oral ribose and UR/TDR. III. Evaluate the efficacy of oral
      ribose given in combination with UR/TDR.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Newly identified patients receive ribose daily for 8 weeks. Patients who
      improve continue therapy. If improvement then reaches a plateau, uridine (UR) and thymidine
      (TDR) are added to the regimen.

      Patients who receive no benefit after 8 weeks of ribose are treated with UR/TDR. Patients
      who improve after 8 weeks of this combination continue therapy.

      Ribose is added to the treatment regimen for patients on UR/TDR at entry. At maximal
      improvement, TDR and UR are sequentially tapered.
