TITLE:
Phase II Pilot Study of Extracorporeal Phototherapy for Epidermolysis Bullosa Acquisita

CONDITION:
Epidermolysis Bullosa Acquisita

INTERVENTION:
methoxsalen

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate immunomodulation with extracorporeal photochemotherapy (ECP) in
      patients with epidermolysis bullosa acquisita.

      II. Investigate the effect of ECP on lymphocyte activity.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Oral methoxsalen (8-MOP) is administered 90 minutes prior to
      leukapheresis. Blood mononuclear cells are exposed to ultraviolet A light for 3 hours, then
      returned to the patient. The process is repeated on 2 successive days.

      Patients are re-treated every 3 to 4 weeks for a total of 6 treatments or until the skin has
