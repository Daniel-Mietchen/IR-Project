TITLE:
Phase III Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study of Intravenous Immune Globulin for Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy

CONDITION:
Polyradiculoneuropathy, Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating

INTERVENTION:
Immune globulin

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare the response of previously untreated patients with chronic inflammatory
      demyelinating polyneuropathy to intravenous immune globulin vs. placebo.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind study. The first group receives
      intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) on days 1, 2, and 21; the second group receives an
      intravenous placebo on the same schedule.

      Patients in either group may receive IVIG (same dosage as first group) after day 42.

      Concurrent steroids and other immune globulin preparations are prohibited.

Gender: All
Age: 15 Years to N/A
Criteria:

        PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA:

        --Disease Characteristics-- Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP),
