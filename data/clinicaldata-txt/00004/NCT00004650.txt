TITLE:
Phase III Randomized Study of the Effect of Postmenopausal Estrogen Replacement Therapy on Alveolar Bone Loss

CONDITION:
Osteoporosis

INTERVENTION:
conjugated estrogens

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Quantify periodontal alveolar bone loss rates in postmenopausal women.

      II. Evaluate the effects of estrogen on alveolar bone loss rates in these patients.

      III. Determine whether changes in periodontal bone mass relate to bone mass changes in other
      skeletal sites in these patients.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study. Patients are
      randomly assigned to receive placebo or conjugated estrogens and, if no prior hysterectomy,
      medroxyprogesterone. Patients also receive calcium supplementation therapy daily for 3
      years.

      Participants in the placebo group may be removed from study if bone loss exceeds 5% per
      year.

      A study duration of 3 years is anticipated.

Age: N/A to N/A
Criteria:

        PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA:

          -  Women postmenopausal for at least 2 years

          -  At least 10 teeth for which radiographic measurements can be obtained, i.e.: Not
             severely tilted Not so closely spaced that interproximal bone is thin Not in
             positions of restricted access
