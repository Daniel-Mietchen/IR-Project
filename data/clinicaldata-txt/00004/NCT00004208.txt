TITLE:
Antithymocyte Globulin and Cyclosporine in Treating Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome

CONDITION:
Myelodysplastic Syndromes

INTERVENTION:
ATG + CSA

SUMMARY:

      The main objective of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of intensive
      immuno-suppression with ATG + CSA versus best supportive care in patients with transfusion
      dependent low and intermediate risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      This trial will answer the question whether immuno-suppression improves hematopoesis and
      reduces transfusion requirements analogous to patients with aplastic anemia as the
      short-term outcome, and whether immuno-suppression accelerates leukemic transformation and
      influences survival as the long-term outcome.

      Primary endpoint: best response (CR + PR) rate at month 6

        blasts and the patient refusing or not eligible for the MDS high risk protocol (EORTC
        06961)
