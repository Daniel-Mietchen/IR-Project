TITLE:
Study of the Regulation of Parathyroid Hormone Secretion in Pseudohypoparathyroidism

CONDITION:
Pseudohypoparathyroidism

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES:

      Determine the relationship between serum calcium concentrations and parathyroid hormone
      secretion in patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      Patients are tested for parathyroid hormone response following sequential graded intravenous
      infusions of sodium citrate and calcium gluconate. Assays include ionized calcium and intact
      parathyroid hormone.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 12 Years to N/A
Criteria:

        PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA:

        --Disease Characteristics-- Pseudohypoparathyroidism, i.e.: Renal resistance to
        parathyroid hormone OR Albright hereditary osteodystrophy No other illness unless related
        to pseudohypoparathyroidism No pregnant women
