TITLE:
Randomized Study of L-Baclofen in Patients With Refractory Trigeminal Neuralgia

CONDITION:
Trigeminal Neuralgia

INTERVENTION:
L-baclofen

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy of L-baclofen in patients with refractory trigeminal
      neuralgia.

      II. Evaluate the safety and tolerance of L-baclofen in these patients.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel study.

      Patients are randomized to receive either L-baclofen or placebo orally at increasing daily
      doses for 1 week. Patients then continue to receive the maximum dosage acceptable for a 1
      week maintenance period.

      Patients, thereafter, may enroll in a long term open label study with L-baclofen.

      Patients are followed at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.

        or frontal pain lasting a few seconds to less than 2 minutes - Pain has at least 4 of the
        following characteristics: Distribution along one or more divisions of the trigeminal
        nerve Sudden, intense, sharp, superficial, stabbing, or burning quality Pain intensity

        carbamazepine --Prior/Concurrent Therapy-- No concurrent medication for trigeminal
        neuralgia other than carbamazepine, phenytoin, and neurontin Concurrent medication for
        other conditions allowed Concurrent medication must be on stable dose(s) --Patient
        Characteristics-- Hepatic: No significant hepatic disease Renal: No significant renal
        disease Neurological: No evidence of progressing neurological disorder (e.g., intracranial
