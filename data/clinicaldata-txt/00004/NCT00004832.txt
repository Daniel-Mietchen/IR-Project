TITLE:
Randomized Study of 3,4-Diaminopyridine for Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome

CONDITION:
Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome

INTERVENTION:
3,4-diaminopyridine

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the safety and effectiveness of 3,4-diaminopyridine (DAP) in the
      treatment of patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS).

      II. Determine the side-effects and benefits associated with DAP.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study. Patients are
      randomized to receive 3,4-diaminopyridine (DAP) or placebo orally 3 times daily for 5 days,
      after which treatment is discontinued and patients are observed for at least 24 hours. At
      the end of the blinded study, patients may then elect to take open label DAP orally 3 times
      daily for 6 months; those who do so are monitored for clinical effects and side effects for
      at least 6 months.

Criteria:

        PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA:

        --Disease Characteristics-- Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) based on weakness
        that predominates in proximal limb muscles and electromyography (EMG) findings of small
        amplitude muscle responses to nerve stimulation, which decrease further during nerve
        stimulation at 5 Hz and which increase at least 2-fold after maximum voluntary contraction
        of the muscle for 10-20 seconds Quantified Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) clinical score at least
        5 --Prior/Concurrent Therapy-- Chemotherapy: No concurrent chemotherapy Endocrine therapy:
        Patients receiving immunosuppressants must be on the same dose of medication for at least
        3 months prior to study entry Radiotherapy: No concurrent radiotherapy Surgery: No
        concurrent surgery Other: Patients receiving cholinesterase inhibitors must discontinue
        the medication at study entry if possible, or else be on the same dose of medication for
        at least 1 month prior to study entry --Patient Characteristics-- Hematopoietic: No
        significant hematologic disease Hepatic: No significant hepatic disease Renal: No
        significant renal disease Cardiovascular: No cardiac arrhythmia or significant cardiac
        disease Neurologic: No seizure disorder Other: Not pregnant Negative pregnancy test
        required of fertile women Effective contraception required of fertile women
