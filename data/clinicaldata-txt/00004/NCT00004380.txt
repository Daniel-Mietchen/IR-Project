TITLE:
Phase II Study of Recombinant Relaxin for Progressive Systemic Sclerosis

CONDITION:
Systemic Sclerosis

INTERVENTION:
relaxin

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether parenteral relaxin improves skin tightness, Raynaud's
      phenomenon, digital morbidity, and digital ulcers in a patient with progressive systemic
      sclerosis (scleroderma).

      II. Determine whether relaxin decreases collagen production by fibroblasts in vivo and
      cultured from skin biopsies.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a compassionate use study. The patient is treated with
      subcutaneous injections of recombinant relaxin for approximately 12 months. If clinically
      indicated, therapy may be extended.
