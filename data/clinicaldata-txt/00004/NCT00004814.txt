TITLE:
Phase III Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study of Copolymer 1 for Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis

CONDITION:
Multiple Sclerosis

INTERVENTION:
copolymer 1

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare tolerance to and therapeutic impact of copolymer 1, a mixture of synthetic
      polypeptides, with placebo in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind study. Patients are stratified by
      participating institution.

      One group receives copolymer 1, a mixture of synthetic polypeptides composed of 4 amino
      acids, subcutaneously each day for 2 years.

      The other group receives an injection of placebo daily for 2 years.
