TITLE:
Oxaliplatin and Gemcitabine in Treating Patients With Advanced Cancer

CONDITION:
Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific

INTERVENTION:
gemcitabine hydrochloride

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of oxaliplatin and gemcitabine in treating
      patients who have advanced cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicities of
      gemcitabine in combination with oxaliplatin in patients with advanced malignancies. II.
      Determine the pharmacokinetics of oxaliplatin and gemcitabine in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose escalation study of gemcitabine. Patients receive
      oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8.
      Treatment continues every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gemcitabine in combination
      with a fixed dose of oxaliplatin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The
      MTD is defined as the dose at which no more than 1 of 6 patients experiences dose limiting
      toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-36 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
