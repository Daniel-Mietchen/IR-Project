TITLE:
Study of Genetic and Molecular Defects in Primary Immunodeficiency Disorders

CONDITION:
X-Linked Agammaglobulinemia

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Identify the molecular defects responsible for primary immunodeficiency
      disorders.

      II. Explore the mutations within each syndrome to better understand the genetics of these
      disorders.

      III. Study the function of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome proteins (WASP). IV. Design methods
      to identify carriers and for prenatal diagnosis. V. Explore new avenues for therapy.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients are studied systematically to determine the extent of their
      immune deficiency and to confirm a specific diagnosis. Patients with a known
      immunodeficiency syndrome are studied in detail to identify the gene mutation, to assess the
      effect of the mutation on the gene product, and to establish cell lines for further in vitro
      assessment of the genetic defect. The function of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome proteins (WASP)
      in hematopoietic cells is studied.

      Family members of patients with X-linked disorders are studied to identify carrier females.
