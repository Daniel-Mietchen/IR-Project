TITLE:
Phase II Study of the Effect of Leuprolide Acetate and Spironolactone on Insulin Resistance in Hyperandrogenic Women With Polycystic Ovarian Disease or Hyperandrogenism Insulin Resistance Acanthosis Nigricans Syndrome

CONDITION:
Acanthosis Nigricans

INTERVENTION:
leuprolide acetate

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate insulin resistance in thin and obese hyperandrogenic women with
      polycystic ovarian disease or hyperandrogenism insulin resistance acanthosis nigricans
      syndrome and in thin and obese controls, using an estimation of tissue sensitivity to
      insulin.

      II. Evaluate the effect of androgen suppression with leuprolide acetate and spironolactone
      on insulin secretion and resistance.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Participants are treated with subcutaneous leuprolide acetate followed by
      oral spironolactone. Each treatment is administered daily for 6 weeks, with a 6-week washout
      between drugs.

      Patients and controls are alternately assigned to begin treatment with leuprolide acetate or
      spironolactone.
