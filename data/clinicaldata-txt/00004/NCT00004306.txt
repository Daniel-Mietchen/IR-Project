TITLE:
Clinical and Molecular Correlations in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 10 (SCA10)

CONDITION:
Hereditary Ataxia

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Clinically evaluate members from families with a dominantly inherited ataxia
      and collect blood, skin and muscle samples for detailed molecular studies.

      II. Perform detailed clinical evaluations on patients with recessively inherited ataxias.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Participants undergo a comprehensive clinical and molecular evaluation.
      Studies include: neurologic evaluation, including magnetic resonance imaging and nerve
      conduction studies; ophthalmologic exam; audiologic exam, including auditory brain stem
      evoked response; DNA extraction from blood, skin and muscle; genotype phenotype correlation.

      A neuropathologic evaluation is conducted postmortem, when possible.
