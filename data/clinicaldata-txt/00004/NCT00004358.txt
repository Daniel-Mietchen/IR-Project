TITLE:
Phase II Study of Calcitonin for Tumoral Calcinosis

CONDITION:
Calcinosis

INTERVENTION:
calcitonin

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether intermittent, long-term, subcutaneous administration of
      calcitonin increases phosphaturia, reduces hyperphosphatemia, and increases intact
      parathyroid hormone levels in patients with tumoral calcinosis.

      II. Determine whether calcitonin reduces or prevents tumor recurrence. III. Determine
      whether hyperphosphatemia abolishes the normal circadian pattern of serum phosphorus.

      IV. Determine how repetitive calcitonin administration alters the biochemical markers of
      bone metabolism in osteopenic patients with tumoral calcinosis.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients are treated with subcutaneous injections of salmon calcitonin
      every 3 weeks. Ondansetron premedication and intravenous hydration are also administered.

      Patients are followed for disease progression and tumor recurrence.
