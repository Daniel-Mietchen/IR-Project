TITLE:
Radiolabeled Monoclonal Antibody Therapy Plus Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation in Treating Patients With Lymphoma or Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia

CONDITION:
Leukemia

INTERVENTION:
filgrastim

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies can locate cancer cells and deliver
      cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Peripheral stem cell
      transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were destroyed by monoclonal
      antibody therapy used to kill cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of radiolabeled monoclonal antibody
      therapy plus peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have lymphoma or
      Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia that has not responded to previous therapy.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicity of
      radioimmunotherapy using high dose yttrium Y 90 humanized anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody LL2
      (Y90 MOAB hLL2) followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in
      patients with B cell lymphomas or Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. II. Determine the organ
      and tumor dosimetry for comparison to clinical measurement of toxicity and antitumor
      responses in these patients. III. Determine magnitude and duration of human anti-humanized
      LL2 antibody (HAhLL2) or anti-DOTA response in these patients. IV. Evaluate the extent and
      duration of antitumor response to this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      prior treatment (high dose chemotherapy with transplantation vs low dose chemotherapy with
      radioimmunotherapy (RAIT) vs low dose chemotherapy without RAIT). Patients receive
      filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) daily for 5 days and undergo harvest of peripheral
      blood stem cells (PBSC). If an adequate number of CD34+ cells are not harvested, autologous
      bone marrow may be used. Patients undergo pretherapy imaging with indium In 111 monoclonal
      antibody MN-14 (In111-MN-14) IV on day -7. If at least 1 tumor site is targeted, patients
      receive high dose yttrium Y 90 humanized anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody LL2 (Y90 MOAB hLL2)
      IV for up to 50 minutes on day 0. PBSC or bone marrow is reinfused approximately 7-14 days
      following infusion of Y90 MOAB hLL2. Patients also receive G-CSF SC daily until 3 days after
      blood counts have recovered. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of Y90 MOAB
      hLL2 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are
      followed weekly for 2 months, monthly for 6 months, and then every 6 months for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
