TITLE:
Studies in Porphyria I: Characterization of Enzyme Defects

CONDITION:
Porphyria

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Characterize enzyme defects in patients with known or suspected porphyria and
      their family members.

      II. Determine whether selected patients are eligible for other porphyria research protocols.

      III. Provide blood, urine, and fecal samples from well characterized patients and their
      family members to investigators studying the nature of specific mutations in genes for heme
      biosynthetic pathway enzymes.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: All patients are evaluated for porphyria type and factors contributing to
      the clinical expression of their particular form of the disease. Testing includes
      erythrocyte porphobilinogen deaminase, erythrocyte protoporphyrin, plasma porphyrins, and
      urinary and fecal porphyrins and precursors.

      Selected patients are entered into other porphyrin research protocols in this and other
      institutions, including analysis of DNA to identify specific mutations in genes for heme
      biosynthetic pathway enzymes.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: N/A to N/A
Criteria:

        -  Suspected or confirmed porphyria

          -  Adults, children, and family members eligible
