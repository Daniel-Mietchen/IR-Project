TITLE:
Bone Marrow Transplantation in Treating Children With Sickle Cell Disease

CONDITION:
Sickle Cell Anemia

INTERVENTION:
cyclosporine

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Sickle cell disease is an inherited disorder in which abnormal, crescent-shaped
      red blood cells interfere with the ability of the blood to carry oxygen through the body and
      can cause severe pain, stroke, and organ damage. Bone marrow transplantation, is a procedure
      in which the soft, sponge-like tissue in the center of bones producing white blood cells,
      red blood cells, and platelets is replaced by bone marrow from a another person. Bone marrow
      transplantation may be an effective treatment in relieving the symptoms of sickle cell
      disease.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of bone marrow transplantation in
      treating children who have sickle cell disease.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients undergo total body irradiation on
      day 0, followed by allogeneic bone marrow transfusion. Patients also receive fludarabine IV
      daily and cyclosporine IV twice a day on days -1 to 1. Patients then receive oral
      cyclosporine on days 1-90, and oral mycophenolate mofetil twice a day on days 0-27.

      Patients are followed for 100 days, monthly for 6 months and then annually for 2 years.
