TITLE:
Phase II Pilot Study of Octreotide, a Somatostatin Octapeptide Analog, for Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage in Hormone-Refractory Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia and Senile Ectasia

CONDITION:
Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia

INTERVENTION:
octreotide

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the efficacy of octreotide, a somatostatin octapeptide analog, in decreasing
      gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with hormone-refractory hereditary hemorrhagic
      telangiectasia or senile ectasia.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients are treated with subcutaneous injections of octreotide twice a
      day. The dose is adjusted based on response.

      If there is no requirement for transfusions or intravenous iron for 4 weeks and the
      hemoglobin is greater than 10 mg/dL, therapy is continued for 1 year. If there is no
      decrease in bleeding after 10 weeks, the patient is removed from study.

        hemorrhage determined within past year --Prior/Concurrent Therapy-- Disease
        hormone-refractory --Patient Characteristics-- No octreotide sensitivity
