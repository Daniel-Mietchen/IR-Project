TITLE:
Chemotherapy Plus Biological Therapy Followed By Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation in Treating Patients With Hematologic Cancer

CONDITION:
Leukemia

INTERVENTION:
anti-thymocyte globulin

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell
      transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill
      more cancer cells. Sometimes the transplanted cells are rejected by the body's normal
      tissues. Antithymocyte globulin may prevent this from happening.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy plus biological therapy
      followed by peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have hematologic
      cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effect of nonmyeloablative chemotherapy followed by allogeneic
      peripheral blood stem cell transplantation on hematopoietic recovery in patients with
      hematologic malignancies. II. Determine the toxicities of this regimen in these patients.
      III. Determine the frequency of mixed hematopoietic chimerism in these patients after this
      therapy. IV. Determine the efficacy and toxicity of donor leukocyte infusions at relapse in
      these patients. V. Determine the response rates and survival of these patients after this
      therapy. VI. Determine the immune reconstitution of patients undergoing this therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days -9 to -5, cyclophosphamide
      IV over 1 hour on day -5, and antithymocyte globulin IV over 10 hours on days -5 to -2.
      Allogeneic peripheral blood stem cells are infused on day 0. Patients who achieve complete
      remission (CR) and then relapse or patients who achieve less than a CR before day 60 receive
      donor leukocyte infusions (DLI) over 30 minutes. DLI are repeated as necessary for
      persistent disease. Patients are followed at 1, 3, and 6 months, then at 1 and 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 18 Years to 60 Years
Criteria:

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically proven hematologic malignancy for which there is
        no standard curative therapy, including, but not limited to: Low grade non-Hodgkin's
        lymphoma (NHL) Mantle cell lymphoma Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (stage II-IV)
        Myelodysplastic syndrome, including: Refractory anemia (RA) with ringed sideroblasts RA
        with excess blasts (RAEB) RAEB in transformation Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia Multiple
        myeloma OR Histologically proven hematologic malignancy that has failed 1 prior therapy OR
        is at high risk for relapse, including, but not limited to: Intermediate grade NHL High
        grade NHL Hodgkin's disease Acute lymphoblastic lymphoma Acute myelogenous leukemia OR
        Histologically proven chronic myelogenous leukemia in chronic or accelerated phase, with
        the following risk factors that preclude eligibility for standard allogeneic peripheral
        blood stem cell transplantation: Older age Poor performance status Healthy, partially
        related HLA 5/6 or 6/6 serologic match donor available A new classification scheme for
        adult non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ. The terminology of "indolent" or
        "aggressive" lymphoma will replace the former terminology of "low", "intermediate", or
        "high" grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses the former terminology.
