TITLE:
Study of Pituitary Size and Function in Familial Dwarfism of Sindh

CONDITION:
Growth Hormone Deficiency

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess pituitary size and anatomic configuration by magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) in 4 affected dwarfs in the province of Sindh, Pakistan.

      II. Evaluate ultradian growth hormone (GH) secretory patterns in 4 affected dwarfs.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Pituitary size and anatomy and growth hormone response are evaluated.

      All patients undergo MRI of the pituitary fossa on day 1. On day 2, homozygous patients
      receive a slow infusion of normal saline with blood sampling every 10 minutes.
