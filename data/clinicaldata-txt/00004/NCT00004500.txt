TITLE:
Phase III Randomized Study of Lucinactant in Full Term Newborn Infants With Meconium Aspiration Syndrome

CONDITION:
Meconium Aspiration

INTERVENTION:
Lucinactant

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES:

      Evaluate the safety and efficacy of lucinactant administered by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)
      in the treatment of meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) in newborn infants.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment
      arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive lucinactant by bronchoalveolar lavage, into the right and left lung,
      followed by lung drainage. Treatment repeats when patient stabilizes or every 15 minutes for
      2 courses.

      Arm II: Patients receive standard treatment including oxygen, conventional mechanical
      ventilation, sedation, paralysis, vasopressors, and alkalinization.

      Patients are followed for 12 months.
