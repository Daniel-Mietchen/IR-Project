TITLE:
Longitudinal and Biological Study of Childhood Disintegrative Disorder

CONDITION:
Pervasive Child Development Disorders

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare the developmental course (language acquisition, diagnostic stability, predictors
      of outcome, and restricted interests and behaviors) of childhood disintegrative disorder
      versus autism and non-autistic developmental delays.

      II. Collect data on molecular genetics of proband and family members.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      Patients are evaluated with the following questionnaires at ages 2-3 years and again at ages
      5-9: The Autism Diagnostic Interview (ADI); The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule
      (ADOS); Assessment of cognitive functioning; Expressive and receptive language; Adaptive
      functioning; Measures of burden and functional assessment; The Aberrant Behavior Checklist;
      The Connors Rating Scale - Parent and Teacher version; and Autism Behavior Checklist

      An MRI and EEG are performed, and blood samples are collected from patients and family
      members for molecular genetic studies.
