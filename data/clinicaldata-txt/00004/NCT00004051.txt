TITLE:
Irinotecan in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors

CONDITION:
Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific

INTERVENTION:
irinotecan hydrochloride

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of irinotecan in treating patients who
      have advanced solid tumors.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose, dose limiting toxicity, and safety
      profile of oral irinotecan in patients with advanced solid tumors. II. Characterize the
      single and multiple dose pharmacokinetics of oral irinotecan and its metabolites, SN-38 and
      SN-38 glucuronide, in these patients. III. Document any antitumor activity in these patients
      treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive oral irinotecan once daily for 14
      days. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      or more of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed monthly for 6
      months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 3-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
