TITLE:
Phase III Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study of Dichlorphenamide for Periodic Paralyses and Associated Sodium Channel Disorders

CONDITION:
Paralysis, Hyperkalemic Periodic

INTERVENTION:
dichlorphenamide

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the efficacy of dichlorphenamide in the treatment of episodic weakness attacks in
      patients with hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, paramyotonia congenita with periodic
      paralysis, and hypokalemic periodic paralysis.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind study. Patients are stratified by
      participating institution and diagnosis.

      The weekly attack rate is determined during an 8-week assessment prior to therapy initiation
      and at crossover.

      Patients are randomly assigned to oral dichlorphenamide (DCP) or placebo for 9 weeks and
      then cross to the alternate treatment. Patients on DCP at baseline continue on the same
      dose; those on acetazolamide (ACZ) at baseline receive a DCP dose equivalent to one fifth of
      the ACZ dose.
