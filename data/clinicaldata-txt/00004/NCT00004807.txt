TITLE:
Study of the Pathogenesis of Rett Syndrome

CONDITION:
Rett Syndrome

INTERVENTION:
dextromethorphan

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Extend current knowledge of the phenotype and natural history of Rett
      syndrome (RS).

      II. Continue the search for a cytogenetic and/or DNA marker. III. Study the effects of
      cholinergic drugs based on preliminary evidence for reduced levels of brain acetylcholine,
      while continuing supportive care to modify seizures, respiratory abnormalities, and motor
      disturbances, and improve nutrition, behavior, and learning.

      IV. Identify targets for future therapeutic interventions, e.g., growth factors, to
      influence neurologic recovery.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients receive a comprehensive clinical evaluation including an
      ophthalmologic exam; speech, communication, and developmental assessment; nutritional
      evaluation; neurologic exam; respiratory monitoring; and cytogenetic studies.

      Selected patients with malnutrition are given night feedings of Pediasure with Fiber by
      nasogastric tube. Specific recommendations for feeding techniques and diet are made.

      Selected patients with seizures or severe hyperventilation and progressive rigidity are
      nonrandomly assigned to dextromethorphan or topiramate therapy.

      Oral dextromethorphan is maintained 6 months to 1 year; duration of therapy depends on
      response. Oral topiramate is given for 6 months to 1 year, and Aricept for 6 months to 1
      year.

      Concurrent anticonvulsants may require dose adjustments while on above protocols. Supportive
      care for constipation, scoliosis, and weight loss is allowed.
