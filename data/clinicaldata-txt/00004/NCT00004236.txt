TITLE:
Liposomal Doxorubicin in Treating Patients With Advanced Stomach Cancer

CONDITION:
Esophageal Cancer

INTERVENTION:
pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of liposomal doxorubicin in treating
      patients who have advanced stomach cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine overall survival, time to disease progression, objective reponse
      rate, safety profile, and quality of life in patients with inoperable gastric adenocarcinoma
      when treated with doxorubicin HCl liposome.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome IV over 1 hour every 4 weeks. Treatment
      continues for up to 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease
      progression. Patients with responding disease may continue therapy past the 6 courses until
      documented disease progression. Quality of life is assessed prior to every treatment course.
      All patients are followed at 1 month. Patients with stable or responding disease are then
      followed every 3 months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 24 months.
