TITLE:
Phase II Study of the Enzyme Inhibitor NTBC for Tyrosinemia Type I

CONDITION:
Tyrosinemia, Type I

INTERVENTION:
NTBC

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES:

      Assess whether 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione (NTBC) at 0.6 mg/kg
      per day prevents liver failure in at least 1 patient with tyrosinemia type I.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Only 2 patients with tyrosinemia type I are known to this research team;
      others will be treated if found and if clinical conditions permit.

      The enzyme inhibitor 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione (NTBC) is
      administered orally, in 2 divided doses daily with meals.

      Patients will be followed closely for side effects attributable to NTBC.
