TITLE:
Phase II Pilot Study of Aminoimidazole Carboxamide Riboside (AICAR), a Precursor of Purine Synthesis, for Lesch-Nyhan Disease

CONDITION:
Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome

INTERVENTION:
aminomidazole carboxamide riboside

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effects of aminoimidazole carboxamide riboside (AICAR) on
      hematologic manifestations of Lesch-Nyhan disease.

      II. Assess the behavioral and neurological benefits of AICAR in patients with Lesch-Nyhan
      disease.

      III. Examine the effect of AICAR on purine production.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      After a 3-day baseline, patients are treated with aminoimidazole carboxamide riboside
      (AICAR) by continuous infusion for 12 days. Concurrent allopurinol and folate are allowed.
