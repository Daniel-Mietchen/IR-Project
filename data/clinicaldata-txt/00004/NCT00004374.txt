TITLE:
Study of Systemic Amyloidosis Presentation and Prognosis

CONDITION:
Amyloidosis

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Analyze prospectively the course of amyloid deposition in patients with
      primary, secondary, myeloma-associated, and hereditary amyloidosis.

      II. Determine abnormalities of humoral and delayed-type hypersensitivity in these patients.

      III. Identify prognostic factors in hereditary amyloidosis and develop tests for genetic
      defects associated with systemic amyloidosis.

      IV. Diagnose familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) prior to symptom onset. V. Validate
      the correlation of low serum prealbumin and retinol binding protein levels with amyloidosis
      in patients with FAP.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients receive a comprehensive evaluation with an emphasis on
      identifying prognostic and diagnostic factors. Assessments include gastrointestinal, renal,
      hematologic, dermatologic, cardiac, and serologic studies. Immunologic studies include
      antinuclear antibody, latex fixation, and serum and urine electrophoresis.

      Genetic trees are constructed using detailed family history data; blood and urine samples
      are routinely collected from relatives. Family members of patients with familial amyloidotic
      polyneuropathy type II (Indiana type) undergo a flexor retinaculum biopsy of the wrist.
