TITLE:
Stem Cell Transplantation (SCT) for Genetic Diseases

CONDITION:
Thrombocytopenia

INTERVENTION:
Stem Cell Transplantation

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Ascertain whether stem cell transplantation (SCT) is an effective method by
      which missing or dysfunctional enzymes can be replaced in patients with various inborn
      errors of metabolism.

      II. Determine whether clinical manifestations of the specific disease may be arrested or
      reversed by this treatment.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients receive either cyclophosphamide and high dose total body
      irradiation (TBI) or busulfan and cyclophosphamide.

      Cyclophosphamide IV is given on days -5 and -4 and TBI on days -2, -1, and 0. Busulfan is
      given orally every 6 hours on days -9 through -6 and cyclophosphamide IV on days -5 through
      -2. Patients rest on day -1.

      Patients receive bone marrow infusion on day 0. For GVHD prophylaxis, patients receive
      methotrexate on day 1, then on days 3, 6, and 11. Cyclosporine IV begins on day -2 over 12
      hours, followed by continuous infusion for 21 days. Then, oral doses of cyclosporine are
      given every 12 hours to patients who tolerate oral feeding. Cyclosporine is continued 6
      months posttransplant, then tapered 10% per week and stopped.

      Patients who receive genotypically HLA nonidentical stem cells undergo additional GVHD
      prophylaxis with methylprednisolone (IV or PO) or its equivalent every 12 hours on days 3 to
      day 100. Dose is then tapered as tolerated over 1 month.

      Patients who receive cord blood stem cells receive methylprednisolone instead of
      methotrexate for GHVD prophylaxis. Methylprednisolone is given 3 times daily beginning on
      day 5 and continuing until day 17. Then, methylprednisolone is tapered 10% per week as
      clinically tolerated.

      To accelerate engraftment, patients receive filgrastim IM daily beginning on day +1 and
      continuing until ANC equals 5000.
