TITLE:
Phase III Randomized Study of Cyclophosphamide With or Without Antithymocyte Globulin Before Bone Marrow Transplantation in Patients With Aplastic Anemia

CONDITION:
Aplastic Anemia

INTERVENTION:
Anti-thymocyte globulin

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare outcome, including graft failure, graft versus host disease, and survival of
      HLA-identical sibling bone marrow transplants for aplastic anemia using cyclophosphamide
      with or without antithymocyte globulin as a conditioning regimen.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to
      receive cyclophosphamide IV over 60 minutes on days -5 to -2 with or without antithymocyte
      globulin IV over 4 hours.

      All patients then receive bone marrow over 60-120 minutes on day 0, 36 hours after the last
      dose of cyclophosphamide.

      Patients are followed at day 100, at 6 months, and at 1 year posttransplant.
