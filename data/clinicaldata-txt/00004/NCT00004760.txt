TITLE:
Study of Axial Mobility Exercises in Parkinson Disease

CONDITION:
Parkinson Disease

INTERVENTION:
Exercise

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare the benefit of exercise versus usual care (no exercise) on impairments and
      functional limitations in patients with Parkinson disease.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients assigned to the Axial Mobility
      Exercise Program participate 3 times a week for 10 weeks. The program consists of
      individualized exercises specifically directed toward restoration of axial mobility in the
      context of functional tasks.

      Patients assigned to the control group receive standard care (no exercise).
