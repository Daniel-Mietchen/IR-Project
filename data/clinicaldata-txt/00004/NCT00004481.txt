TITLE:
Genetic Study of Sitosterolemia

CONDITION:
Lipid Metabolism, Inborn Errors

INTERVENTION:
genetic testing

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Identify the genetic defect and fine map the gene that causes sitosterolemia.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients, family members, and normal volunteers provide blood samples for
      genetic studies and may fill out a general health and medication history.

      Linkage analysis and microsatellite screening is performed on genomic DNA, especially
      chromosome 2p21, between microsatellite markers D2S1788 and D2S1352.

      Positive results may be reported to the patient and may influence future treatment.
