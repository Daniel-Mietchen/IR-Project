TITLE:
Study of the Nutritional, Metabolic, and Body Composition Profile in Children and Adolescents With Epidermolysis Bullosa

CONDITION:
Epidermolysis Bullosa

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Characterize the nutritional and metabolic profile of children and
      adolescents with epidermolysis bullosa.

      II. Determine patterns of body composition in these patients. III. Determine the energy
      requirements of these patients by measuring resting energy expenditure.

      IV. Assess protein nutrition by measuring lean body mass.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      Data collected from a 5-day food diary are analyzed for protein, nutrient, and calorie
      intake. Nutritional, metabolic, and body composition are evaluated by indirect calorimetry,
      total body electrical conductivity, total body potassium, and lean body mass.
