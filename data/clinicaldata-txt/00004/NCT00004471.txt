TITLE:
Phase I Pilot Study of Gene Therapy for Cystic Fibrosis Using Cationic Liposome Mediated Gene Transfer

CONDITION:
Cystic Fibrosis

INTERVENTION:
pGT-1 gene lipid complex

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES:

      Determine whether copies of the cystic fibrosis gene (pGT-1) can be delivered to the cells
      lining the nose of cystic fibrosis patients using cationic liposome (DMRIE/DOPE) mediated
      gene transfer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Under direct visualization, patients receive lipid/DNA formulation (pGT-1
      lipid complex) by syringe instillation over 30 minutes to the right inferior nasal
      turbinate.

      Patients are followed daily for 7 days, twice a week for 3 weeks, every 2-3 weeks for 10
      weeks, then every 3 months thereafter.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 16 Years to N/A
Criteria:

        -  Cystic fibrosis patients

          -  Not pregnant Fertile patients must use effective contraception
