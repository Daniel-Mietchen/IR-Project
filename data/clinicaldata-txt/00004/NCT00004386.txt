TITLE:
Phase I Pilot Study of Liver-Directed Gene Therapy for Partial Ornithine Transcarbamylase Deficiency

CONDITION:
Ornithine Transcarbamylase Deficiency Disease

INTERVENTION:
recombinant adenovirus containing the ornithine transcarbamylase gene

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES:

      Evaluate the safety and feasibility of administering recombinant adenovirus containing the
      ornithine transcarbamylase gene to adults with partial ornithine transcarbamylase
      deficiency.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This a dose escalation study to estimate the maximum tolerated dose of
      recombinant adenovirus encoded with the ornithine transcarbamylase gene.

      Patients receive a single dose of virus infused into the liver under fluoroscopic guidance.
      Groups of 3 patients receive successively higher doses of virus; each cohort is observed for
      safety for 3 weeks before entry of the next group.

      Patients are followed weekly for 1 month, then every 3 months until stable.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 18 Years to 65 Years
Criteria:

        PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA:
