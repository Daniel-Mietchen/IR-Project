TITLE:
Gemcitabine Plus Docetaxel or Irinotecan in Treating Patients With Stage IIIB or Stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer

CONDITION:
Lung Cancer

INTERVENTION:
docetaxel

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of gemcitabine plus either docetaxel or
      irinotecan in treating patients who have stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the complete and overall response rate to gemcitabine and docetaxel
      versus gemcitabine and irinotecan in chemotherapy naive patients with stage IIIB or IV
      non-small cell lung cancer. II. Compare the overall and failure free survival, duration of
      response, and toxicity associated with these combination regimens in this patient
      population.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to disease stage
      (stage IIIB vs stage IV without CNS involvement vs stage IV with CNS involvement vs
      recurrent/progressive disease post surgery and/or radiotherapy). Patients are randomized to
      one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes
      immediately followed by irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 8. Arm II: Patients
      receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes immediately followed by docetaxel IV over 60 minutes
      on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving partial or complete response or stable disease
      receive treatment for least 6 courses and for 2 additional courses beyond the maximum
      response, and then at the investigator's discretion. Patients are followed every 3 months
      for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter until disease
      progression or death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 72 patients (36 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 12 months.
