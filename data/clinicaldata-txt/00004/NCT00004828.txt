TITLE:
Liothyronine in Children With Single Ventricle Congenital Cardiac Malformations Undergoing the Fontan Procedure

CONDITION:
Tricuspid Atresia

INTERVENTION:
liothyronine I 131

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the pharmacokinetics of exogenous liothyronine administered in
      children undergoing the modified Fontan procedure.

      II. Determine the liothyronine supplementation dose that counters the fall in serum
      liothyronine concentrations and provides the greatest potential myocardial benefit after the
      modified Fontan procedure.

      III. Evaluate the potential toxicity of exogenous liothyronine administered in children
      undergoing a modified Fontan procedure.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo controlled, dose escalation study.

      Initially, patients are randomized to receive either 1 of 3 different dosages of
      liothyronine or placebo after undergoing the Fontan procedure. If no unacceptable toxicity
      is observed in this group, a third dose level of liothyronine is added to the randomization.
      A total of 7 patients are enrolled at each dose level. All randomized study drugs are
      administered by continuous infusion over 1 hour after surgery.

      Cardiac function is assessed 5 days after surgery.
