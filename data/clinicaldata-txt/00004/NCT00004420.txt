TITLE:
Study of Gammalinolenic Acid for Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis

CONDITION:
Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis

INTERVENTION:
gamma-Linolenic acid

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the efficacy and safety of gammalinolenic acid in the treatment of childhood
      arthritis.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, cross over study
      of 12 months duration. Patients are stratified by type of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis
      (systemic onset vs pauciarticular disease vs polyarticular disease).

      Patients are randomized to receive either gammalinolenic acid (GLA) or placebo (safflower
      seed oil) orally. Parents are asked to maintain the child's usual diet over the course of
      study.

      Patients are followed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months during study and at 6 months thereafter.
