TITLE:
Phase II Study of Leuprolide and Testosterone for Men With Kennedy's Disease or Other Motor Neuron Disease

CONDITION:
Spinal Muscular Atrophy

INTERVENTION:
leuprolide

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the effects of androgen suppression with leuprolide and androgen replacement
      with testosterone enanthate on muscle strength in men with Kennedy's disease or other motor
      neuron disease.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      All patients receive androgen suppression with leuprolide acetate injections every 4 weeks
      for 6 months, plus hormone replacement therapy with testosterone enanthate injections every
      week for 24 weeks.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: Male
Age: 18 Years to N/A
Criteria:

        PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA:
