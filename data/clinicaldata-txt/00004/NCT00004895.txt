TITLE:
Octreotide as Palliative Therapy for Cancer-Related Bowel Obstruction That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery

CONDITION:
Colorectal Cancer

INTERVENTION:
octreotide acetate

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Palliative therapy with octreotide may help patients who have bowel obstruction
      that cannot be removed by surgery to live longer and more comfortably.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of octreotide as palliative therapy in
      treating patients who have cancer-related bowel obstruction that cannot be removed by
      surgery.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the effectiveness of octreotide in the palliation of bowel obstruction
           secondary to cancer.

        -  Characterize the dose and tolerability of octreotide in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive octreotide subcutaneously or IV over 24 hours on days 2-5.

      Patients who respond well to study may continue octreotide for palliative effects.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-25 patients will be accrued for this study over 9 months.
