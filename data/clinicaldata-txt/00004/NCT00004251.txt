TITLE:
Letrozole in Treating Women With Recurrent or Metastatic Endometrial Cancer

CONDITION:
Endometrial Cancer

INTERVENTION:
letrozole

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of letrozole in treating women who have
      recurrent or metastatic endometrial cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of letrozole, in terms of objective tumor response and
      time to progression, in women with recurrent or metastatic endometrial cancer. II. Determine
      the toxicity of letrozole in these patients. III. Determine the relationship between tumor
      receptor status, histologic grade, tumor aromatase activity, and tumor response in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive an oral letrozole tablet daily. Treatment continues for patients
      with complete or partial response until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients with stable disease may discontinue therapy after 24 weeks. Patients are followed
      at 1 month and then every 3 months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18 months.
