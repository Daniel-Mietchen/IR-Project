TITLE:
Study of Homocysteine Metabolism in Homocystinuria

CONDITION:
Homocystinuria

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine basal and postmethionine plasma homocysteine in patients with
      premature vascular disease, cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) or methylenetitrahydrofolate
      reductase (MTHFR) deficiency, and in obligate heterozygotes for CBS or MTHFR.

      II. Determine whole-body homocysteine metabolic rates with isotopically-labeled methionine.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a two-part study of homocysteine metabolism. Age-matched normal
      controls are entered in both parts of the study.

      In first part of the study, participants are given oral methionine; baseline and
      postmethionine studies include amino acid quantitation, analysis of rapidly deproteinized
      plasma, and total plasma homocysteine.

      In the second part of the study, participants (men and postmenopausal women only) undergo
      methionine tracer studies.
