TITLE:
Randomized Study of Propofol Versus Fentanyl and Midazolam in Pediatric Patients Requiring Mechanical Ventilation and Sedation Therapy

CONDITION:
Respiration Disorders

INTERVENTION:
fentanyl

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the degree of amnesia afforded by study sedatives relative to the patient's
      intensive care unit experiences.

      II. Evaluate the efficacy and safety of propofol monotherapy compared to a conventional
      sedative regimen consisting of continuous infusion fentanyl and midazolam.

      III. Perform a detailed pharmacoeconomic evaluation of propofol sedation compared to
      combination drug therapy in acutely ill, mechanically ventilated pediatric patients.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      This is a randomized, double blind study.

      Patients are randomized to receive either a continuous infusion of propofol or a continuous
      infusion combination of fentanyl and midazolam preceded by a loading dose. Sedative doses
      may be reduced if necessary. Treatment is continued until sedation is no longer needed, any
      other sedative therapy is administered, or unacceptable toxicity is experienced.

      Patients are assessed after extubation, just prior to hospital discharge, and then every 2
      months for 6 months after hospital discharge.

Criteria:

        -  Patients admitted to the Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital Pediatric Intensive
             Care Unit who require mechanical ventilation and sedation therapy

          -  Mean COMFORT score must be greater than 26 after 3 consecutive scores are obtained at
             2 minute intervals over 6 minutes

          -  No other concurrent sedative therapy
