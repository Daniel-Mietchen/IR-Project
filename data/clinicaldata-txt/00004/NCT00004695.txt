TITLE:
Randomized Study of Polyethylene-Glycol-Conjugated Interleukin 2 in Patients With Common Variable Immunodeficiency

CONDITION:
Common Variable Immunodeficiency

INTERVENTION:
PEG-interleukin-2

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether polyethylene-glycol-conjugated interleukin 2 (PEG-IL-2) can
      reduce the number of infections in patients with common variable immunodeficiency.

      II. Determine whether this therapy can improve lung functions in these patients with
      pulmonary impairment.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label study. Patients are randomized to receive
      polyethylene-glycol-conjugated interleukin 2 (PEG-IL-2) or placebo.

      Patients receive PEG-IL-2 or placebo by subcutaneous injection weekly for 18 months.
      Patients maintain a daily diary for 24 months.

      Patients are followed every 4 months for 2 years.
