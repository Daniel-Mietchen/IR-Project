TITLE:
Pilot Study of the Effect of Baclofen and Bromocriptine on Luteinizing Hormone Secretion in Pubertal Children

CONDITION:
Growth Disorders

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the effect of bromocriptine on luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion by
      suppression of prolactin and stimulation of dopaminergic receptors in early pubertal boys
      and girls.

      II. Evaluate the effect of baclofen on LH secretion by stimulation of gamma-aminobutyric
      acid receptors in early pubertal boys and girls.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      Participants receive bromocriptine or baclofen followed by nocturnal measurements of
      luteinizing hormone, growth hormone, and sex steroids. Pituitary reserve is evaluated with
      the administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, and in children undergoing assessment
      of short stature, standard provocative stimuli.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: N/A to 18 Years
Criteria:

        -  Short stature and/or constitutional growth delay

          -  No epilepsy or risk of epilepsy
