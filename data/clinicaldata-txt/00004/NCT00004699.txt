TITLE:
Dose Ranging Study of Recombinant Human Insulin-like Growth Factor I in Children With Hyperinsulinism

CONDITION:
Hyperinsulinism

INTERVENTION:
insulin-like growth factor I

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the dose of recombinant human insulin-like growth factor I that minimizes or
      decreases the need for exogenous glucose support without causing hypoglycemia.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive an escalating dose of
      recombinant human insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). IGF-I is given subcutaneously twice
      a day. The dose of IGF-I is increased each day for 4 days. Glucose is administered
      intravenously, when necessary, to prevent hypoglycemia.

      Following the study treatment patients resume prior medication and may undergo surgery.

        PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA:

        --Disease Characteristics--

          -  Diagnosis of hyperinsulinism (i.e., evidence of fasting hypoglycemia with inadequate
             suppression of insulin, normal pituitary and adrenal function, and increased insulin
             action)

          -  Intractable hypoglycemia (i.e., persistent IV glucose requirement for maintaining
             glucose levels greater than 60 mg/dL)

          -  Failed standard treatment regimen of diazoxide, octreotide, and frequent feedings to
             control hypoglycemia

          -  No other major medical problems
