TITLE:
Study of Individualized Instruction Versus Pamphlet in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus

CONDITION:
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus

INTERVENTION:
Tailored educational program

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate an educational program that has been pretested for cultural appropriateness and
      literacy requirements in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

      II. Assess the impact of this educational program on patients with SLE, with an emphasis on
      recognizing cardinal symptoms, coping with fatigue, regulating medications, and
      communicating with the physician.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      Patients are randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

      One group participates in an educational program administered and coordinated by a health
      educator. The program includes 1 or 2 educational sessions emphasizing practical advice,
      each lasting approximately 1.5 hours; social support from a patient-identified management
      partner; and behavioral reinforcement from health center staff, the patient partner, and
      written and audio materials.

      The control group receives patient educational materials consistent with usual care
      (pamphlets).

      Patients are followed at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months.
