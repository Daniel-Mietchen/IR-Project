TITLE:
Phase III Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study of 3,4-Diaminopyridine for Demyelinating Polyneuropathy

CONDITION:
Polyradiculoneuropathy, Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating

INTERVENTION:
,4-diaminopyridine

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the efficacy of 3,4-diaminopyridine in patients with stable chronic demyelinating
      polyneuropathy.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind study. Patients are randomly assigned
