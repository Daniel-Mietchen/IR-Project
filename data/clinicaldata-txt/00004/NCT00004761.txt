TITLE:
Establishment of the National Epidermolysis Bullosa Registry

CONDITION:
Epidermolysis Bullosa

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Develop a large roster of well-characterized patients with various forms of
      inherited and acquired epidermolysis bullosa (EB).

      II. Generate a large data bank of clinical, historical, and genetic information concerning
      these patients.

      III. Accumulate donated tissue specimens, including selected cells and DNA, from selected
      patient subsets for the establishment of permanent tissue cell banks.

      IV. Promote and facilitate research in EB.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients are enrolled by mail or clinic visit at 1 of 4 clinical centers.
      Clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory data are collected.

      Medical and family histories are obtained in a detailed interview in person, by phone, or by
      mail. Diagnostic studies to confirm the type of epidermolysis bullosa are performed as
      indicated. A pedigree chart is completed on the first affected family member entered.

      Selected patients are followed at least biannually. A study duration of approximately 10
      years is anticipated.
