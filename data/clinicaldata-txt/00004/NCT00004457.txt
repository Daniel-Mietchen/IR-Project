TITLE:
Determinants of Disease Severity in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis

CONDITION:
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine specific clinical features, molecular abnormalities, and laboratory-based
      biological markers of free radical stress that are associated with amyotrophic lateral
      sclerosis and influence disease severity.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a screening and diagnostic study. Blood and urine samples are
      collected from patients every 2 months for 1 year. All samples are evaluated for measures of
      free radical damage and levels of the body's own antioxidant activity.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 18 Years to N/A
Criteria:

        PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA:

        --Disease Characteristics-- Clinically diagnosed probable or definite, sporadic or
        familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis

        --Patient Characteristics-- Pulmonary: No artificial ventilation required Other: No other
        neurodegenerative diseases No concurrent or history of unstable medical illness
