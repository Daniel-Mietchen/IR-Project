TITLE:
Pilot Randomized Study of Paromomycin (Aminosidine) vs Streptomycin for Uncomplicated Pulmonary Tuberculosis

CONDITION:
Tuberculosis, Pulmonary

INTERVENTION:
paromomycin

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the pharmacokinetics and early bactericidal activity of paromomycin
      (aminosidine) vs streptomycin for the treatment of uncomplicated pulmonary tuberculosis.

      II. Compare the tolerability of these two drugs in these patients. III. Establish the
      relationships between achieved serum concentration, minimal inhibitory concentration, and
      early bactericidal activity of paromomycin and streptomycin.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to one of three
      treatment arms. Patients in arms I and II receive one of two doses of paromomycin
      intramuscularly once a day for 3 days. Patients in arm III receive streptomycin
      intramuscularly once a day for 3 days. All patients then begin a course of standard therapy
      for tuberculosis.
