TITLE:
Phase II Study of Lactulose and Circadian Rhythms in Patients With Cirrhosis

CONDITION:
Portal Hypertension

INTERVENTION:
lactulose

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the effect of lactulose on the circadian rhythm of plasma melatonin in
      patients with subclinical hepatic encephalopathy.

      II. Assess the intrasubject variability of circadian melatonin levels and neuropsychological
      tests.

      III. Assess which elements of the neuropsychological test battery show the response to
      lactulose.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients are alternately assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups: no therapy
      for 3 weeks followed by lactulose for 3 weeks versus lactulose for 3 weeks followed by no
      therapy for 3 weeks.

      A dietician advises patients on a 1 g/kg per day protein diet. The lactulose dose is
      adjusted to result in 2 or 3 loose bowel movements per day.
