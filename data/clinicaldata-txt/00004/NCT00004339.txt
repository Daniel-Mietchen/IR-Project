TITLE:
Study of Tetrathiomolybdate in Patients With Wilson Disease

CONDITION:
Wilson Disease

INTERVENTION:
tetrathiomolybdate

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES:

      Evaluate the safety and efficacy of ammonium tetrathiomolybdate alone and compared with
      trientine therapy as initial treatment in patients with Wilson disease presenting
      neurologically.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This a double blind, randomized study. Patients are randomized into one of
      two treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive tetrathiomolybdate (TM) 3 times a day with meals and 3 times a day
      between meals for 8 weeks in the absence of neurologic deterioration or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Arm II: Patients receive trientine therapy for 8 weeks in the absence of neurologic
      deterioration and unacceptable toxicity.

      Additional therapy (off study): Patients in the TM group may receive maintenance zinc, while
      those in the trientine group may continue on trientine or switch to zinc.
