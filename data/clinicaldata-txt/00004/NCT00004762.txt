Phase II Pilot Study of Cladribine (2-Chlorodeoxyadenosine; 2-CdA) for Early Stage Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis

CONDITION:
Cholangitis, Sclerosing

INTERVENTION:
cladribine

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the effects of cladribine (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine; 2-CdA) on biochemical,
      radiologic, and histologic parameters in patients with early stage primary sclerosing
      cholangitis.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      Patients are treated with subcutaneous injections of cladribine (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine;
