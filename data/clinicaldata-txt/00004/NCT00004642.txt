TITLE:
Phase I/II Study of Human Anti-Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Monoclonal Antibody MSL-109 in Newborns With Symptomatic Congenital CMV Infection Without Central Nervous System Disease

CONDITION:
Cytomegalovirus Infections

INTERVENTION:
SDZ MSL-109

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the safety, tolerance, and potential efficacy of 3 doses of human
      anti-cytomegalovirus (CMV) monoclonal antibody SDZ MSL-109 (MOAB MSL-109) in the treatment
      of newborns with congenital CMV infection and no central nervous system disease.

      II. Determine the relationship between plasma concentrations of MOAB MSL-109 and therapeutic
      outcome.

      III. Determine whether MOAB MSL-109 influences the antibody response and clearance of virus
      from the urine.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients are treated with human anti-cytomegalovirus monoclonal antibody
      MSL-109, administered intravenously every other week for a total of 3 doses.

      Groups of 6 patients are treated at each of 3 MSL-109 doses; there is no intrapatient
      escalation.

      No concurrent therapy with antibiotics for systemic infection, parenteral antifungal agents,
      biological response modifiers, or other antiviral agents is allowed.

      Patients are followed every 2 weeks for 6 weeks, every 4 weeks for 12 weeks, then annually
      for 5 years.
