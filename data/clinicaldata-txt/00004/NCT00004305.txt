TITLE:
Study of Genetic Anomalies of Complement Related Proteins in Patients With IgA Glomerulonephritis

CONDITION:
IGA Glomerulonephritis

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether allelic differences associated with the fourth component of
      complement, type-1 complement receptor expressed on erythrocytes, and Fc receptor FcgRIII
      contribute to the pathogenesis of IgA glomerulonephritis (IgA-N).

      II. Compare genetic anomalies of these key components in immune complex processing and
      clearance between juvenile vs adult onset IgA-N vs normal controls.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      Participants undergo qualitative genetic analysis of complement-related proteins. Studies
      include: genomic re-arrangement of 4-gene unit, C4 DNA sequence and RNA expression, type-1
      complement receptor DNA sequence, Fc-gamma receptor IIIA isoform analysis, classical and
      alternative complement activation pathway assays, plasma C4 and C4d protein levels, and
      immunoglobulin patterns in glomerular deposits.
