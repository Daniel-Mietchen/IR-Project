TITLE:
Study of the Natural History and Genotype-Phenotype Correlations of Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia Patients

CONDITION:
Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Collect data regarding the natural history of hereditary hemorrhagic
      telangiectasia (HHT).

      II. Establish genotype-phenotype correlations in HHT. III. Create a database of information
      for researchers throughout the world.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients complete a self-administered natural history questionnaire in a
      multiple choice format. Questionnaire is completed by a population consisting of males and
      females of all ages and ethnic backgrounds.

      Data are collected and made available to all researchers.
    

ELIGIBILITY:

Criteria:

        -  Diagnosed hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler-Rendu-Weber disease) with
             recurrent epistaxis, telangiectases, and visceral vascular anomalies
