TITLE:
Phase I Randomized Study of CPX for the Treatment of Adult Patients With Mild Cystic Fibrosis

CONDITION:
Cystic Fibrosis

INTERVENTION:
CPX

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the safety of ascending doses of CPX administered to adult patients
      with mild cystic fibrosis.

      II. Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of ascending doses of CPX in this patient population.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, dose escalation
      study.

      There are 7 experimental cohorts, each treated with a different oral dose of CPX or placebo.
      Within each cohort, 4 patients receive a single dose of CPX and 1 patient receives placebo.
      Each patient is monitored 24 hours postdose. Escalation to the next dose level for each
      subsequent cohort begins only after the safety data obtained from the previous cohort is
      reviewed and found not to limit dose escalation.

      All patients return for a follow up evaluation 1 week after dosing.
