TITLE:
Study of Antenatal Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone in Women in Premature Labor to Prevent Lung Disease in Preterm Infants

CONDITION:
Respiratory Distress Syndrome

INTERVENTION:
thyrotropin-releasing hormone

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the efficacy and safety of antenatal administration of thyrotropin-releasing
      hormone to women in premature labor to improve pulmonary outcomes in preterm infants.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, multicenter study. Patients are
      randomized to receive antenatal thyrotropin-releasing hormone or placebo.

      Patients receive thyrotropin-releasing hormone or placebo intravenously over 20 minutes
      every 8 hours for 4 doses.

      Infants are assessed for survival and chronic lung disease until day 28 after birth, and
      again at 36 postmenstrual weeks.
