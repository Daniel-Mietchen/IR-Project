TITLE:
Phase III Randomized, Double-Blind Study of Prednisone for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy

CONDITION:
Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy

INTERVENTION:
prednisone

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Characterize the effect of prednisone on muscle protein metabolism in
      patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

      II. Determine whether prednisone changes levels of insulin-like growth factor 1, growth
      hormone, and insulin.

      III. Characterize the effect of prednisone on muscle morphometry and muscle localization of
      utrophin.

      IV. Compare the prednisone response in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy to that
      seen in normal individuals and in patients with facioscapulohumeral dystrophy.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind study. Patients are randomly assigned
      to prednisone or placebo. Therapy is administered daily for 12 weeks; prednisone is then
      tapered.
