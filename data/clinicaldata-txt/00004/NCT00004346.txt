TITLE:
Phase II Study of Cholesterol- and Cholestanol-Free Diet, Lovastatin, and Chenodeoxycholic Acid for Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis

CONDITION:
Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis

INTERVENTION:
chenodeoxycholic acid

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the biosynthesis of cholesterol and cholestanol, and measure the
      turnover of individual sterols and bile acids in patients with cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis before and after a cholesterol- and cholestanol-free diet.

      II. Assess the biosynthesis of cholesterol and cholestanol, and measure the turnover of
      individual sterols and bile acids in these patients before and after lovastatin and
      chenodeoxycholic acid.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Following a 2-week baseline assessment, patients participate in a feeding
      study for up to 3 weeks. The diet is free of cholesterol and cholestanol.

      For the next 4 weeks, patients return to their typical diet and are medicated with daily
      lovastatin and chenodeoxycholic acid.

      The feeding study is repeated for an additional 3 weeks, with the patient taking either
      lovastatin or chenodeoxycholic acid.
