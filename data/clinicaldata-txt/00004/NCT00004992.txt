TITLE:
Diabetes Prevention Program

CONDITION:
Diabetes Mellitus, Non-Insulin-Dependent

INTERVENTION:
Intensive lifestyle

SUMMARY:

      The Diabetes Prevention Program is a nationwide clinical study to answer the question: Can
      Type 2 diabetes (also called noninsulin-dependent or adult-onset diabetes) be prevented or
      delayed? The study has recruited 3819 volunteers, who are at high risk of developing
      diabetes, at twenty-five medical centers in the United States. It is sponsored by the
      National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National Institutes
      of Health, and other Institute and corporate sponsors. Researchers will evaluate the
      efficacy of a lifestyle intervention and a pharmacological intervention in preventing or
      delaying Type 2 diabetes in persons with IGT, impaired glucose tolerance. Each person in the
      study will be followed for 3 to 6 years.
