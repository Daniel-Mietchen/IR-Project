TITLE:
Community-Based Environmental Health Intervention

CONDITION:
Poisoning

INTERVENTION:
Behavior modification through social marketing

SUMMARY:

      This community-based project, called the Together for Agricultural Safety project, was
      developed to help farmworkers reduce their exposure to dangerous agricultural chemicals
      (such as pesticides) through education and social marketing. The project is a partnership of
      university researchers and the Farmworkers Association of Florida. After collecting
      extensive data from farmworkers, health providers and farm owners about primary means of
      pesticide exposure we are collaboratively developing an intervention that will reduce
      pesticide exposure by educating workers and owners about: the need to have adequate washing
      facilities; to wash hands frequently; to obey reentry intervals; to change work clothes
      after work to prevent child exposure and more.
