TITLE:
Amlodipine Plus Botulinum Toxin for Focal Dystonia

CONDITION:
Focal Dystonia

INTERVENTION:
Amlodipine plus Botulinum toxin

SUMMARY:

      Objective: To determine if the calcium channel blockers, amlodipine can augment the effect
      of botulinum toxin injections in the treatment of focal dystonia.

      Study Population: 20 patients with cervical dystonia

      Design: Double-bind, placebo-controlled clinical trail.

      Outcome measures: For patients: dystonia rating scales (Twistrs, Fahn-Marsden dystonia
      scale, NINDS subjective patient rating scale), and hand grip strength. For healthy
      volunteers: Amplitude of EDB MEP.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Objective: To determine if the calcium channel blocker, amlodipine can augment the effect of
      botulinum toxin injections in the treatment of focal dystonia.

      Study Population: 20 patients with cervical dystonia

      Design: Double-bind, placebo-controlled clinical trail.

      Outcome measures: dystonia rating scales (TWISTRS)
