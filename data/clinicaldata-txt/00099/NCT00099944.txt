TITLE:
Efficacy and Safety of Vildagliptin in Combination With Glimepiride in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes

CONDITION:
Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2

INTERVENTION:
vildagliptin

SUMMARY:

      Many people with type 2 diabetes cannot maintain target blood glucose levels when taking a
      single oral drug. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of two
      doses of vildagliptin, an unapproved drug, in lowering overall blood glucose levels when
      added to glimepiride in people with type 2 diabetes not at target blood glucose levels on a
      sulfonylurea alone.
