TITLE:
Efficacy and Safety of Vildagliptin in Combination With Metformin in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes

CONDITION:
Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2

INTERVENTION:
vildagliptin

SUMMARY:

      Many people with type 2 diabetes cannot maintain target blood glucose levels when taking a
      single oral drug. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of two
      doses of vildagliptin, an unapproved drug, when added to metformin in people with type 2
      diabetes who are not at target blood glucose levels on metformin alone.
