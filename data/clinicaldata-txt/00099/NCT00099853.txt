TITLE:
Efficacy and Safety of Vildagliptin in Combination With Pioglitazone in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes

CONDITION:
Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2

INTERVENTION:
Vildagliptin

SUMMARY:

      Many people with type 2 diabetes cannot maintain target blood glucose levels when taking a
      single oral drug. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of
      vildagliptin, an unapproved drug, in lowering overall blood glucose levels when added to
      pioglitazone in people with type 2 diabetes not at target blood glucose levels on either
      pioglitazone or rosiglitazone alone.
