TITLE:
Study of the Safety of Substituting Exenatide for Insulin in Patients Using Insulin and Oral Antidiabetic Agents

CONDITION:
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

INTERVENTION:
exenatide

SUMMARY:

      This study will look at the safety of substituting exenatide for insulin in patients with
      type 2 diabetes who are currently taking insulin and oral antidiabetic agent(s).
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      This is an exploratory, multicenter, open-label, 2-arm, parallel trial. Approximately 30
      patients with type 2 diabetes, currently on a sulfonylurea, or meglitinide and/or metformin
      and insulin therapy, will be randomized to discontinue insulin and substitute it with
      exenatide or remain on their current diabetes therapy regimen. All patients will continue
      their current diet and exercise regimen during the study.
