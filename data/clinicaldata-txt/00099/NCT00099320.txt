Safety and Efficacy of Exenatide in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Using Thiazolidinediones or Thiazolidinediones and Metformin

CONDITION:
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

INTERVENTION:
exenatide

SUMMARY:

      This study is designed to compare the effects of twice-daily exenatide plus oral
      antidiabetic (OAD) agents and twice-daily placebo plus OAD with respect to glycemic control,
      as measured by hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), in patients with type 2 diabetes who experience
      inadequate glycemic control with OAD alone.
