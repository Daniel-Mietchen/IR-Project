TITLE:
Study of Magnesium Sulfate in Children With Reduced Bone Density Secondary to Chronic Cholestatic Liver Disease

CONDITION:
Alagille Syndrome

INTERVENTION:
magnesium gluconate

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the role of magnesium deficiency in the pathogenesis of decreased serum vitamin
      D and reduced bone density in children with chronic cholestatic liver disease.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      Patients receive magnesium sulfate IV over 1 hour on day 3. Patients then receive oral
      magnesium gluconate supplementation daily. Treatment with magnesium sulfate repeats once at
      3-6 months.
