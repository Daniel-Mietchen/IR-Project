TITLE:
Radiolabeled Monoclonal Antibody Therapy Followed by Bone Marrow or Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation in Treating Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer

CONDITION:
Breast Cancer

INTERVENTION:
filgrastim

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or
      deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Peripheral stem cell
      transplantation or bone marrow transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were
      destroyed by monoclonal antibody therapy used to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of radiolabeled monoclonal antibody
      therapy followed by bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients
      who have metastatic breast cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of yttrium Y 90 labeled, humanized monoclonal
           antibody BrE-3 when given in combination with indium In 111 labeled, humanized
           monoclonal antibody BrE-3 followed by autologous bone marrow or peripheral blood stem
           cell transplantation in patients with metastatic breast cancer.

        -  Determine hematopoietic engraftment in these patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the ability of indium In 111 labeled, humanized monoclonal antibody BrE-3 to
           image metastatic disease in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the preliminary antitumor response in these patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of yttrium Y 90 labeled, humanized monoclonal
      antibody BrE-3 (Y90 huMOAB BrE-3).

      Patients receive Y90 huMOAB BrE-3 and indium In 111 labeled, humanized monoclonal antibody
      BrE-3 IV over 1-2 hours on day -14. Patients undergo autologous bone marrow or peripheral
      blood stem cell transplantation on day 0. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) IV
      beginning on day 0 and continuing until blood counts recover.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of Y90 huMOAB BrE-3 until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicities.

      Patients are followed every 3-4 months for 1 year and then at least annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 3-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
