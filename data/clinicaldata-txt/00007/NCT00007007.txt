TITLE:
Evaluation of Memory Skills in Patients Receiving Radiation Therapy for Brain Metastases

CONDITION:
Cognitive/Functional Effects

INTERVENTION:
management of therapy complications

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Assessment of patients undergoing radiation therapy may help to determine the
      effects of the treatment and may help improve cancer treatment.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the memory skills in patients receiving radiation
      therapy for brain metastases.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the feasibility of performing a test battery consisting of five
      neurocognitive measures and a quality of life instrument following radiotherapy in patients
      with brain metastases.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 3 weeks. Quality of life and
      neurocognitive function is assessed before study, at completion of radiotherapy, and at 1
      month after completion of radiotherapy. Patients are followed at 1 month.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study over 5 months.
