TITLE:
EPO906 Therapy in Patients With Advanced Ovarian, Primary Fallopian, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer

CONDITION:
Ovarian Neoplasms

INTERVENTION:
epothilone b

SUMMARY:

      This study will examine whether the new investigational drug EPO906, given by intravenous
      infusion (IV directly into the vein), is effective in shrinking tumors and preventing the
      growth of cells that cause ovarian, fallopian, or peritoneal cancers. Recruitment in the
      United States is complete but the study is still enrolling in other countries.
