TITLE:
Study Comparing Weekly Taxol and Carboplatin vs Standard Taxol and Carboplatin Regimen for Stage IIIB or IV Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer

CONDITION:
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung

INTERVENTION:
Paclitaxel and carboplatin

SUMMARY:

      Taxol and carboplatin are commonly used drugs for the treatment of stage IIIB or IV non
      small cell lung carcinoma.

      This study compares treatment with Taxol/carboplatin given every 3 weeks to a schedule where
      it is given weekly.

      The purpose of the study is to determine the most effective and safe schedule for giving
      these drugs in non small cell lung carcinoma.
