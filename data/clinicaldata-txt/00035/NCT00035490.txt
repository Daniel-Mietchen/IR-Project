TITLE:
Efficacy and Safety Evaluation of Azimilide Dihydrochloride in Patients With Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators

CONDITION:
Arrhythmia

INTERVENTION:
Azimilide Dihydrochloride

SUMMARY:

      Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) have been developed to treat ventricular
      tachycardia or fibrillation (abnormal heart rhythms) by electrical shock or by pacing the
      heart. ICD therapy is established as highly effective for stopping life-threatening
      arrhythmias, but it does not preclude the use of anti-arrhythmic drugs for prevention and to
      decrease the frequency of ICD shocks.

      The safety and effectiveness of oral azimilide dihydrochloride in reducing the frequency of
      ICD shocks has been investigated previously in a placebo-controlled study in patients with
      ICDs. These results need to be confirmed in this larger double-blind, placebo-controlled
      study with approximately 600 patients.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
NONE

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 18 Years to N/A
Criteria:

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Currently have an ICD implanted

          -  Have had a documented episode of symptomatic arrhythmias that triggered a spontaneous
             ICD shock within 180 days of randomization.

          -  If the ICD implant is recent, the patient must have had a documented episode of
             sustained arrhythmias or cardiac arrest within 42 days before implantation of the ICD

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  have severe heart failure

          -  have a current diagnosis of psychosis

          -  use illicit drugs

          -  abuse alcohol

          -  if female, are currently breast feeding, or plan to become pregnant during the study

          -  are currently taking antiarrhythmic drugs or other drugs that prolong the QTc
             interval (a measurement taken from the ECG)

          -  creatinine >2.5 mg/dL (221 mmol/L)

          -  potassium <4.0 mEq or >5.5 mEq

          -  have a neutrophil count (ANC) < 100 mL (low count of a type of white blood cell) at
             time of randomization

          -  have 2 or more consecutive QTc values >440 msec
