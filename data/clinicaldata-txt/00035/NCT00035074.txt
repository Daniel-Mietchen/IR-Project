TITLE:
A Pharmacokinetic Study to Determine the Oral Bioavailability of Methotrexate in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease

CONDITION:
Inflammatory Bowel Disease

INTERVENTION:
Methotrexate

SUMMARY:

      Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who require methotrexate (MTX)for treatment
      currently receive this drug by injection. MTX is also available as a pill that can be given
      by mouth but it is not known how well the drug enters the body in patients with Crohn's
      disease or ulcerative colitis. This study is being done to compare how much MTX enters the
      body when the drug is taken by mouth compared to when it is given by injection. If the drug
      is well absorbed, it may allow patients to receive the drug by mouth.
