TITLE:
Pegfilgrastim as Support to Advanced Breast Cancer Patients Receiving Chemotherapy

CONDITION:
Neutropenia

INTERVENTION:
pegfilgrastim

SUMMARY:

      Physicians are conducting a clinical trial for patients with advanced breast cancer. Breast
      cancer can be treated with chemotherapy which can affect the bone marrow, where blood cells
      are produced. Neutrophils are a type of white blood cells that fight infection and are
      produced in the bone marrow. If the neutrophil count becomes low due to chemotherapy, a
      potentially serious condition called neutropenia occurs. Neutropenia is serious because it
      can affect the body's ability to protect against many types of infections. Pegfilgrastim is
      an investigational drug being evaluated for its potential ability to increase the number of
      neutrophils. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of
      pegfilgrastim in preventing neutropenia following chemotherapy in patients with advanced
      breast cancer.
