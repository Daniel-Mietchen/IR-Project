TITLE:
Premenopausal Endocrine Responsive Chemotherapy Trial

CONDITION:
Breast Cancer

INTERVENTION:
chemotherapy

SUMMARY:

      The PERCHE trial evaluated the worth of adding adjuvant chemotherapy for premenopausal women
      with steroid hormone receptor positive early invasive breast cancer who receive ovarian
      function suppression plus either tamoxifen or exemestane for five years. The use of
      chemotherapy was determined by randomization. The method of ovarian function suppression
      (GnRH analogue for five years, surgical oophorectomy or ovarian irradiation) and the choice
      of tamoxifen or exemestane were determined by the investigator or by randomization in the
      IBCSG 25-02 TEXT trial [recommended option]. The trial was terminated early due to poor
      accrual.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare ovarian function suppression and tamoxifen or exemestane with vs without
           adjuvant chemotherapy in premenopausal women with endocrine-responsive resected breast
           cancer.

        -  Compare the disease-free and overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare sites of first treatment failure in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the incidence of second nonbreast malignancies in patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Compare the quality of life, including late side effects of early menopause, of
           patients treated with these regimens.

      PLANNED OUTLINE:

      This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to participating
      center, number of positive axillary and/or internal mammary lymph nodes (0 vs 1 or more),
      method of ovarian function suppression (triptorelin vs oophorectomy vs ovarian irradiation),
      chemotherapy if randomized to arm II (not containing vs containing an anthracycline or
      taxane), and endocrine agent (tamoxifen vs exemestane vs selected by subsequent
      randomization in the TEXT trial). Treatment duration is five years.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually for 4
      years. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 5 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      NOTE: Trial was terminated early due to poor accrual.
