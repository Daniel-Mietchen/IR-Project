TITLE:
Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Ovarian Epithelial, Primary Peritoneal, or Fallopian Tube Cancer

CONDITION:
Fallopian Tube Cancer

INTERVENTION:
NY-ESO-1 peptide vaccine

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial to studying the side effects of vaccine therapy in treating
      patients with ovarian epithelial, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety of NY-ESO-1b peptide vaccine and Montanide ISA-51 in patients with
           ovarian epithelial, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer expressing NY-ESO-1 or
           LAGE-1.

        -  Determine the immunologic profile (NY-ESO-1 antibody, CD8+ cells, and delayed-type
           hypersensitivity) induced by this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive NY-ESO-1b peptide vaccine emulsified with Montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously
      once every 3 weeks on weeks 1, 4, 7, 10, and 13 in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 3 weeks and then every 6-12 weeks for 2 years or until disease
      progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9 patients will be accrued for this study.
