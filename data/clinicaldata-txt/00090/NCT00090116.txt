TITLE:
The Safety and Efficacy of Neramexane in Patients With Moderate to Severe Alzheimer's Disease

CONDITION:
Alzheimer's Disease

INTERVENTION:
Neramexane

SUMMARY:

      Memory loss and difficulties with thinking associated with Alzheimer's disease may be due to
      chronic release of a brain chemical called glutamate. Glutamate helps transmit messages
      between nerve cells through interaction with a certain type of receptor
      (N-methyl-D-aspartate, NMDA) on the cell. Neramexane is a new drug that blocks the effects
      of excessive glutamate at the receptor (NMDA receptor antagonist).
