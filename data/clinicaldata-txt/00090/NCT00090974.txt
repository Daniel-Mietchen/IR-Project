TITLE:
Quality of Life in Postmenopausal Women Who Are Receiving Either Exemestane or Anastrozole With or Without Celecoxib for Stage I, Stage II, or Stage IIIA Primary Breast Cancer

CONDITION:
Breast Cancer

INTERVENTION:
quality-of-life assessment

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Quality-of-life assessment in postmenopausal women who are receiving hormone
      therapy for breast cancer may help to determine the effects of treatment on these patients
      and may improve the quality of life for future breast cancer patients.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying quality of life of postmenopausal women who are
      receiving either exemestane or anastrozole with or without celecoxib for stage I, stage II,
      or stage IIIA primary breast cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare treatment-related symptoms using the Functional Assessment of Cancer
           Therapy-Endocrine Symptoms (FACT-ES) questionnaire in postmenopausal women with
           receptor-positive stage I, II, or IIIA primary breast cancer undergoing treatment with
           exemestane vs anastrozole with or without celecoxib on protocol CAN-NCIC-MA27.

      Secondary

        -  Compare health-related quality of life using the FACT-ES questionnaire in patients
           treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the extent to which differences in treatment-emergent symptoms affect overall
           quality of life in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, companion study. Patients receive treatment on
      CAN-NCIC-MA27.

      Health-related quality of life and treatment-related symptoms are assessed using the
      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Endocrine Symptoms (FACT-ES) questionnaire at
      baseline and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,253 patients will be accrued for this study.
