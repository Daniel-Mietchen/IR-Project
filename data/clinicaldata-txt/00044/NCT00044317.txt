SUMMARY:

      This study was designed to follow a group of adolescents who were previously examined by
      questionnaire and pulmonary function tests when they were aged 8-10 years old. Approximately
      50% of the population in 10 towns were seen again at age 17-18. Questionnaires and pulmonary
      function were repeated. The hypotheses being tested related to whether the previously seen
      levels of pulmonary function that were related to pollution levels in the towns persisted as
      the lungs of these children grew and whether dietary antioxidants influences level of
      attained pulmonary function.
