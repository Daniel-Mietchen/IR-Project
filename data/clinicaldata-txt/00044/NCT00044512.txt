TITLE:
A Study to Estimate Safety and Efficacy of Sorafenib (BAY43-9006) in the Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma

CONDITION:
Carcinoma, Hepatocellular

INTERVENTION:
Sorafenib (Nexavar, BAY43-9006)

SUMMARY:

      Evaluate anti-cancer activity (e.g. proportion of patients with confirmed complete response
      or partial response) in patients with advanced, inoperable biopsy-proven hepatocellular
      carcinoma.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      In addition to the key secondary outcome parameters the following exploratory parameters
      were evaluated in subpopulations:

        -  Pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of Sorafenib

        -  Plasma and tissue tumor biomarkers
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 18 Years to N/A
Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Inoperable disease (T2-T4, any N, M0 or M1) or refused surgery

          -  Measurable disease

          -  At least 1 bidimensionally measurable lesion of at least 2 cm by computed tomography
             (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

          -  Presence of at least 1 of the following:

          -  Alpha-fetoprotein greater than the upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  Hepatitis C antibody positive

          -  Hepatitis B surface antigen positive

          -  Child's Pugh class A or B

          -  Candidate for systemic therapy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Fibrolamellar disease mixed histology

          -  Metastatic brain or meningeal tumors
