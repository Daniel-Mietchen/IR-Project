TITLE:
Study Comparing the Safety and Efficacy of Piperacillin/Tazobactam to Cefepime in Patients With Hematologic Malignancy or Lymphoma

CONDITION:
Hematologic Neoplasms

INTERVENTION:
Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Tazocin)

SUMMARY:

      To compare the safety and efficacy of piperacillin/tazobactam (4 g/500 mg) administered
      intravenously every 6 hours to cefepime (2 g) administered intravenously every 8 hours for
      the empiric treatment of neutropenic fever in patients with a hematologic malignancy or
      lymphoma.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
NONE

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 18 Years to N/A
Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria:

             leukemia [AML], chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL], chronic myelogenous leukemia
             [CML]), that is newly diagnosed, who have had initial induction, re-induction, or
             intensification chemotherapy or who have had a bone marrow (allogenic, syngeneic, or
             autologous) or peripheral blood stem-cell transplant OR Patients with lymphoma,
             Hodgkin's disease, multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndrome or myelodysplasia
             (refractory anemia [RA], refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts [RARS],
             refractory anemia with excess blasts [RAEB], refractory anemia with excess blasts in
             transformation to leukemia [RAEB-T], or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [CMML].

          -  Fever, defined as an oral temperature of  37.9C /100.2F, a rectal temperature 
             38.4C /101.4F, or a tympanic temperature  38C /100.4F

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The presence of any clinically acute or chronic disease or condition that, in the
             opinion of the investigator, may interfere with the patient's ability to safely
             comply with the conditions of the protocol, or could preclude the evaluation of the
             patient's response or could make the completion of the therapy unlikely

          -  Neutropenia associated with syndromes that are not associated with a high risk of
             bacterial infection (eg. chronic benign neutropenia or Kostmann's syndrome)

          -  Neutropenia due to primary bone marrow failure
