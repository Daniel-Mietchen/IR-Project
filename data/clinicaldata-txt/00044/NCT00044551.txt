TITLE:
Evaluation of Bay 59-8862 in Patients With Aggressive, Refractory Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma

CONDITION:
Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin

INTERVENTION:
Taxane (Cytotoxic, BAY59-8862)

SUMMARY:

      Almost two-thirds of lymphoma cases are Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas (NHL). NHL is a malignant
      process that affects lymphoid cells found both in the lymph nodes and extranodally.
      Incidence and mortality rates from NHL are highest in developed countries. While many
      patients with aggressive NHL are curable with initial anthracycline-containing regimens, the
      majority of patients will relapse or prove refractory to initial therapy. The prognosis of
      patients with disease recurrence following a multidrug regimen is also limited. The current
      protocol is designed to test the safety and efficacy of BAY 59-8862 in patients with
      Aggressive Refractory Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.
