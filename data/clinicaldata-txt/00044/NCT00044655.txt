TITLE:
Switching Medication to Treat Schizophrenia

CONDITION:
Schizophrenia

INTERVENTION:
Risperidone

SUMMARY:

      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of switching medications in decreasing
      schizophrenia symptoms in individuals who are currently taking an antipsychotic medication
      for the treatment of schizophrenia.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Over the past several years, new, "atypical" antipsychotic medications have become available
      to treat schizophrenia with little information to guide prescribing for relatively stable
      outpatients.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to either continue taking their current medications
      for schizophrenia, or to switch to a new medication. Participants assigned to switch to a
      new medication will begin receiving either olanzapine (Zyprexa), risperidone (Risperdal),
      ziprasidone (Geodon), quetiapine (Seroquel), or aripiprazole (Abilify), depending on what
      they are currently taking. Participants currently taking a single oral medication will
      switch to olanzapine, risperidone, ziprasidone, quetiapine, or aripiprazole. Participants
      currently taking a single conventional injectable will begin taking long-acting injectable
      risperidone (Risperdal Consta). Participants currently taking two antipsychotic medications
      will begin taking only one of the medications they are currently using. Participants will
      stay on their assigned treatment for 6 months, after which time the participant's
      prescribing psychiatrist will advise the participant on which medication should be used.
      Study participants are interviewed at study start and at follow-up visits for 1 year.
