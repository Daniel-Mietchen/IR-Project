TITLE:
Phase III Study of Atamestane Plus Toremifene Versus Letrozole in Advanced Breast Cancer

CONDITION:
Breast Neoplasms

INTERVENTION:
atamestane

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the first line combination hormonal
      therapy of an experimental drug, atamestane, plus an FDA-approved drug, toremifene
      (Fareston), is more effective than another approved drug, letrozole (Femara), in delaying
      the growth of breast cancer in postmenopausal patients with locally advanced or metastatic
      breast cancer, and whether the side effects of the combination are different from the side
      effects of letrozole.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Breast cancer cells are often very dependent on estrogens to continue to grow. Atamestane
      blocks the formation of estrogens and androgenic precursors in the body. Toremifene blocks
      circulating and intracellular estrogens from stimulating estrogen receptors in breast cancer
      cells. The goal of therapy with atamestane, an aromatase inhibitor, in combination with the
      estrogen receptor antagonist, toremifene, is to achieve maximal suppression of estrogen
      stimulation of breast cancer cells. This study is designed to determine whether combination
      therapy will lengthen the time to disease progression and the rate of objective response
      compared to single agent aromatase inhibitor therapy with letrozole.

             the time of metastases

          -  ECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2 or Karnofsky performance status of 60 or higher

          -  Predicted life expectancy of 12 weeks or more

             radiation therapy or surgery and/or distant metastatic disease

          -  At least one tumor localization measurable in 2 dimensions (one diameter at least 2
             cm for soft tissue/visceral disease assessed by CT/MRI scan or conventional X-ray
             technique, one diameter at least 1 cm for bone lesions assessed by conventional X-ray
             techniques)

          -  Estrogen receptor and/or progesterone receptor positive (by laboratory/institutional
             standard) at the time of initial diagnosis or determined during subsequent
             biopsy/surgery of metastases

          -  Written informed consent obtained

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior hormonal therapy to treat locally recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic
             disease

          -  Prior adjuvant therapy with aromatase inhibitors or antiestrogens/SERMs within 12
             months prior to enrollment

          -  Progression of disease during therapy with antiestrogens (including SERMs
             administered for prevention of osteoporosis)

          -  Life-threatening locally recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic disease or disease
             requiring chemotherapeutic intervention (such as inflammatory breast cancer)

          -  History of known CNS metastases, significant neurological dysfunction including
             active seizures, or clinical signs of other significant neurological diseases

          -  Other active malignancy (except basal cell carcinoma of the skin or in situ cervical
             cancer). Patients with previous malignancies must be without evidence of disease for
             at least five years

          -  Renal insufficiency (serum creatinine > 2.0 mg/dL)

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase or serum bilirubin levels more
             than 2.5 times upper limit of normal

          -  Hemoglobin <9 g/dL

          -  Platelet count of less than 100,000 platelets per mm3

          -  Total white blood cell count of less than 2,000 cells per mm3

          -  Premenopausal endocrine status; pregnant or lactating females

          -  Usage of an investigational drug within the thirty (30) days prior to enrollment; or
             the planned usage of an investigational drug other than the study medication during
             the course of the current study

          -  Contraindication to use of toremifene, atamestane, letrozole or any of the inactive
             components of their formulations

          -  Prior enrollment in this study
