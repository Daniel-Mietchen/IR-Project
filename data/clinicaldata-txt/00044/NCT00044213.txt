TITLE:
Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy (TACT)

CONDITION:
Coronary Artery Disease

INTERVENTION:
EDTA

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of ethylene diamine
      tetra-acetic (EDTA) chelation therapy in individuals with coronary artery disease.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      EDTA chelation therapy involves repeated administrations of a synthetic amino acid to reduce
      atherosclerotic plaque and other mineral deposits throughout the cardiovascular system.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive 40 infusions of either the standard
      chelation solution or placebo. The primary endpoint of this trial will be a composite of all
      cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, and
      hospitalization for angina.

      The results of TACT will provide either a significant positive result or an informative null
      result upon which rational clinical decision-making and health policy can be based.
