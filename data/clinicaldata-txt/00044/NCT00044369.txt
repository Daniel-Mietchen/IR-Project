TITLE:
Role of the Toxic Metal Cadmium in the Mechanism Producing Infertility With a Varicocele

CONDITION:
Varicocele

INTERVENTION:
Varicocele repair

SUMMARY:

      Varicose veins in the scrotum (varicocele) are responsible for >20% of male infertility in
      the US. Varicocele are associated with decreased sperm number and markedly reduced sperm
      fertilizing ability. Surgical repair or removal of varicocele restores fertility in only 1/3
      of cases. The goal of this study is to identify markers that predict the outcome of
      variocele correction. This would offer considerable health cost savings.

      Based on preliminary findings, we will obtain testis biopsies and semen specimens from
      infertile men with varicocele and prospectively examining the levels of cadmium, a toxic
      metal, and expression of genes required for normal sperm function. The semen and biopsies
      will be obtained during clinically dictated procedures. Cadmium and gene expression will be
      compared with response to varicocele repair (i.e., increased sperm production; pregnancy).
