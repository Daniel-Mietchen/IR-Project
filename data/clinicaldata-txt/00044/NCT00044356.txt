TITLE:
Phase II Trial of Allovectin-7 for Metastatic Melanoma

CONDITION:
Melanoma

INTERVENTION:
Allovectin-7

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this clinical trial is to determine if Allovectin-7, an experimental
      gene-based immunotherapy, can shrink melanoma tumors. The trial will also examine if this
      treatment can improve the time to disease progression.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Treatment - If you take part in this trial you will be treated for about 10 weeks. You will
      receive an injection of Allovectin-7 by needle, directly into one or more selected tumors
      once a week for the first six weeks. The injections may be given in a doctor's office.
      During a four-week observation period, your disease will be measured to see if the treatment
      is working. This will be done by general physical exams and scans (such as X-ray scans).
      Patients who show no sign of disease progression may be offered an option to repeat this
      treatment course.
