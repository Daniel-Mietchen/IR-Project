TITLE:
Living-Related Donor Bone Marrow Immunoregulation in Kidney Transplants

CONDITION:
Kidney Disease

INTERVENTION:
donor bone marrow infusion

SUMMARY:

      Diabetes and end-stage kidney, liver and heart disease are prominent health issues among
      veteran patients. Successful solid organ transplantation in the absence of chronic
      immunosuppressive therapy (specific acquired immunological tolerance) is a desirable
      therapeutic option. This project extends recent observations supporting the use of
      concommitant donor bone marrow cell infusion as a means of modulating the immune response in
      kidney transplantation, thereby allowing a substantial decrease or withdrawal of potentially
      toxic immunosuppressive drugs.
