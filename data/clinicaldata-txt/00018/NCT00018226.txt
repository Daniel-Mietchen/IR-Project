TITLE:
Effect Of Case Management Following Discharge From Methadone Treatment

CONDITION:
Opioid-Related Disorders

INTERVENTION:
Case Management

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this project is to assess whether enhanced outreach counseling (EOC) is an
      effective outreach strategy for discharged methadone maintenance patients compared to a
      standard referral procedure. EOC is a brief (30 minute) face-to-face intervention, followed
      by six weeks of ongoing telephone counseling/case management designed to help eligible
      out-of-treatment methadone patients re-enter treatment. Several studies have shown those
      patients who voluntarily re-enter treatment improve significantly following re-enrollment.
