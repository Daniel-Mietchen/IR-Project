TITLE:
Calcifidol Therapy in Men With Cancer

CONDITION:
Prostate Cancer

INTERVENTION:
calcifidiol

SUMMARY:

      Prostate cancer is a common occurrence in the aging population, with one in ten men destined
      to develop the disease. 40% of patients with prostate cancer experience a recurrence after
      definitive treatment. This study addresses the as-yet unresolved problem of the optimal
      management of early recurrence as manifested by increase in the accepted marker for this
      disease, PSA. Vitamin D, an agent with cell-differentiating properties, has been shown to
      inhibit angiogenesis and cause differentiation of prostate cancer cells in the laboratory
      and to affect PSA favorably in clinical studies of patients with advanced prostate cancer.
      This study will assess the effects of vitamin D in patients with sub-clinical biochemical
      relapses of prostate cancer as indicated by rising PSA but low tumor burdens, with the
      potential for developing an approach to this problem that will delay or prevent progression.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
NONE

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: Male
Age: N/A to N/A
Criteria:

        Patients will be males with three successive rises in PSA after achieving a nadir
        post-definitive therapy. The following criteria must be met: pathologically confirmed
        prostate cancer, completion of definitive treatment in the form of local external beam
        radiation or definitive surgery and three successive rises in PSA with no clinical
        evidence of disease.
