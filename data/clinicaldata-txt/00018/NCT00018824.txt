TITLE:
Treating Alcohol Use In Older Adults With Depression

CONDITION:
Alcoholism

INTERVENTION:
NALTREXONE

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy combining a treatment for depression with
      a treatment for alcohol dependence.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      This study aims to study 80 patients with comorbid alcohol dependence and a depressive
      syndrome. After appropriate detoxification, patients are started on either naltrexone 50 mg
      or placebo. After one week, sertraline is added in an open label fashion. It is hypothesized
      that those patients receiving combination therapy will last 3 months with follow-up tracking
      lasting 1 year.
