TITLE:
Follow-up of Psychological and Neurocognitive Gulf War Outcome: Relation to Stress

CONDITION:
Gulf War Syndrome

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      This is the follow-up to an observational epidemiological study of psychological and
      neuropsychological outcomes of deployed and non-deployed Gulf War-era veterans.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Approximately 800 deployed and 250 nondeployed veterans were originally administered
      psychological assessment instruments shortly after the cessation of the Gulf War. These
      veterans are currently being followed to evaluate longer-term psychological outcomes in
      relation to war-zone stress, intervening life stress, and individual difference factors and
      personal resources, such as coping and social support.

      Approximately 75 of these veterans, oversampled for post-traumatic stress disorder, were
      administered a specialized neuropsychological battery emphasizing attention and memory. This
      sample will also be followed to evaluate longitudinal neuropsychological outcome in relation
      to PTSD status.

      A cross-sectional study will also be conducted examining visual, hierarchical attention in
      relation to PTSD diagnosis.
