TITLE:
Electrophysiologic Measures of Treatment Response in Alzheimer Disease

CONDITION:
Alzheimer Disease

INTERVENTION:
Aricept

SUMMARY:

      The main purpose of this study is to determine the electrophysiological effects of
      cholinergic therapy (cholinesterase inhibitors and transdermal nicotine) in Alzheimer
      disease. The attempt will be to locate electrophysiological markers and predictors of
      cognitive and clinical treatment response.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
NONE

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 55 Years to 85 Years
Criteria:

        Patients diagnosed with mild to moderate probable Alzheimer's disease (mini-mental state
        exam scores between 15-27), and normal controls (age generally between 60-85). Subjects
        must either be planning to start daily cholinesterase therapy (e.g. Aricept, Exelon) or
        willing to try a transdermal nicotine patch for two 8 hour periods.
