TITLE:
A Study to Evaluate and Compare Alendronate and Risedronate on Bone Mineral Density in Women With Postmenopausal Osteoporosis (MK-0217-211)

CONDITION:
Postmenopausal Osteoporosis

INTERVENTION:
Alendronate

SUMMARY:

      This study is to evaluate and compare the effects of Alendronate and Risedronate to treat
      women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. The primary hypothesis for this study is that in
      postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, treatment with oral alendronate 70 mg once weekly
      will produce a mean percent increase from baseline in hip trochanter bone mineral density
      (BMD) at 12 and 24 months which is greater than that observed with oral risedronate 35 mg
      once weekly.
