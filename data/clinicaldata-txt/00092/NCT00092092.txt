TITLE:
Study of Montelukast and Its Effect on Lower Leg Growth in Children With Asthma (MK-0476-254)

CONDITION:
Asthma, Bronchial

INTERVENTION:
Montelukast chewable tablets

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of montelukast, an approved medication,
      on the lower leg growth rate in children with mild asthma. The primary hypothesis is that
      the lower leg length (LLL) growth rate for children treated with montelukast compared to
      placebo will be established.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      This is a crossover study that consists of a 2-week placebo run-in period, then a first
      3-week treatment period, then a 2-week washout period, and then a second 3-week treatment
      period. Participants will be randomized to treatment with either montelukast and placebo or
      budesonide and placebo. The duration of treatment is 6 weeks.
