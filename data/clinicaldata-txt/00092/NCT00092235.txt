TITLE:
Factors Determining Outcomes in Patients With Graft-Versus-Host Disease

CONDITION:
Chronic Graft vs Host Disease

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      Background:

        -  Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a multi-organ alloimmune and autoimmune
           disorder that occurs following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
           (alloHSCT). It is characterized by immune dysregulation, immunodeficiency, impaired
           organ function, and decreased survival.

        -  Each year about 7000 patients receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant
           (alloHSCT) in North America and about 50% of patients who are transplanted develop
           cGVHD.

        -  Chronic GVHD is also a disorder that simultaneously affects many organ systems in
           highly variable fashion and requires complex and coordinated medical management by
           multiple medical specialties. There is an urgent need for progress in understanding and
           effective treatments for cGVHD as it is one of the most serious complications of cancer
           therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

      Objectives:

        -  To establish a multidisciplinary clinic infrastructure for study of the pathogenesis
           and natural history of cGVHD.

        -  To prospectively identify clinical and biological prognostic markers in patients with
           cGVHD.

        -  To develop clinically relevant cGVHD grading scales.

        -  To identify novel biological characteristics of cGVHD and to describe them in the
           context of clinical history and presentation.

        -  To identify potential clinical and biological markers of cGVHD activity.

        -  To improve understanding of the biology of cGVHD-associated graft-versus-tumor effects.

      Eligibility:

      -Patients age 1-75 referred by the primary transplant physician for the evaluation of
      chronic graft-versus-host disease independent of underlying diagnosis.

      Design:

        -  Patient undergoes initial clinical and labotory multispecialty work-up at the NCI cGVHD
           clinic.

        -  Minimally invasive biopsies and rarely, deep tissue biopsy may be obtained to confirm
           the diagnosis and/or rule-out other pathologic process (in adults only).

        -  Long tem data collection for evaluation of long-term outcomes will be conducted every
           six months during the first three years of the study and then yearly.

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 1 Year to 75 Years
Criteria:

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Any patient age 1-75 referred by the primary transplant physician for the
                  evaluation of chronic graft-versus-host disease independently of age or
                  underlying diagnosis;

               2. Patient or the patient's legal representative is able and willing to provide
                  consent.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Significant medical condition or any other significant circumstance that could in the
             PIs assessment affect the patient's ability to tolerate, comply, or complete the
             study;

          2. Patients who in the PIs assessment have a life expectancy less than 3 months.

        Note: Because it is not always possible to make a clear clinical distinction between acute
        and chronic GVHD, patients with acute GVHD are not a-priori excluded until the possibility
        of chronic GVHD is reliably excluded on the basis of the clinical assessments in the cGVHD
        clinic.
