TITLE:
Herbal Treatment of Hepatitis C in Methadone Maintained Patients

CONDITION:
Hepatitis C

INTERVENTION:
Herbal remedies

SUMMARY:

      Hepatitis C (HCV) is a chronic viral illness leading to progressive liver damage that has
      emerged as a major public health issue in the United States. While HCV affects all
      population groups, individuals with a history of intravenous drug use form the largest known
      risk group. Between 90 and 100 percent of long term intravenous drug use will eventually
      test positive for HCV, and there is substantial risk that even short term experimentation
      will result in infection. Studies suggest that HCV will be the major cause of cirrhosis and
      liver cancer in the next century. Currently, approved therapy includes recombinant
      interferons, which lead to sustained remission in a minority of patients. However, patients
      abusing other substances, including alcohol, are not eligible for interferon therapy. The
      need for investigation into other potential therapies is clear. Current practice patterns in
      the Far East include the use of traditional herbal remedies for symptomatic chronic viral
      hepatitis. This study is intended to examine the effect of commonly used herbal remedies for
      the treatment of symptomatic HCV.
