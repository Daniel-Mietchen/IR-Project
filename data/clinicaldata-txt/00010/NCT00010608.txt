TITLE:
Clinical Trial of Meditation for Cardiovascular Disease in Older Black Women

CONDITION:
Cardiovascular Diseases

INTERVENTION:
Transcendental Meditation

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of meditation in preventing of
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) in postmenopausal, older African American
      women.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Older African American women suffer from disproportionately high rates of cardiovascular
      (CVD) morbidity and mortality compared to white Americans. Numerous controlled studies
      suggest that this disparity is associated with chronic psychosocial and environmental
      stress. Research indicates that Transcendental Meditation (TM) may result in significant
      improvements in CVD risk factors in this high risk population.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to either active stress reduction with
      TM or health education control, both in addition to usual medical care, for 12 months. The
      primary outcome will be carotid artery atherosclerosis (IMT) measured non-invasively by
      quantitative B-mode ultrasonography. Secondary measures will include traditional CVD risk
      factors (blood pressure, serum glucose and insulin levels, obesity, and sedentary
      lifestyle), stress-related neurohormones (catecholamine metabolite and cortisol),
      psychosocial stress, and quality of life. The results of this trial will yield valuable new
      knowledge for the prevention of CVD through a CAM intervention in high risk older African
      American women.
