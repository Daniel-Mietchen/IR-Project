TITLE:
This is an Early Study to Investigate the Effect of Gimatecan in Adults With Solid Tumor

CONDITION:
Solid Malignancies

INTERVENTION:
Gimatecan (ST-1481)

SUMMARY:

      Gimatecan is sigma-tau Research's new, potent, oral Topoisomerase I inhibitor. Drugs in
      this class play a crucial role in destroying DNA replication in tumors. We are conducting
      this study to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose of our compound, when given as a capsule,
      rather than by intravenous injection.
