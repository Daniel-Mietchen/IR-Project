TITLE:
CCI-779 in Treating Patients With Mantle Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma

CONDITION:
Recurrent Mantle Cell Lymphoma

INTERVENTION:
temsirolimus

SUMMARY:

      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of CCI-779 in treating patients who have mantle
      cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer
      cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the objective responses in patients with previously treated mantle cell
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with CCI-779.

      II. Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients. III. Determine whether this
      drug inhibits cell proliferation pathways in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive CCI-779 IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable
      disease receive a maximum of 6 courses. Patients with partial response receive a maximum of
      12 courses. Patients with complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses beyond CR.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months
      for 1 year, and then annually for 2 years.
