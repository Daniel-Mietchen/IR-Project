TITLE:
Celecoxib in Preventing Cancer in Patients at High Risk for Ovarian Epithelial Cancer Who Are Undergoing Prophylactic Oophorectomy

CONDITION:
brca1 Mutation Carrier

INTERVENTION:
celecoxib

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the
      development or recurrence of cancer. The use of celecoxib before prophylactic oophorectomy
      may be an effective way to prevent the development of ovarian epithelial cancer.

      PURPOSE: A controlled pilot trial to study the effectiveness of celecoxib in preventing
      cancer in patients at high-risk for ovarian epithelial cancer who are undergoing
      prophylactic oophorectomy.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare histologic and molecular alterations in tissue biomarkers of patients at high
           risk for ovarian cancer treated with celecoxib followed by prophylactic oophorectomy vs
           prophylactic oophorectomy only.

      Secondary

        -  Compare alterations in gene expression pattern in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

        -  Group I: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily for 3 months and then undergo
           prophylactic oophorectomy.

        -  Group II: Patients undergo immediate prophylactic oophorectomy.

Criteria:

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  At high risk for ovarian cancer and meets criteria for 1 of the following:

               -  Family history of at least 2 ovarian** or breast cancers* among the patient and
                  first- or second-degree relatives in the same lineage

                    -  Multiple primary cancers in the same person may fulfill this requirement

               -  Ashkenazi Jewish ethnicity AND 1 first-degree or 2 second-degree relatives with
                  breast* or ovarian** cancer

               -  Ashkenazi Jewish ethnicity AND had prior breast cancer*

                  status unknown); ductal carcinoma in situ qualifies as breast cancer
