TITLE:
Neoadjuvant Cetuximab, Fluorouracil, and Pelvic Irradiation in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Locally Recurrent Rectal Cancer

CONDITION:
Colorectal Cancer

INTERVENTION:
cetuximab

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as cetuximab can locate tumor cells and either kill
      them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy such as fluorouracil work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor
      cells. Giving cetuximab with fluorouracil and radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the safety profile of neoadjuvant cetuximab, fluorouracil, and pelvic
           irradiation in patients with locally advanced or locally recurrent rectal cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the activity of this regimen, in terms of pathological complete response
           rate, in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, open-label, pilot study.

      Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 50, 57, and
      64 and fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-42. Patients undergo whole-pelvic radiotherapy
      once daily on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, and 36-40. Treatment continues in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Approximately 1-3 weeks after completion of study treatment, patients undergo surgical
      resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy off-study.

      Patients are followed for up to 5 years.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Histologically confirmed rectal adenocarcinoma meeting 1 of the following staging
             criteria:

               -  Locally advanced disease

                    -  Resectable (uT3) disease

                         -  Primary gross transmural tumor that is not adherent to adjacent pelvic
                            structures by endorectal ultrasound

                    -  Primary tethered or unresectable (cT4 or uT4) disease

                         -  Primary tumor is contiguous with or adherent or fixed to adjacent
                            pelvic structures by clinical exam and CT scan
