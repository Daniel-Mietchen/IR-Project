TITLE:
Neoadjuvant Letrozole in Treating Postmenopausal Women With Estrogen-Receptor Positive and/or Progesterone-Receptor Positive Stage II, Stage IIIA, or Stage IIIB Breast Cancer

CONDITION:
Breast Cancer

INTERVENTION:
letrozole

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Estrogen can stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using
      letrozole may fight breast cancer by reducing the production of estrogen. Giving letrozole
      before surgery may shrink the tumor so that it can be removed.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well neoadjuvant letrozole works in treating
      postmenopausal women who are undergoing surgery for estrogen-receptor positive or
      progesterone-receptor positive stage II, stage IIIA, or stage IIIB breast cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Develop a predictive model of response (based on gene expression profiling) in
           postmenopausal women with estrogen- and/or progesterone-receptor positive stage II,
           IIIA, or IIIB breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant letrozole.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine changes in Ki67 proliferation rates in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the rate of improvement in surgical outcomes in patients treated with this
           drug.

        -  Determine the long-term outcomes in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine mechanisms of resistance to this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive neoadjuvant oral letrozole once daily for 16 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression. Patients then undergo breast surgery one day after the last dose of
      letrozole. Patients with partial response after 16 weeks may continue to receive letrozole
      for an additional 8 weeks before undergoing breast surgery.

      Patients are followed within 4 weeks after definitive surgery and then annually for 10
      years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 150 patients will be accrued for this study.
