TITLE:
Nosocomial Pneumonia With Suspected Or Proven Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA)

CONDITION:
Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA)

INTERVENTION:
linezolid (Zyvox)

SUMMARY:

      To determine if linezolid is superior to vancomycin in the treatment of nosocomial (acquired
      in the hospital) pneumonia due to Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) in
      adult subjects. Subjects entered in to the study will have proven healthcare-associated
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia which will be treated with either
      linezolid or vancomycin.
