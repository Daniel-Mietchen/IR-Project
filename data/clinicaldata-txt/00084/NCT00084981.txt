TITLE:
Decitabine and Valproic Acid in Treating Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer

CONDITION:
Recurrent Non-small Cell Lung Cancer

INTERVENTION:
decitabine

SUMMARY:

      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of decitabine and valproic
      acid in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such
      as decitabine and valproic acid, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and tolerability of decitabine and valproic acid in patients with
      non-small cell lung cancer.

      II. Determine the recommended phase II dose of this regimen in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the ability of this regimen to lead to biological changes in tumor and
      surrogate tissues in these patients, including hypomethylation of target genes known to be
      methylated in NSCLC (CDKN2, APC, BMP3B, CDH1 and RASSF1A) in biopsy specimens and surrogate
      tissues (peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMC] and plasma/serum DNA); acetylation and
      methylation changes in histones from tumor and surrogate tissues (PBMC and oral epithelial
      cells); inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity in peripheral blood;
      pharmacokinetic analysis of Decitabine and Valproic Acid; DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1)
      protein loss in PBMC and buccal cells; response of hemoglobin F in patients with
      non-hematologic conditions to DNMT and HDAC inhibition; and preliminary evidence of
      antitumor activity in non-small cell lung cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive decitabine IV over 1 hour on days 1-10 and oral valproic acid three times
      daily on days 5-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of decitabine and valproic acid until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. After the MTD is
      determined, an additional 6 patients are treated at that dose.
