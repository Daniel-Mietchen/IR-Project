TITLE:
A 12-week, Multicenter, Safety and Dose-ranging Study of 3 Oral Doses of TCH346 in Patients With Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis

CONDITION:
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis

INTERVENTION:
TCH346

SUMMARY:

      This study is the first to be performed in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients with
      the novel compound TCH346. Its purpose is to evaluate the safety and clinical effects of 3
      dose levels of TCH 346 compared to placebo in patients with a clinical diagnosis of
      laboratory-supported probable, probable or definite ALS. The study will require patients to
      visit the study center a total of at least 7 times over the course of up to 14 weeks. The
      study consists of 2 phases: A screening phase (up to 2 weeks) when patients will be
      evaluated for eligibility to participate in the study, and a double-blind treatment phase
      (12 weeks) when patients will receive daily doses of either TCH346 or placebo and will be
      evaluated for clinical effects. In addition, patients eligible to participate in this study
      will be required to have 3 magnetic resonance spectroscopic (MRS) scans. The MRS is a
      non-invasive, painless, "brain scan". The MRS will require traveling to a designated center
      in Montreal, Canada, which is very experienced in performing such MRS scans in ALS patients.
