TITLE:
Arsenic Trioxide in Treating Men With Germ Cell Cancer

CONDITION:
Extragonadal Germ Cell Tumor

INTERVENTION:
arsenic trioxide

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of arsenic trioxide in treating men who
      have germ cell cancer that has not responded to previous treatment.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the response rate (confirmed complete and partial responses) in men with
           refractory testicular or extragonadal germ cell malignancies treated with arsenic
           trioxide.

        -  Determine the overall and progression-free survival of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this drug in these
           patients.

        -  Assess the biomarker response rate in patients with elevated biomarkers treated with
           this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 28
      days for up to 3 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients who achieve a confirmed complete or partial response receive up to 3 additional
      courses past response.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for 3 years or until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 10-40
      months.

Criteria:

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Histologically confirmed testicular or extragonadal germ cell cancer

          -  Refractory disease, defined by at least 1 of the following criteria:

               -  Disease progression during or within 4 weeks of cisplatin-containing regimen

                    -  Progression is defined as the appearance of new or progression of known
                       locally advanced or metastatic disease or a rise in tumor markers
                       (beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-HCG) or alpha fetoprotein (AFP))
                       by at least 50% relative to the nadir

                    -  When the only evidence of germ cell progression or recurrence before study
                       entry is the appearance of a new lesion in the absence of tumor marker
                       elevation, a biopsy is required to confirm the diagnosis

               -  Disease recurrence after at least 2 chemotherapy regimens, one of which includes
                  high-dose therapy (chemotherapy with stem cell support)

                  high-dose therapy

          -  At least 1 of the following:

               -  Unidimensionally measurable disease

                    -  Soft tissue, irradiated within the past 2 months, is not considered
                       measurable
