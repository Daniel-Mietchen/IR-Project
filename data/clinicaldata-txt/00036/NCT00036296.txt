TITLE:
Effects of Talampanel on Patients With Advanced Parkinson's Disease

CONDITION:
Dyskinesias

INTERVENTION:
talampanel

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety and effectiveness of the study
      drug, Talampanel, when used to treat patients with involuntary movements known as
      dyskinesias, as a result of treatment to Parkinson's disease.

      It is not clear why people with Parkinson's disease develop involuntary movements
      (dyskinesias) but studies show that blocking receptors in the brain for a chemical called
      glutamate decreases these movements. Talampanel is a drug which blocks these receptors.
