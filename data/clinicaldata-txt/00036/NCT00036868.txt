TITLE:
Combination Chemotherapy With Trastuzumab in Treating Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer

CONDITION:
Breast Cancer

INTERVENTION:
trastuzumab

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and
      fluorouracil use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, can locate tumor cells and either kill them
      or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Combining
      chemotherapy with trastuzumab may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining combination chemotherapy
      with trastuzumab in treating women who have metastatic breast cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the incidence of clinical heart failure in women with c-erbB2-positive
           metastatic breast cancer treated with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil
           in combination with trastuzumab (Herceptin).

        -  Compare the therapeutic activity of this regimen, in terms of objective response rate,
           in these patients.

        -  Compare the duration of response and time to progression in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Compare the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive CMF comprising cyclophosphamide orally on days 1-14 or IV on days 1 and 8
      and methotrexate IV and fluorouracil IV on days 1 and 8. Patients also receive trastuzumab
      (Herceptin) IV over 30-90 minutes once weekly beginning on day 1. Treatment repeats every 4
      weeks for 8 courses. Patients then receive trastuzumab once every 3 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient refusal.

      Patients are followed every 8 weeks until documentation of disease progression or initiation
      of a new anticancer therapy. Patients developing disease progression are followed every 12
      weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 66 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
