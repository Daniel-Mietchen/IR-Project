TITLE:
Temozolomide in Treating Patients With Brain Metastases

CONDITION:
Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors

INTERVENTION:
temozolomide

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of temozolomide in treating patients who
      have brain metastases.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the activity of temozolomide in patients with brain metastases.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this treatment in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to type of primary cancer (lung carcinoma vs
      breast carcinoma vs malignant melanoma vs renal cell carcinoma vs colorectal carcinoma vs
      other).

      Patients receive oral temozolomide daily on days 1-7 and 15-21. Treatment repeats every 28
      days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 180 patients (30 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.
