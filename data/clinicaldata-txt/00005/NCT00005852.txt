TITLE:
Bone Marrow Transplantation in Treating Patients With Severe Aplastic Anemia or Rejection of Previous Bone Marrow Transplant

CONDITION:
Chronic Myeloproliferative Disorders

INTERVENTION:
anti-thymocyte globulin

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Bone marrow from donors may be able to treat patients with severe aplastic anemia
      and patients whose bodies have rejected previous bone marrow transplantation.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bone marrow transplantation in
      treating patients who have severe aplastic anemia or whose bodies have rejected previous
      bone marrow transplant.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the graft failure rate and overall survival of patients with severe
      aplastic anemia after receiving an allogeneic bone marrow transplant. II. Determine the
      efficacy of high dose cyclophosphamide and antithymocyte globulin as conditioning regimen
      for a second bone marrow transplant in patients who reject their first graft. III. Determine
      the efficacy of methylprednisolone and anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody as a conditioning
      regimen for a second bone marrow transplant in patients who reject their first graft and are
      poor candidates for cyclophosphamide and antithymocyte globulin.

      OUTLINE: Patients with graft failure with the following organ function and performance
      status are assigned to arm I: Performance status: Karnofsky 60-100% Pulmonary: FEV1 and DLCO
      at least 50% Cardiac: Left ventricular ejection fraction at least 45% Hepatic: None to mild
      venoocclusive disease Patients with graft failure with the following organ function and
      performance status are assigned to arm II: Performance status: Karnofsky 20-50% Pulmonary:
      FEV1 or DLCO less than 50% Cardiac: Left ventricular ejection fraction less than 45%
      Hepatic: Moderate to severe venoocclusive disease Patients with aplastic anemia are assigned
      to arm I. Arm I: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -5 to -2,
      antithymocyte globulin IV over 8 hours on days -5 to -3, and bone marrow transplant on day
      0. Arm II: Patients receive methylprednisolone IV twice a day on days -5 to 62; monoclonal
      antibody OKT3 IV on days -1 to 24; bone marrow transplant on day 0; oral cyclosporine twice
      a day starting day 20; and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously once a day starting day -5
      until blood counts recover. Patients are followed once a week for 3 months and then monthly
      for one year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients (20 with aplastic anemia and 20 with graft
      failure) will be accrued for this study.
