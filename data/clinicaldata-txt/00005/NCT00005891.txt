TITLE:
Study of Allogeneic Bone Marrow Transplantation Following Cyclophosphamide and Radiotherapy in Patients With Fanconi's Anemia

CONDITION:
Fanconi's Anemia

INTERVENTION:
cyclophosphamide

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the effectiveness of moderate dose cyclophosphamide and total lymphoid
      radiotherapy in terms of improving the survival and reducing the morbidity following
      allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in patients with Fanconi's aplastic anemia.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on day -6 through -3 and
      total lymphoid radiotherapy on day -1. Patients undergo allogeneic bone marrow
      transplantation on day 0.

      Patients are followed for at least 100 days.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: N/A to 54 Years
Criteria:

        -  Diagnosis of severe aplastic anemia with the typical phenotype of Fanconi's anemia:
             Short stature Hypoplastic radii Skin pigmentation Renal anomalies Chromosomal
             fragility

          -  Family history of Fanconi's anemia

          -  Histocompatible related donor No evidence of excessive in vitro chromosome fragility
             typical of Fanconi's anemia Normal CBC and bone marrow
