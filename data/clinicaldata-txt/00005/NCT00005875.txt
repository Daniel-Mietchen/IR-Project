TITLE:
Nitrocamptothecin in Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma

CONDITION:
Melanoma (Skin)

INTERVENTION:
rubitecan

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of nitrocamptothecin in treating patients
      who have metastatic melanoma.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the efficacy and toxicity of nitrocamptothecin in patients with
      metastatic melanoma.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease (choroidal vs nonchoroidal). Patients
      receive oral nitrocamptothecin daily on days 1-5. Treatment continues weekly for at least 8
      weeks (2 courses) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28-74 patients (14-37 per stratum) will be accrued for this
      study.
