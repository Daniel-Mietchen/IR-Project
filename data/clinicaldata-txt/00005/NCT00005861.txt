TITLE:
Liposomal Doxorubicin in Treating Patients With Advanced or Recurrent Endometrial Cancer

CONDITION:
Endometrial Cancer

INTERVENTION:
pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of liposomal doxorubicin in treating
      women who have recurrent, stage III, or stage IV endometrial cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the antitumor activity and safety of doxorubicin HCl liposome in patients
           with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer.

        -  Determine the response rate, response duration, and overall survival of these patients
           treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome IV over 1 hour. Courses repeat every 4
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-51 patients will be accrued for this study.
