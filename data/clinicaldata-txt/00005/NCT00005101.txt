TITLE:
Study of Low Bone Mass in Premenopausal or Perimenopausal Women

CONDITION:
Osteoporosis

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the possible causes of bone loss in premenopausal or perimenopausal women.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients undergo physical examination and complete history with emphasis
      on risk factors for osteoporosis and screening for occult secondary causes of osteoporosis
      through blood serum and 24 hour urine collection.

      Patients with more than 6 months since prior bone mineral density measurements or who did
      not receive measurements at participating center, undergo dual energy x-ray absorptiometry
      over 30 minutes for bone mineral density measurements.
