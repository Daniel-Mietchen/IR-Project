TITLE:
Leuvectin in Treating Patients With Locally Recurrent Prostate Cancer

CONDITION:
Prostate Cancer

INTERVENTION:
Leuvectin

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Inserting the gene for interleukin-2 into a person's prostate cancer cells may
      make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of Leuvectin in treating patients who
      have locally recurrent prostate cancer after receiving treatment with radiation therapy.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxicity and tolerability of Leuvectin in patients with locally
      recurrent organ-confined prostate cancer after radiotherapy. II. Determine the efficacy of
      this regimen in preventing or delaying manifestations of disease progression as demonstrated
      by biochemical failure or clinical recurrence in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients receive Leuvectin
      intraprostatically over 10-30 seconds under transrectal ultrasound guidance on days 0 and
      14. Patients are re-evaluated at week 10. Treatment repeats every 10-11 weeks or 1-6 days
      after completion of each week 10 re-evaluation for a maximum of 3 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1
      year and then every 6 months for 2 years in the absence of disease progression.

      ACTUAL ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients were accrued for this study.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: Male
Age: 18 Years to N/A
Criteria:

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically proven locally recurrent organ-confined prostate
        cancer after external beam radiotherapy, radiation seed implants, or cryosurgery. Gleason
        score of at least 6. Prostate specific antigen values (PSA) of at least 1.0 ng/mL with 2
        consecutive rises in PSA at least 2 weeks apart, of which the second increase is greater
        than the first, after achieving a nadir. Must have at least 3 recorded PSA values over a
        minimum of the last 3 months to determine the slope. Patients must have declined
        additional conventional treatment or be ineligible for conventional treatment of their
        prostate cancer. No metastasis by bone scan. No significant central nervous system (CNS)
        disease.

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: 18 and over. Performance status: Karnofsky 80-100% OR
        Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 0 or 1. Life expectancy: Not specified.
        Hematopoietic: White blood cell count (WBC) greater than 3,000/mm3. Platelet count greater
        than 100,000/mm3. Hemoglobin greater than 9.0 g/dL. Hepatic: Bilirubin normal. Serum
        glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) or serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT)
        less than 3 times upper limit of normal. Albumin greater than 3 g/dL. Prothrombin time
        (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) normal. Hepatitis B surface antigen negative.
        Renal: Creatinine normal. Cardiovascular: No uncontrolled hypertension. No significant
        cardiovascular disease, e.g.: History of ventricular dysfunction; Congestive heart
        failure; Symptoms of coronary artery disease; History of any ventricular arrhythmia; Prior
        myocardial infarction. Other: HIV negative. Fertile patients must use effective
        double-barrier contraception during and for 3 months after study participation. No active
        autoimmune disease. No active infection requiring IV antibiotics. No uncontrolled diabetes
        mellitus. No significant psychiatric disorder that would preclude study. No other
        malignancy within the past 5 years except adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell
        skin cancer.

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: No prior Leuvectin. Chemotherapy: At least 3
        weeks since prior chemotherapy (6 weeks for mitomycin or hydroxyurea). Endocrine therapy:
        No prior hormonal therapy for prostate cancer. Radiotherapy: See Disease Characteristics.
        At least 3 weeks since prior radiotherapy. Surgery: At least 1 month since prior
        intrathoracic or intra-abdominal surgery. At least 2 weeks since other prior major
        surgery. Other: At least 10 days since prior anticoagulants or non-steroidal
        anti-inflammatory agents. No neoadjuvant or other concurrent anticancer drug therapy. No
        concurrent immunosuppressive drugs. No other concurrent experimental therapy.
