TITLE:
Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer

CONDITION:
Lung Cancer

INTERVENTION:
paclitaxel

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of paclitaxel in treating patients who
      have extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the complete and overall response rate to paclitaxel in patients
      with previously untreated extensive stage small cell lung cancer. II. Determine the overall
      and progression free survival of these patients in response to this treatment regimen. III.
      Determine the toxicity of this treatment regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours weekly for
      6 consecutive weeks. Treatment continues every 8 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 2 months for 1
      year, then every 3 months for 2 years, and then annually for 2 years.
