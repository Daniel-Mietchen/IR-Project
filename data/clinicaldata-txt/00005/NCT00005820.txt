TITLE:
Nitrocamptothecin in Treating Patients With Stage IV Prostate Cancer That Has Not Responded to Hormone Therapy

CONDITION:
Prostate Cancer

INTERVENTION:
nitrocamptothecin

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of nitrocamptothecin in treating men who
      have stage IV prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the therapeutic efficacy of nitrocamptothecin in patients with metastatic,
           hormone refractory prostate cancer.

        -  Determine time to disease progression and duration of response in this patient
           population as a result of this treatment regimen.

        -  Determine the safety, tolerance, and toxicity of this treatment regimen in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive nitrocamptothecin orally daily for 5 consecutive days each week
      for 3 consecutive weeks. Treatment continues every 4 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months until evidence of progression or relapse for a maximum
      of 2 years from the date of registration.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-46 patients will be accrued for this study over 2 years.
