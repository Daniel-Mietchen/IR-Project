TITLE:
Dynamic Aspects of Amino Acid Metabolism

CONDITION:
Kidney Diseases

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      This protocol seeks to define aspects of intestinal and hepatic uptake and metabolism of
      several amino acids. The major hypothesis to be tested is that the splanchic bed (intestine
      and liver) conserves essential amino acids and metabolites while synthesizing and
      metabolizing nonessential amino acids. The aims of the study include defining the relative
      roles of enteral and hepatic extraction/metabolism in the disposition of glutamate, alanine,
      methionine and other amino acids. Emphasis will also be placed on studies of the
      transamination of alpha-ketoisocaproic acid (KIC) to leucine since this reaction is of
      potential importance in the design of nutritional regimens for patients with renal disease.
