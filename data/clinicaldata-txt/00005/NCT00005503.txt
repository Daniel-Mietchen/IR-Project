TITLE:
Epidemiology of Cardiac Development in Youth

CONDITION:
Cardiovascular Diseases

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      To document normal developmental changes in cardiac structure and function during late
      childhood and adolescence.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The investigators documented the nature and extent of changes in cardiac structure based on
      M-mode measurements and developed corresponding reference values. They documented the nature
      and extent of changes in cardiac function based on pulse Doppler measures and indices and
      developed corresponding reference values. They also investigated clinical findings based on
      M-mode and Doppler measurements as well as changes in body size and composition, sexual
      maturation, and other covariates. They used existing data from Project HeartBeat! 's 12
      four-monthly examinations over the age range from 8 to 17 years.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
