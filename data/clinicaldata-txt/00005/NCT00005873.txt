TITLE:
Nitrocamptothecin in Treating Patients With Locally Recurrent or Metastatic Breast Cancer

CONDITION:
Breast Cancer

INTERVENTION:
rubitecan

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of nitrocamptothecin in treating patients
      who have locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the toxicity and efficacy of nitrocamptothecin in patients with
      locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. II. Determine the duration of response and
      time to treatment failure in these patients with this treatment regimen. III. Correlate
      serum levels of nitrocamptothecin and its lactone metabolite with response and toxicity in
      these patients. IV. Correlate topoisomerase I and II levels with toxicity and response in
      these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral nitrocamptothecin daily on days 1-5. Treatment continues
      weekly for 8 weeks. Patients achieving complete or partial response or stable disease
      continue therapy in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-43 patients will be accrued for this study within 8-18
      months.
