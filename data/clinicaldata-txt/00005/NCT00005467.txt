TITLE:
Indices of Severity and Prognosis for Sickle Cell Disease

CONDITION:
Anemia, Sickle Cell

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      To develop a clinical severity index that could prospectively identify sickle cell disease
      patients who were at high risk for a turbulent clinical course and a poor prognosis.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Using the database, univariate analysis showed that factors associated with the occurrence
      of cerebrovascular accident (51 patients) included hematocrit, rate of change of pocked red
      cell count, and polymer fraction at 40 percent oxygen saturation (PF40). Only low hematocrit
      was predictive of death in the pediatric cohort. There were 45 disease-related deaths.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
