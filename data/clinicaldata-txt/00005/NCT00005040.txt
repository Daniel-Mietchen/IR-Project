TITLE:
Arsenic Trioxide in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Non- Hodgkin's Lymphoma

CONDITION:
Lymphoma

INTERVENTION:
arsenic trioxide

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of arsenic trioxide in treating patients
      who have relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the complete and partial response rates, duration of complete
      response, freedom from progression, event free survival, and overall survival in patients
      with relapsed or refractory intermediate or high grade lymphoma treated with arsenic
      trioxide. II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 2-4 hours for a maximum of 25 cumulative
      days followed by a rest period of 3-4 weeks. Patients with complete or partial response may
      receive 6 additional courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients with minor response (25-50% tumor regression) may also receive further courses of
      treatment. Patients are followed at 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-41 patients will be accrued for this study.

Criteria:

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically proven non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) that has
        relapsed following or is resistant to at least 1 standard anticancer therapy or for which
        no curative therapy exists Intermediate or high grade NHL of one of the following types:
        Transformed low grade Diffuse small cleaved cell Diffuse large cell (including diffuse
        mixed cell and immunoblastic large cell) Primary mediastinal B-cell Follicular large cell
        (follicular center cell or grade III follicular cell) Anaplastic large cell Angiocentric
        (including nasal T-cell and pulmonary B-cell) Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma
        Peripheral T-cell Intestinal T-cell Intravascular lymphomatosis Lymphoblastic Diffuse
        small noncleaved cell/Burkitt's Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma Mantle cell Measurable
        disease A new classification scheme for adult non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by
        PDQ. The terminology of "indolent" or "aggressive" lymphoma will replace the former
        terminology of "low", "intermediate", or "high" grade lymphoma. However, this protocol
        uses the former terminology.
