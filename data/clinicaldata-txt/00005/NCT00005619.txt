TITLE:
Analysis of Blood and Bone Marrow to Detect Residual Disease in Patients With Previously Treated Hairy Cell Leukemia

CONDITION:
Leukemia

INTERVENTION:
polymerase chain reaction

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures that detect residual disease may predict disease relapse in
      patients who have hairy cell leukemia.

      PURPOSE: Diagnostic trial to determine the effectiveness of analyzing blood and bone marrow
      to detect residual disease in patients who have previously treated hairy cell leukemia.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the sensitivity of flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and
      polymerase chain reaction in detecting minimal residual disease following therapy with
      cladribine in patients with hairy cell leukemia.

      OUTLINE: Blood and bone marrow samples are obtained from patients at time of bone marrow
      biopsies to assess minimal residual disease using flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and
      polymerase chain reaction. Patients are followed for 2 years or until disease relapse.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15 patients will be accrued for this study over 12-24 months.
