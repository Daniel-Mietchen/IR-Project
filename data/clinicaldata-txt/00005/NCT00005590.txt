TITLE:
Levofloxacin to Prevent Infection Following Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Solid Tumors or Lymphoma

CONDITION:
Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors

INTERVENTION:
levofloxacin

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Giving antibiotics may be effective in preventing or controlling early infection
      in patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumors or lymphoma. It is not yet known if
      levofloxacin if effective in preventing infection.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of levofloxacin in
      preventing infection in patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumors or lymphoma.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine whether prophylactic treatment with levofloxacin reduces the rate of clinical
           infection in patients receiving myelosuppressive antineoplastic chemotherapy for solid
           tumors or lymphoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to age (under 40 vs 40-59 vs 60 and over), type of cancer (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
      vs Hodgkin's lymphoma vs breast vs germ cell vs small cell lung cancer vs other), and
      participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral levofloxacin once daily for 7 consecutive days during the
           expected neutrophil nadir of each chemotherapy course.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive an oral placebo once daily for 7 consecutive days as in arm I.

      Treatment in both arms continues for up to 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable side
      effects or allergy or a clear continuing indication for the prophylactic use of
      antibacterial agents during subsequent courses.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,500 patients (750 per arm) will be accrued for this study
      within 3 years.
