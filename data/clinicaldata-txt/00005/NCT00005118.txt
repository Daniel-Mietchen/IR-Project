TITLE:
The Safety and Effectiveness of Indinavir Plus Ritonavir Plus Two NRTIs in HIV-Infected Patients Who Need Early Intervention Treatment

CONDITION:
HIV Infections

INTERVENTION:
Indinavir sulfate

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to give indinavir plus
      ritonavir plus 2 NRTIs to HIV-infected patients who need early intervention treatment.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Patients receive indinavir bid plus ritonavir bid, plus 2 NRTIs bid (2 new NRTIs or 1 new
      NRTI and 1 NRTI without evidence of resistance). CD4 cell counts and plasma viral RNA are
      measured every 4 weeks for the duration of the study. Physical examination and laboratory
      tests of blood and urine are performed every 4 weeks for the duration of the study. Chest
      x-ray and 12-lead ECG are done prestudy.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 18 Years to N/A
Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria

        Patients may be eligible for this study if they:

          -  Are HIV-positive.

          -  Are 18 years of age or older.

          -  Have a CD4 cell count of at least 50 cells/mm3.

          -  Have a viral load (level of HIV in the blood) of at least 400 copies/ml but no more
             than 20,000 copies/ml.

          -  Have had an initial response to protease inhibitor therapy with a viral load of less
             than 400 copies/ml in two consecutive tests at least 1 week apart.

          -  Have been on anti-HIV (antiretroviral) treatment including indinavir or nelfinavir
             for at least 16 weeks.

          -  Have had virologic failure (two consecutive viral loads that were greater than or
             equal to 400 copies/ml and less than or equal to 20,000 copies/ml at least 1 week
             apart) that is not due to another infection, vaccination, or a temporary stop in
             treatment.

          -  Are naive to at least one of the selected NRTIs.
