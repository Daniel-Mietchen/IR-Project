TITLE:
Altered Calcium and Vitamin D in PMDD or Severe PMS

CONDITION:
Premenstrual Syndrome

INTERVENTION:
Measures of calcium and bone turnover

SUMMARY:

      Osteoporosis has become one of the most widely recognized disorders of our times affecting
      an estimated 25 million women in this country. Recent evidence has suggested that
      premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is associated with a calcium deficiency state and bone loss.
      This may place premenopausal women at greater risk for osteoporosis. An entity such as PMS
      may be an important physiological marker of a calcium disturbance. The purpose of this
      investigation is to understand more completely the extent to which calcium balance is
      disturbed in severe PMS or Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) by utilizing new tools to
      assess calcium and bone turnover. The long term objective is to elucidate the
      pathophysiology of PMDD or severe PMS as it relates to calcium hormones and bone markers.
      The experimental design involves the comparison between women witn severe PMS and
      asymptomatic controls.
