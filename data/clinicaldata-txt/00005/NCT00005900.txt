TITLE:
Study of Pulmonary Complications in Pediatric Patients With Storage Disorders Undergoing Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation

CONDITION:
I Cell Disease

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and serum obtained from pediatric
      patients with storage disorders prior to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
      (HSCT) for the presence of proinflammatory cytokines and for the production of nitric oxide
      by alveolar macrophages to identify possible risk factors for pulmonary complications.

      II. Investigate the underlying mechanism for the development of significant pulmonary
      complications in these patients during HSCT.

      III. Evaluate bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and serum obtained from these same patients at
      the time a pulmonary complication develops post-HSCT, or at 60 days post-HSCT if there has
      been no pulmonary complications.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) prior to allogeneic
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). ELISA assays for cytokines are performed.
      Patients are followed post-HSCT for the development of transplant related pulmonary
      complications. A repeat bronchoscopy with BAL is performed at the time pulmonary
      complications develop or at day 60 post-HSCT if no complications develop. Cytokine assays
      are repeated.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: N/A to N/A
Criteria:

        -  Diagnosis of an inborn error of metabolism eligible for allogeneic hematopoietic stem
             cell transplantation on protocol UMN-MT-1995-01
