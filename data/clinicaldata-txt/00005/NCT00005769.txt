TITLE:
Hormone Replacement Therapy and Insulin Action: A Double-Blind, Parallel, Placebo-Controlled Hormone Intervention Study in Postmenopausal Women

CONDITION:
Menopause

INTERVENTION:
Hormone Replacement Therapy

SUMMARY:

      Considerable controversy exists regarding the effect of estrogen and progesterone on insulin
      sensitivity in postmenopausal women. Thus, the goal is to examine the effect of estradiol
      and progestin on in vivo insulin sensitivity and pathways of intracellular glucose
      metabolism in postmenopausal women. This will be accomplished by examining the effects of
      unopposed estrogen (CEE) or combination estrogen and progestin (CEE/MPA) versus placebo
      therapy in 30 early menopausal women (defined from 6 months to 3 years post-cessation of
      menses). Women will be treated for 16 weeks and the outcome measures will be: 1) insulin
      sensitivity and glucose oxidation as determined by euglycemic clamp, 2) assessments of
      insulin sensitivity on muscle biopsy cultures with the primary endpoints being glucose
      uptake and glycogen accumulation/synthesis, 3) protein levels of insulin action cascade
      steps based on muscle biopsy Western blots.
