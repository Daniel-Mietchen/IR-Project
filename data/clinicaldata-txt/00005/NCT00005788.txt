TITLE:
Interleukin-2 in Treating Patients With Mycosis Fungoides or Sezary Syndrome

CONDITION:
Lymphoma

INTERVENTION:
aldesleukin

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill lymphoma cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of interleukin-2 in treating patients who
      have mycosis fungoides or Sezary syndrome.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with mycosis fungoides or Sezary syndrome
           treated with interleukin-2 (IL-2).

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive interleukin-2 subcutaneously for 4 consecutive days a week for 6
      consecutive weeks. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve complete response or stable disease continue
      treatment for 2 courses past best response. Patients who demonstrate a persistent partial
      response continue treatment in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-35 patients will be accrued for this study.
