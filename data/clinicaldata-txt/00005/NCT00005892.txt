TITLE:
Study of Allogeneic Bone Marrow Transplantation Following Cyclophosphamide and Radiotherapy in Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome and Acute Leukemia Related to Fanconi's Anemia

CONDITION:
Fanconi's Anemia

INTERVENTION:
cyclophosphamide

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the effectiveness of moderate dose cyclophosphamide and radiotherapy in terms
      of improving survival and reducing the morbidity following allogeneic bone marrow
      transplantation in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and acute leukemia related to
      Fanconi's anemia.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours on day -6 through -3 and total body
      radiotherapy on day -1. Patients undergo allogeneic bone marrow transplantation on day 0.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: N/A to 54 Years
Criteria:

        -  Diagnosis of Fanconi's anemia with the family history and typical phenotype
             including: Short stature Hypoplastic radii Skin pigmentation Renal anomalies
             Chromosomal fragility

          -  Evidence of Fanconi's myelodysplastic syndrome Bone marrow dysplasia of all 3 marrow
             cell lines AND Clonal cytogenetic abnormalities demonstrable in marrow cells

          -  First complete remission following therapy for Fanconi's acute leukemia allowed

          -  Must have related histocompatible donor No evidence of excessive in vitro chromosome
             fragility typical of Fanconi's anemia Normal CBC and bone marrow
