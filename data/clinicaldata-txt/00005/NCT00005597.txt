TITLE:
S9926 Temozolomide in Patients With Unresectable/Metastatic Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors

CONDITION:
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor

INTERVENTION:
temozolomide

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of temozolomide in treating patients who
      have unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the complete and partial response (confirmed and unconfirmed) in patients
           with unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors treated with
           temozolomide.

        -  Determine the qualitative or quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a
      confirmed complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses after a confirmed CR.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 13-27
      months.
