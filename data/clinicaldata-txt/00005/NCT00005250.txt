TITLE:
Linkage Study of Long QT Syndrome In An Amish Kindred

CONDITION:
Heart Diseases

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      To screen by electrocardiography the entire population of 1,400 individuals in seven Amish
      Mennonite communities in order to perform genetic linkage studies of long QT syndrome
      (LQTS).
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      BACKGROUND:

      LQTS is a severe heart disorder leading to sudden death due to ventricular tachycardia or
      ventricular fibrillation. The syndrome segregated as a Mendelian recessive in the highly
      inbred population under study and resulted in the sudden death of several members of the
      population.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The entire population was screened to identify cases of LQTS. In addition, 29 obligate
      heterozygotes were studied by 24-hour Holter monitoring to determine whether these gene
      carriers had any subtle phenotypes. The data were subjected to complex segregation and
      linkage analysis to establish the mode of inheritance and penetrance of LQTS.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
