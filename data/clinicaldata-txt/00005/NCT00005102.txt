TITLE:
Immunologic Evaluation in Patients With DiGeorge Syndrome or Velocardiofacial Syndrome

CONDITION:
DiGeorge Syndrome

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the pattern of immunologic reconstitution in patients with T-cell compromise
      due to DiGeorge syndrome or velocardiofacial syndrome.

      II. Determine any correlation between immunologic function in these patients and chromosome
      22 deletion breakpoints.

      III. Determine presence of sustained immunologic compromise in older patients.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      Blood samples are collected at diagnosis of chromosome 22q11 deletion and assessed for
      lymphocyte proliferation in response to mitogens phytohemagglutinin, pokeweed mitogen, and
      concanavalin A (mitogen stimulation analyses). These analyses are repeated at 4 months along
      with a quantitative analysis of immunoglobulin.

      At 8 months, patients are tested for their lymphocytes' ability to respond to antigens
      (candida, tetanus, and diphtheria). At 1 year, patients have lymphocyte subset, IgG, IgA,
      and IgM analyses performed. Quantitative evaluations of antibody titers to diphtheria,
      tetanus, Haemophilus influenza, and hepatitis B are also performed.

      Over 1 year of age, all studies are performed if the patient is seen for a single visit.
