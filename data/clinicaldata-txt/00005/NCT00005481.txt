TITLE:
Epidemiology of Impaired Coagulant Balance in Diabetes

CONDITION:
Cardiovascular Diseases

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      To determine the nature, extent and molecular mechanisms responsible for impaired
      fibrinolysis in White, Black, Hispanic and American Indian populations with respect to the
      presence or absence of diabetes. The overall objective is to determine whether impairments
      of fibrinolysis underlie subclinical and clinical vascular disease in diabetes in specific
      populations with and without accelerated microvascular disease.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      BACKGROUND:

      The results of this project should clarify the extent to which results obtained in
      experimental animals pertain directly to diabetes in human subjects. The study will also
      assist in the interpretation of results from clinical studies and from platelet activation
      experiments.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
