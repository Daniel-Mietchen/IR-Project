TITLE:
Study of Chediak-Higashi Syndrome

CONDITION:
Chediak Higashi Syndrome

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized in its
      classical form by oculocutaneous albinism, a bleeding diathesis, recurrent infection due to
      abnormal neutrophil and natural killer cell function, and eventual progression to a
      lymphohistiocytic infiltration known as the accelerated phase . Death often occurs within
      the first decade as a result of infection or the development of the accelerated phase; bone
      marrow transplantation is curative except for the late occurrence of neurological
      deterioration. The basic defect is unknown, although it probably involves abnormal fusion or
      trafficking of intracellular vesicles. Patients with classical CHS have their disease due to
      mutations in the LYST gene, but mildly affected individuals have been reported whose genetic
      defect has not been defined. It is likely that these variants of CHS have abnormalities in
      proteins involved in the pathways responsible for vesicle fusion. Since the full clinical
      spectrum of CHS and its variants has not been characterized, and the underlying defects
      remain enigmatic, we plan to evaluate this group of patients clinically, biochemically, and
      molecularly, and perform cell biological studies on their fibroblasts, melanocytes, and
      transformed lymphoblasts. Routine admissions will be 5 days and may occur every two years,
      or required by changes in clinical symptomatology.

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 1 Month to N/A
Criteria:

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        All patients entering this study will have some degree of oculocutaneous albinism plus
        either a bleeding diathesis or a history of excessive infections in childhood. Objective
        evidence of a platelet storage pool deficiency (e.g., an abnormal secondary aggregation
        response or absent platelet dense bodies) or of a lysosomal fusion abnormality (e.g.,
        giant cytoplasmic granules in leucocytes) will not be required.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients will be excluded if they cannot travel to NIH due to their medical condition.

        Patients who are less than one month old will be excluded.
