TITLE:
PS-341 in Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer

CONDITION:
Kidney Cancer

INTERVENTION:
PS-341

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. It is not yet known which regimen of PS-341 is more effective
      in treating metastatic kidney cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to study the effectiveness of PS-341 in treating
      patients who have metastatic kidney cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the objective response rate in patients with metastatic renal cell cancer
           treated with bortezomib.

        -  Determine the time to tumor progression and 1-year survival of patients treated with
           this drug.

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds twice weekly on weeks 1 and 2.
           Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo core biopsy.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo core biopsy. Patients then receive bortezomib IV as in arm I.

      Patients undergo radiologic re-evaluation of measurable lesions. Patients with stable
      disease or a partial or complete response continue to receive bortezomib in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-41 patients will be accrued for this study within 9-14
      months.
