TITLE:
Combination Chemotherapy Before Surgery in Treating Children With Localized Neuroblastoma

CONDITION:
Neuroblastoma

INTERVENTION:
carboplatin

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Giving chemotherapy drugs before surgery may shrink the tumor
      so that it can be removed during surgery.

      PURPOSE: Phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy given
      before surgery in treating children who have localized neuroblastoma.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the outcome, in terms of local control, event-free survival, and overall
           survival, of children with localized unresectable neuroblastoma without MYCN
           amplification treated with carboplatin, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and
           vincristine followed by surgery.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive carboplatin IV over 1 hour and etoposide IV over 2 hours on days 1-3
      (courses 1 and 3). Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 (or orally
      on days 2 and 3), doxorubicin IV over 6 hours on days 4-5, and vincristine IV on days 1 and
      5 (courses 2 and 4). Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses. Patients then undergo
      surgical resection followed by 2 additional courses of chemotherapy.

      Patients are followed at months 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, and 60.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.
