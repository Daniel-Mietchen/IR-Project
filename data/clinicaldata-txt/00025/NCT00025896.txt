TITLE:
Safety and Efficacy of Recombinant Human Acid Alpha-Glucosidase in the Treatment of Classical Infantile Pompe Disease

CONDITION:
Pompe Disease

INTERVENTION:
recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase (rhGAA)

SUMMARY:

      Pompe disease is caused by a deficiency of a critical enzyme in the body called acid alpha
      glucosidase (GAA). Normally, GAA is used by the body's cells to break down glycogen (a
      stored form of sugar) within specialized structures called lysosomes. In infants with severe
      cases of Pompe disease (called Classical Infantile Pompe disease), an excessive amount of
      glycogen accumulates and is stored in various tissues, especially heart, skeletal muscle,
      and liver, which prevents their normal function. This study being conducted to evaluate the
      safety and effectiveness of recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase (rhGAA) as a potential
      enzyme replacement therapy for Pompe disease. Patients diagnosed with Classical Infantile
      Pompe disease who have a small, but inactive, amount of natural GAA enzyme present in their
      bodies (called Cross-Reacting Immunologic Material-Positive or "CRIM (+)" patients), will be
      studied.
