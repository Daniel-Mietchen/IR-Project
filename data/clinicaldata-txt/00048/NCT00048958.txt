TITLE:
Cytogenetic Studies in Acute Leukemia and Multiple Myeloma

CONDITION:
Acute Leukemia

INTERVENTION:
cytogenetic analysis

SUMMARY:

      Chromosomal analysis or the study of genetic differences in patients previously untreated
      with AML, ALL, MDS or MM may be helpful in the diagnosis and classification of disease. It
      may also improve the ability to predict the course of disease and the selection of therapy.
      Institutions must have either an Alliance-approved cytogeneticist or an agreement from an
      Alliance-approved main member cytogenetics laboratory to enroll a patient on CALGB 8461. The
      Alliance Approved Institutional Cytogeneticists list is posted on the Alliance for Clinical
      Trials in Oncology website.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
NONE

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All

Criteria:

        1. Patients from adjuncts are eligible if the Main Member Cytogenetics laboratory has
             agreed to process samples from that adjunct.

          2. Within one month of registration on CALGB 8461, register onto a CALGB treatment study
             for previously untreated AML, ALL, MDS, or MM patients.

          3. Simultaneously with registration on CALGB 8461, register patients within the
             continental United States onto CALGB 9665 (LTB).
