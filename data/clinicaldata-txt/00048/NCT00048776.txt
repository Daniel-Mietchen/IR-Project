TITLE:
Safety and Efficacy of Pletal (Cilostazol) for the Treatment of Juvenile Primary and Secondary Raynauds Phenomenon

CONDITION:
Raynaud's Disease

INTERVENTION:
Pletal

SUMMARY:

      Juvenile secondary Raynauds (ray-knows) Phenomenon is a disorder of the blood vessels in
      the fingers and sometimes can affect the toes, nose, or ears. Children with secondary
      Raynauds Phenomenon have an underlying condition such as systemic lupus, scleroderma, or
      mixed connective tissue disease. When children with secondary Raynauds are exposed to
      chilly or cold conditions from weather, cold temperatures, or even holding cold items from
      the refrigerator, their fingers may become cold, numb, hurt, and/or turn purple or white.
      The investigational drug, Pletal(cilostazol), which has been approved for other conditions,
      inhibits the ability of one type of blood cell, platelets, to form blood clots, and also
      widens narrowed blood vessels. It has been used in a variety of other conditions in which
      blood flow is decreased. This study will test the safety and effectiveness
      Pletal(cilostazol) to lessen the severity of the symptoms and decrease the number of
      secondary Raynauds episodes in juvenile patients.
