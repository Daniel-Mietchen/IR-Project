TITLE:
Alicaforsen (ISIS 2302) in Patients With Active Crohn's Disease

CONDITION:
Crohn's Disease

INTERVENTION:
Alicaforsen

SUMMARY:

      ISIS 2302 is an antisense oligonucleotide drug that reduces the production of a specific
      protein called intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1), a substance that plays a
      significant role in the increase of inflammation. People with Crohn's disease have been
      shown to over-produce ICAM-1 in their gut tissues. Alicaforsen works by blocking ICAM-1
      messenger RNA, the "instruction" molecule that is required for the production of ICAM-1
      protein. This trial will examine effects of alicaforsen delivered by 2-hour intravenous
      infusion over a four-week period, compared to a placebo. Patients may remain on stable
      background 5-ASA, antibiotic, or immunosuppressive drugs, and prednisone (or equivalent) at
      </= 30 mg per day.
