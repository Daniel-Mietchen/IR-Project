TITLE:
Phase III Study of BMS-188667 (CTLA4Ig) in Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis Who Are Currently Failing Anti-TNF Therapy or Who Have Failed Anti-TNF Therapy in the Past.

CONDITION:
Rheumatoid Arthritis

INTERVENTION:
Abatacept

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this clinical research study is to determine whether abatacept treatment on a
      background of Disease Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) will relieve the symptoms of
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in participants who are currently receiving anti-tumor necrosis
      factor (TNF) therapy for at least 3 months and are not responding or have taken anti-TNF
      therapy in the last 3 months and did not respond. The safety of treatment with abatacept
      will also be evaluated. This study also has a 4.5-year long-term extension beginning 6
      months after the start of the study.
