TITLE:
Genetic Trial to Study Diarrhea in Patients With Stage III Colon Cancer Who Are Receiving Chemotherapy

CONDITION:
Colorectal Cancer

INTERVENTION:
mutation analysis

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Genetic testing may help predict how patients will respond to chemotherapy drugs
      and may help doctors plan more effective treatment with fewer side effects.

      PURPOSE: Genetic study to determine how genes affect the severity of diarrhea in patients
      with stage III colon cancer who are receiving chemotherapy.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine whether the presence of a 7 allele at the UGT1A1 locus is associated with
           either grade 3-4 diarrhea or grade 4 neutropenia in patients with stage III colon
           cancer after treatment with irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin calcium.

        -  Determine whether polymorphisms in the TS enhancer and/or MTHFR gene are associated
           with grade 3-4 diarrhea in these patients after treatment with fluorouracil and
           leucovorin calcium.

        -  Determine whether polymorphisms in UGT1A1, TS, MTHFR, CYP3A4, or CYP3A5 are associated
           with either grade 3-4 diarrhea or grade 4 neutropenia in these patients after treatment
           with irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin calcium.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior therapy (irinotecan, fluorouracil, and
      leucovorin calcium vs fluorouracil and leucovorin calcium) and prior toxic effects (grade
      3-4 diarrhea vs grade 4 neutropenia vs grade 1 or lower diarrhea AND grade 2 or lower
      neutropenia).

      Patients undergo collection of blood specimens for polymerase chain reaction and restriction
      fragment length polymorphism analysis. Genotyping assays are performed to determine UGT1A1
      promoter genotyping, UGT1A1 coding polymorphisms, TS promoter polymorphisms, and MTHFR
      polymorphisms.
