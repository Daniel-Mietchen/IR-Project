TITLE:
Anti-Leukemic Dendritic Cell Activated Donor Lymphocytes

CONDITION:
Leukemia, Myelocytic, Acute

INTERVENTION:
Apheresis

SUMMARY:

      Objectives:

        1. Determine the toxicity of infusions of allogeneic donor lymphocytes activated by acute
           leukemia derived dendritic cells (DC/ADL) in relapsed patients after allo-stem cell
           transplants.

        2. Quantitate the alloreactivity of DC/ADL and circulating immune effector cells in
           patients after infusion.

        3. Assess efficacy of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia in
           Blastic Crisis (CML-BC) derived dendritic cells and activated lymphocytes in promoting
           and sustaining remission in patients with relapse after allo-BMT or stem cell
           transplant.
