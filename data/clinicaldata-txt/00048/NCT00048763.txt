TITLE:
Safety and Efficacy of Pletal(Cilostazol) for the Treatment of Juvenile Primary and Secondary Raynauds Phenomenon

CONDITION:
Raynaud's Disease

INTERVENTION:
Pletal

SUMMARY:

      Juvenile primary Raynauds (ray-knows) Phenomenon is a disorder of the blood vessels in the
      fingers and sometimes can affect the toes, nose, or ears. When children with primary
      Raynauds Phenomenon are exposed to chilly or cold conditions from weather, cold
      temperatures, or even holding cold items from the refrigerator, their fingers may become
      cold, numb, hurt, and/or turn purple or white. Children with primary Raynauds Phenomenon
      have no underlying systemic disease. The cause for their symptoms is unknown. The
      investigational drug, Pletal(cilostazol), which has been approved for other conditions,
      inhibits the ability of one type of blood cell, platelets, to form blood clots, and also
      widens narrowed blood vessels. It has been used in a variety of other conditions in which
      blood flow is decreased. This study will test the safety and effectiveness
      Pletal(cilostazol) to lessen the severity of the symptoms and decrease the number of primary
      Raynauds episodes in juvenile patients.
