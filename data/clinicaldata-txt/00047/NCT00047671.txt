TITLE:
Ethnic Variations in Antidepressant Response

CONDITION:
Depression

INTERVENTION:
Citalopram

SUMMARY:

      This 11-week study aims to determine how genetic factors affect the way African Americans
      and Caucasians with major depression respond to antidepressant medication [citalopram
      (Celexa)].
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Depressed patients vary substantially in their responses to antidepressants. Genetic factors
      may account for a large part of these differences in response. This study will include both
      African Americans and Caucasians to examine the role of genetic factors in treatment
      response.

      Participants receive citalopram (Celexa) for 8 weeks and a placebo for 1 week. Visits occur
      once a week for 11 weeks. A variety of interviews, scales, tests, and questionnaires are
      used to assess participants.
