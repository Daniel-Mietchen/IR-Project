TITLE:
Tipifarnib in Treating Patients With Recurrent Bladder Cancer

CONDITION:
Bladder Cancer

INTERVENTION:
tipifarnib

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Tipifarnib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary
      for tumor cell growth.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of tipifarnib in treating patients who
      have recurrent bladder cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the 1-year recurrence-free survival rate of patients with stage 0 or I
           recurrent transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder treated with tipifarnib.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 37 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
