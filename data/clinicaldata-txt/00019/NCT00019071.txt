TITLE:
Chemotherapy Followed by Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Malignant Glioma

CONDITION:
Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors

INTERVENTION:
chemotherapy

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor
      cells. Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of cladribine followed by radiation
      therapy in treating patients who have malignant glioma.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of cladribine in combination with
      radiotherapy in patients with high grade glioma. II. Assess this regimen in terms of
      toxicity and survival in these patients. III. Assess the acute neurotoxicity of continuous
      infusion cladribine in these patients. IV. Assess this regimen in terms of response, local
      control, and time to progression in these patients. V. Define a dose level of cladribine
      associated with potentiation of acute and/or delayed radiation toxicity (radiosensitizing
      dose level).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of cladribine. Patients receive cladribine by
      continuous IV infusion 5 days a week for 4 weeks and undergo radiotherapy twice a day,
      beginning 3 hours after initiation of cladribine, 5 days a week for 4.5 weeks. Treatment
      continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6
      patients receive escalating doses of cladribine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 1 month, then every 3 months
      thereafter for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-42 patients will be accrued for this study within 18
      months.
