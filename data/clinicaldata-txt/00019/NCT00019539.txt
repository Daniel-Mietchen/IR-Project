TITLE:
Monoclonal Antibody Therapy in Treating Patients With Advanced Kidney Cancer

CONDITION:
Stage IV Renal Cell Cancer

INTERVENTION:
bevacizumab

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver
      tumor-killing substances to them.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to determine the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody
      therapy in treating patients who have advanced kidney cancer that cannot be surgically
      removed.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effect of monoclonal antibody VEGF on time to progression,
      angiogenesis, and overall survival in patients with unresectable advanced renal cell cancer.

      II. Evaluate serum antibody levels and biologically active vascular endothelial growth
      factor levels in the plasma of patients treated with this regimen.

      III. Evaluate the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified by prior interleukin-2
      therapy (yes vs no).

      Patients are randomized to receive either placebo or one of two doses of monoclonal antibody
      VEGF. Following an initial loading dose, patients receive one dose of the study drug
      intravenously every 2 weeks for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression.
      Patients who are given placebo and experience disease progression are offered monoclonal
      antibody VEGF and thalidomide if there are no contraindications.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL:

      A total of 150 patients will be accrued for this study over 2 years.
