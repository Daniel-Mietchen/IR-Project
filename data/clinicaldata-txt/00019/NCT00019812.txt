TITLE:
Monoclonal Antibody Plus Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer That Overexpresses HER2

CONDITION:
Breast Cancer

INTERVENTION:
trastuzumab

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can locate tumor cells and deliver
      tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy
      use different ways to make tumor cells stop dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining
      monoclonal antibody therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of trastuzumab plus paclitaxel in
      treating patients who have metastatic breast cancer that overexpresses HER2.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of trastuzumab (Herceptin) and
           paclitaxel in patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer.

        -  Provide access to trastuzumab and paclitaxel for these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 30-90 minutes and paclitaxel IV
      over 1 hour weekly. Patients receive trastuzumab alone during course 1 and then in
      combination with paclitaxel during subsequent courses. Courses repeat every 4 weeks until
      patients achieve a sustained complete response of 8 weeks or disease progression occurs.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 55 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
