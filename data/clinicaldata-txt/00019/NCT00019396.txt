TITLE:
flt3L With or Without Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma or Renal Cell Cancer

CONDITION:
Stage IV Melanoma

INTERVENTION:
flt3 ligand

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: The drug flt3L may stimulate a person's immune system and help to kill tumor
      cells. Vaccines made from melanoma cells may make the body build an immune response to and
      kill their tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of flt3L with or without vaccine therapy
      in treating patients with metastatic melanoma or renal cell cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the immunologic and biologic activity of flt3 ligand (Flt3L) alone
      in patients with metastatic renal cell cancer or HLA-A2.1 negative melanoma.

      II. Evaluate the immunologic and biologic activity of Flt3L alone or in combination with
      melanoma peptide immunization (MART-1, gp100:209-217, gp100:280-288, and tyrosinase) in
      patients with metastatic, HLA-A2.1 positive melanoma.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups:

      Group 1 (renal cell cancer): Patients receive Flt3 ligand (Flt3L) subcutaneously (SQ) alone
      on days 1-14.

      Group 2 (HLA-A2.1 negative melanoma): Patients receive Flt3L SQ alone on days 1-14.

      Group 3 (HLA-A2.1 positive melanoma): Patients may receive either Flt3L SQ alone on days
      1-14 or in combination with melanoma peptide immunization. Patients may receive melanoma
      peptide immunization comprised of MART-1 immunodominant peptide, gp100:209-217,
      gp100:280-288, and tyrosinase peptide emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 SQ on day 12 of Flt3L
      administration.

      Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 2 courses. Patients with no response or minor response
      may receive 2 additional courses. Patients with disease progression after 1 course are
      removed from study.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL:

      Approximately 54-96 patients (18-32 per treatment group) will be accrued for this study
      within 16 months.
