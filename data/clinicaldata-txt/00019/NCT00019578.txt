TITLE:
Stereotactic Radiosurgery in Treating Patients With Brain Tumors

CONDITION:
Adult Central Nervous System Germ Cell Tumor

INTERVENTION:
Sterotactic radiosurgery

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I
      trial to study the effectiveness of stereotactic radiosurgery in treating patients who have
      brain tumors.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Establish stereotaxic radiosurgery as a treatment technique at the National
      Institute of Health in patients with intracranial neoplasms.

      II. Assess the response rate, local control, time to progression, pattern of failure, and
      magnetic resonance spectrographic data following this therapy in these patients.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: All patients undergo stereotaxic head frame placement, followed by
      stereotaxic radiosurgery on day 1. The dosage of radiation therapy administered is dependent
      on the tumor diameter.

      Patients are followed at 2 and 6 weeks and then every 3 months for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL:

      Up to 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 7-10 months.
