TITLE:
Flavopiridol in Treating Patients With Refractory Cancer

CONDITION:
Lymphoma

INTERVENTION:
alvocidib

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of flavopiridol in treating patients who
      have refractory cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of
      flavopiridol in patients with refractory solid tumors or lymphoma. 2. Determine the
      pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive flavopiridol IV over 1 hour on
      day 1. Treatment continues every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression. A cohort of
      3-6 patients receives treatment at each dose level of flavopiridol. If dose-limiting
      toxicity (DLT) occurs in no more than 1 of 6 patients, subsequent cohorts of 6 patients each
      receive escalating doses of drug on the same schedule. Intrapatient dose escalation to the
      next level is permitted in the absence of DLT.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 36 patients will be accrued for this study within 27
      months.
