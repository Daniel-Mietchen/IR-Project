TITLE:
Combined Use of Teriparatide and Raloxifene in Postmenopausal Women With Osteoporosis

CONDITION:
Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal

INTERVENTION:
teriparatide

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to compare treatment with both teriparatide and raloxifene with
      teriparatide alone. The study will evaluate any side effects that may be associated with the
      two drugs and may help to determine whether teriparatide and raloxifene together can help
      patients with osteoporosis more than teriparatide alone.
