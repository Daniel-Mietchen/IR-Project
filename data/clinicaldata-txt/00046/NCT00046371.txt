TITLE:
Safety and Immunological Response Rate Study of THERATOPE Vaccine in Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients

CONDITION:
Breast Neoplasms

INTERVENTION:
THERATOPE vaccine

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to examine the immunological response rate to administration of
      the THERATOPE vaccine in women with stable metastatic breast cancer who are being treated
      with aromatase inhibitors or Faslodex and who do not require chemotherapy.

      Post-menopausal women on aromatase inhibitors or Faslodex alone and pre-menopausal women on
      aromatase inhibitors plus luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LH/RH)-agonist may be
      eligible to be enrolled.

      Patients must not have had radiotherapy or major surgery within four (4) weeks prior to
      entering the study.

      Information about the safety and tolerability of administration of the THERATOPE vaccine
      will also be gathered during the course of the study.
