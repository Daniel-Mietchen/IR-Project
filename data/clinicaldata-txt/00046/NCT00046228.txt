TITLE:
A Study of Abciximab and Reteplase When Administered Prior to Catherization After a Myocardial Infarction (Finesse)

CONDITION:
Myocardial Infarction

INTERVENTION:
abciximab placebo; reteplase placebo, abciximab, abciximab

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether abciximab given in combination with
      reteplase, before patients have a coronary intervention (a standard treatment where a
      catheter is inserted into the heart artery to get blood flowing past the clot), is safe and
      effective in the treatment of heart attacks compared to only abciximab given during coronary
      intervention.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      The purpose of this medical research study is to determine whether abciximab given in
      combination with reteplase, before patients have a coronary intervention (a standard
      treatment where a catheter is inserted into the heart artery to get blood flowing past the
      clot), is safe and effective in the treatment of heart attacks compared to only abciximab
      given during coronary intervention. This medical research study will also help determine if
      the combination of abciximab and reduced dose reteplase will decrease the risk of death, and
      reduce complications of a heart attack at 90 days compared to abciximab alone which is a
      standard treatment.

      Patients will receive either abciximab and reteplease or abciximab alone. Safety evaluations
      will be performed at specified intervals throughout the study and will consist of laboratory
      tests, vital signs (such as blood pressure), physical examinations and the occurrence and
      severity of adverse events as well as other study specific procedures. Patients will receive
      either abciximab and reteplease or abciximab and placebo into a vein in their arm for up to
      12 hours.
