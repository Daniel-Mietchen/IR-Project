TITLE:
Nicotine Patch for Nicotine Dependence in Individuals With Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder - 1

CONDITION:
Tobacco Use Disorder

INTERVENTION:
Nicotine patch

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to test the use of High-Dose versus Regular-Dose Nicotine Patch
      for Nicotine Dependence in Individuals with Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      This is a randomized double-blind placebo controlled 8 week outpatient medication clinical
      trial to evaluate the relative efficacy of High-Dose (42mg) versus Regular Dose (21mg)
      nicotine patch treatment for individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and
      nicotine dependence. It also has a placebo controlled continuation phase to examine if
      longer duration of treatment is more effective than a standard eight week dosing schedule.
      The literature supports that schizophrenics have an increased rates of smoking and are more
      likely to be dependent on nicotine. Nicotine gum and patches are safe and now approved for
      over the counter sale in the United States. High dose patch therapy is well tolerated and
      provides more complete nicotine replacement. This improves withdrawal symptom relief and it
      is hypothesized that abstinence rates from smoking will be greater in the high dose patch
      group. Few trials have examined the usefulness of nicotine replacement therapy in this
      population and preliminary evidence shows lower than expected success rates of smoking
      cessation with conventional treatments
