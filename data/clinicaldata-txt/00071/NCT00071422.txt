TITLE:
Safety and Efficacy of INGAP-Peptide in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes

CONDITION:
Diabetes Mellitus, Non-Insulin-Dependent

INTERVENTION:
INGAP-Peptide

SUMMARY:

      Insulin is a chemical that the body needs in order to use or store sugar. It is made by a
      type of cell called a beta cell which resides in an organ known as the pancreas. Type 2
      diabetes is a disease where the beta cells are unable to meet a person's insulin needs.
      Sugar levels rise in the blood as a result. INGAP-Peptide is being tested to attempt to
      create new beta cells in the pancreas, and to improve the ability to produce insulin in type
      2 diabetic patients.
