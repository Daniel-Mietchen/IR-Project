TITLE:
Safety and Efficacy of INGAP-Peptide in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes

CONDITION:
Diabetes Mellitus, Insulin-Dependent

INTERVENTION:
INGAP-Peptide

SUMMARY:

      Insulin is a chemical that the body needs in order to use or store sugar. It is made by a
      type of cell called a beta cell which resides in an organ known as the pancreas. Type 1
      diabetes is a disease where the beta cells have been destroyed so that little or no insulin
      is made. Sugar levels rise in the blood as a result. INGAP-Peptide is being tested to
      attempt to create new beta cells in the pancreas, and to restore the ability to produce
      insulin in type 1 diabetic patients.
