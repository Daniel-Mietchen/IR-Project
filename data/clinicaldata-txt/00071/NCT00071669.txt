TITLE:
Acupuncture as a Supplemental Treatment for Bipolar Depression

CONDITION:
Bipolar Disorder

Acupuncture

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment
      of Bipolar Depression.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Patients receive 8 weeks (12 sessions) of acupuncture treatment plus stable medication.
      Patients are randomly assigned to receive either acupuncture designed to relieve symptoms of
      depression or acupuncture designed to relieve some other legitimate physical condition. A
      comparison group of patients who take medication but do not receive acupuncture is assessed
      to evaluate the effectiveness of medication alone. Patients participate in clinical
      assessment each week, which includes visiting with a psychiatrist and completing symptom
      rating scales.
