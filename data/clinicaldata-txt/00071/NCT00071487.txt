TITLE:
Safety and Efficacy Study of LymphoStat-B (Belimumab) in Subjects With Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)

CONDITION:
Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic

INTERVENTION:
Placebo

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 3 different doses of
      belimumab, administered in addition to standard therapy, in patients with active SLE
      disease.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of three different doses of
      belimumab (1 mg/kg, 4 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg), administered in addition to standard therapy,
      compared to placebo plus standard therapy in patients with active SLE disease. Patients were
      randomly assigned, following stratification by the screening SELENA SLEDAI score (4 to 7
      versus  8), to 1 of the 4 study arms (3 active arms and 1 placebo arm plus standard therapy
      for SLE). All patients were to be dosed on Days 0, 14, and 28, then every 28 days for the
      remainder of 52 weeks. Patients completing the 52-week period could enter a 24-week
      open-label extension; belimumab patients received the same dose or were switched to 10 mg/kg
      at the investigator's discretion and former placebo patients received belimumab 10 mg/kg.
