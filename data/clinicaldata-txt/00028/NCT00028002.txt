TITLE:
Neoadjuvant and Adjuvant Imatinib Mesylate in Treating Patients With Primary or Recurrent Malignant Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor

CONDITION:
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor

INTERVENTION:
imatinib mesylate

SUMMARY:

      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of neoadjuvant and adjuvant imatinib mesylate in
      treating patients who are undergoing surgery for primary or recurrent malignant
      gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth. Giving imatinib mesylate before and after
      surgery may shrink the tumor so it can be removed and may kill any tumor cells remaining
      after surgery.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the progression-free survival of patients with primary or recurrent potentially
      resectable malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumor treated with neoadjuvant and adjuvant
      imatinib mesylate.

      II. Determine the objective response rate of patients treated with this drug. III. Determine
      the safety of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once daily. Treatment continues for 8 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression. Patients with disease progression are considered for
      immediate surgical resection. Otherwise, after 8 weeks, patients undergo surgical resection
      to debulk all gross tumor. Two to four weeks after surgery, patients receive oral imatinib
      mesylate once daily for 2 years.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.
