TITLE:
Clofarabine in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia

CONDITION:
Hematologic Neoplasms

INTERVENTION:
Clofarabine

SUMMARY:

      This is a dose-escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated dose and toxic effects of
      clofarabine in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and other acute leukemias.
      Clofarabine is a synthesized hybrid nucleoside analog, which is believed to possess the
      better qualities of fludarabine and chlorodeoxyadenosine, the 2 most active agents against
      lymphoproliferative disorders. Thus, it is hoped that this drug will be more active and less
      toxic than similar drugs.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      The first group of patients will be treated at the starting dose level of 2 mg/m2 over 1
      hour daily for 5 days. Dosage escalation will be permitted in individual patients if no
      toxicity occurred during the preceding course. Subsequent dose escalations will be by 50%
      until Grade 2 toxicity, then by 35% until the maximum tolerated dose.
