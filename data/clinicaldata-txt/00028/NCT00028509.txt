TITLE:
Brain Function in Children Previously Treated on Clinical Trials POG-9605 and POG-9201

CONDITION:
Long-term Effects Secondary to Cancer Therapy in Children

INTERVENTION:
management of therapy complications

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Assessing the effects of methotrexate on brain function in children may improve
      the ability to plan treatment and decrease side effects.

      PURPOSE: Clinical trial to compare brain function of children who have been previously
      treated with methotrexate.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the incidence of neuropsychological abnormalities and leukoencephalopathy in
           children previously treated with methotrexate on protocols POG-9605 versus POG-9201.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      More than 3 years after completion of therapy, patients undergo 9 different tests to assess
      intelligence, memory, learning, attention, concentration, processing of information,
      functioning, and visual-motor integration. Patients also undergo MRI of the head.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-54 patients previously treated on protocol POG-9201 will be
      accrued for this study. A total of 60-108 patients previously treated on protocol POG-9605
      will be accrued for this study.
