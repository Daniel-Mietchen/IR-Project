TITLE:
NMR Scanning on Patients

CONDITION:
Diagnostic Imaging

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      This protocol is designed to investigate the use of novel techniques in MRI that may not yet
      be commercially available. Specifically, the protocol enables patients to take advantage of
      new pulse sequence software, coil design or post processing capabilities not otherwise
      available. The informed consent explains MRI in lay terms, describes the use of contrast
      agents and lists contraindications to MRI.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      NMR imaging promises to provide useful and unique diagnostic information in a variety of
      diseases. In an attempt to evaluate its role, we plan to study a wide range of diseases
      during the initial year of imaging. Exposure to magnetic fields and radiofrequency energies
      of this magnitude have demonstrated no deleterious effects clinically or in the laboratory.
      The only restrictions will be those imposed by ferromagnetic objects within the patient
      which would increase the risk of placing them in a strong magnetic field.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: N/A to N/A
Criteria:

        Any patient undergoing MRI for research or clinical purposes who is participating in a
        currently active NIH protocol.

        No patients with pacemakers, cochlear implants, implanted pumps, shrapnel, metal in the
        globe of the eye, cerebral aneurysm clips or other contraindication to MRI.
