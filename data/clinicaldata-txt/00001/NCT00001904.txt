TITLE:
Assessment of a B-Mode Ultrasound Technique for the Measurement of Carotid Artery Intima-Media Thickness

CONDITION:
Atherosclerosis

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      This minimal risk protocol is designed to assess the reproducibility of B-mode ultrasound
      measurements of carotid intima media thickness (IMT) when the scans are performed in CC
      Radiology and read using a computerized edge reader. Up to 20 volunteers will have two
      ultrasounds performed within a 6-month period. IMT thickness is used as a surrogate marker
      for atherosclerosis and may be of value in clinical trials.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      This minimal risk protocol is designed to assess the reproducibility of B-mode ultrasound
      measurements of carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) when the scans are performed in CC
      Radiology and read using a computerized edge reader. Up to 50 volunteers will have two
      ultrasounds performed within a 6-month period. IMT thickness is used as a surrogate marker
      for atherosclerosis and may be of value in clinical trials.
