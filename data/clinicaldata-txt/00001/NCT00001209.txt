TITLE:
A Pilot Study for the Treatment of Patients With Metastatic and High Risk Sarcomas and Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumors

CONDITION:
Neuroectodermal Tumor, Primitive

INTERVENTION:
vincristine, adriamycin and cytoxan, alternating with ifosfamide VP-16

SUMMARY:

      This protocol is designed to test the feasibility of the administration of vincristine,
      adriamycin and cytoxan, alternating with the newly developed regimen ifosfamide VP-16 as
      well as the efficacy of this therapy in addition to radiotherapy in producing complete
      responses and disease-free survival in patients with Ewing's sarcoma, primitive sarcoma of
      bone, peripheral neuroepithelioma, and soft tissue sarcoma. This will not be a randomized
      study but will be comparable to the large data base of similar patients treated on
      successive Pediatric Branch studies.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      This protocol is designed to test the feasibility of the administration of vincristine,
      adriamycin and cytoxan, alternating with the newly developed regimen ifosfamide VP-16 as
      well as the efficacy of this therapy in addition to radiotherapy in producing complete
      responses and disease-free survival in patients with Ewing's sarcoma, primitive sarcoma of
      bone, peripheral neuroepithelioma, and soft tissue sarcoma. This will not be a randomized
      study but will be comparable to the large data base of similar patients treated on
      successive Pediatric Branch studies.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: N/A to N/A
Criteria:

        Patients with high grade soft tissue sarcomas and either metastatic disease or stage III
        tumors including synovial sarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, hemangiopericytoma,
        malignant schwannoma (neurofibrosarcoma).

        Patients must not have been previously treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

        The patients age must be less than or equal to 25 years.

        The patient (or their guardian if under 18 years of age) must sign a document indicating
        that he/she is aware of the investigational nature of this treatment protocol and the
        potential risks and benefits that may be expected.

        Patients must have a direct bilirubin of less than 4.0 mg/dl.

        Patients must not have abnormal cardiac function (ejection fraction greater than 45% on
        MUGA scan with confirmation of shortening-fraction greater than 25% on echocardiography).
