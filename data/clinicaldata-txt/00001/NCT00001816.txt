TITLE:
The Impact of Starbright World on Children Being Treated at the NIH

CONDITION:
Child, Hospitalized

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      This study seeks to evaluate the impact of Starbright World (SBW) on hospitalized children.
      SBW is a virtual environment designed to link seriously ill children into an interactive
      online community where they can play games, learn about their condition, or talk with other
      ill children who are connected to the network. Our outcome evaluation of SBW will include
      assessments of pain, mood (anxious, depressed and energetic), anger, loneliness, and
      willingness to return to the NIH for treatment of children who are being treated at NIH.
      They will be assessed while engaging in "normal" recreational activities (in one of two
      available playrooms) and while using Starbright World. In addition, we will conduct a
      process evaluation of the implementation of Starbright World.
