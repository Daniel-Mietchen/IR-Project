TITLE:
Evaluation of the Genetics of Bipolar Disorder

CONDITION:
Mania

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      This study looks to identify genes that may affect a person's chances of developing bipolar
      disorder (BP) and related conditions.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Bipolar affective disorder is a severe, heritable condition affecting about one percent of

      the population. The mode of inheritance is poorly understood and probably involves multiple
      loci of small to moderate effect. In this project, we use genetic mapping and sequencing
      methods to identify genetic markers and variations that contribute to the risk of bipolar
      disorder. Individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder are studied, along with their
      relatives. Phenotypic information obtained from clinical interviews and family history is
      correlated with genotypic information obtained from genetic marker and sequencing methods.
      The goal is to identify genes involved in bipolar disorder and related conditions so that
      better methods of diagnosis, treatment, and prevention can be developed.
