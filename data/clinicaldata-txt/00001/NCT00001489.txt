TITLE:
Effect of Vigabatrin on Brain Blood Flow and Glucose Metabolism

CONDITION:
Epilepsy

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      This study is designed to test the effects of vigabatrin (gamma-vinyl-GABA) an experimental
      drug used for the treatment of epilepsy. The study will use positron emission tomography
      (PET scan) to detect areas of the brain receiving increased blood flow and using increased
      amounts of glucose. Increases in blood flow and glucose use are good indicators of brain
      activity.

      Researchers are interested in determining the effects of Vigabatrin on brain blood flow and
      glucose use.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      This double-blind placebo-controlled parallel design protocol will investigate the effects
      of gamma-vinyl-GABA (vigabatrin--GVG) an experimental antiepileptic drug, on cerebral
      glucose metabolism (LCMRglc), blood flow (CBF), and seizure frequency, in patients with
      uncontrolled complex partial (CPS) and secondary generalized seizures (GTCS). Positron
      Emission Tomography (PET) will be used to measure CBF and LCMRglc.
    

ELIGIBILITY:

Age: N/A to N/A
Criteria:

        Localization-related epilepsy.

        Uncontrolled seizures.

        Ability to tolerate tegretol monotherapy.

        No systemic illness requiring drug therapy.

        No illness that might be made worse by vigabatrin.
