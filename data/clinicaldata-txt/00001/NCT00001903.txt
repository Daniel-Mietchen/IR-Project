TITLE:
Prevention of RSV Infections in Bone Marrow Transplant Recipients

CONDITION:
Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection

INTERVENTION:
RSV Polyclonal Immunoglobulin

SUMMARY:

      Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infections are very common and widespread. By age 5,
      virtually everyone has been infected and developed antibodies against some strain of the
      virus. RSV infections happen during adulthood, leading to common cold syndromes. In Bone
      Marrow Transplant recipients the disease is much more severe, usually progressing to
      pneumonia. This phenomenon is associated with mortality rates around 60-80%.

      RSV Polyclonal Immunoglobulin (Respigam (Registered Trademark)) has been approved by the
      Food and Drug Administration and recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics for
      prophylaxis of RSV disease in premature babies and children born with bronchopulmonary
      dysplasia. Furthermore, it has been used to treat RSV pneumonia in children and Bone Marrow
      Transplant recipients with encouraging results and no complications.

      Currently, no preventive strategies are available when approaching this infection among bone
      marrow transplant patients. We intend to prevent our bone marrow transplant patients from
      developing RSV pneumonia by employing the strategy already used in premature babies, i.e.,
      by passive immunization with Respigam (Registered Trademark). Our goal to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of this strategy in such immunocompromised population.

      We believe that this will be a more reasonable approach than waiting for the infection to
      settle in and only then treating it, because optimal therapy is not currently available.

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: N/A to N/A
Criteria:

        Male or female patients who are between the ages of 2 and 80 years.

        Must be admitted to the Bone Marrow Transplant Unit for a bone marrow transplantation
        (BMT), peripheral stem cell transplantation (PSCT) or mini-transplantation (MT).

        Must be in the early phase of BMT, PSCT or MT, i.e., receiving conditioning therapy for
        the transplant or within the first 30 days of receiving a bone marrow graft or;

        Must be greater than 30 days post-engraftment but being treated for Graft vs. Host disease
        (GVHD) with a total dose of equal to or greater than 1.5 grams/m(2) of methylprednisolone
        (or equivalent dose of steroids) over the first 3 days.

        Must have a negative result (at 48 hours) for RSV in the screening respiratory viral
        culture.

        Less than 8 days have elapsed between meeting eligibility criteria, being contacted by one
        of the investigators, and making a decision to join the study.

        Patients with signs or symptoms of Upper Respiratory Tract infection or pneumonia will be
        excluded until the etiology is established or RSV is ruled-out by the screening culture.

        Patients will be excluded if they have any condition that, in the opinion of the
        investigator, could affect their safety, preclude evaluation of response, or render
        unlikely that the contemplated course of therapy can be completed.
