TITLE:
Vascular and Metabolic Effects of Hormone Therapy Combined With L-Arginine in Postmenopausal Women

CONDITION:
Hypercholesterolemia

INTERVENTION:
L-arginine

SUMMARY:

      Estrogen therapy has been associated with reduced risk of coronary heart disease events in
      observational studies of postmenopausal women. Although favorable effects of estrogen on
      lipoprotein cholesterol levels probably account for much of this benefit, direct vascular
      effects (vasomotor, hemostatic, anti-inflammatory) regulated by nitric oxide (NO) may also
      be of importance. We have recently shown that vasodilator effects of estrogen in the
      coronary circulation are due to enhanced bioactivity of NO released from the endothelium.
      Estrogen has been shown to stimulate synthesis and activity of the enzyme NO synthase with
      enhanced NO synthesis in endothelial cells in culture. Because L-arginine is the natural
      substrate for the enzyme NO synthase, we propose that the combination of L-arginine and
      estrogen might have additive vasomotor, hemostatic and anti-inflammatory effects in
      hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women.

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: Female
Age: N/A to N/A
Criteria:

        All volunteer subjects will be assessed for study participation, including a
        cardiovascular physical examination and resting electrocardiogram. Fasting blood will be
        taken for SMAC, CBC, thyroid battery, lipid levels, estradiol and FSH levels under
        screening protocol 94-H-0045. A urine pregnancy test will be performed in women with a
        uterus and cessation of menses less than 6 months. Aspirin and non-steroidal
        anti-inflammatory drugs and steroidal drugs (oral, ointment, drops or inhalation) will be
        stopped 10 days prior to starting the study and discontinued throughout the study.

        Thirty hypercholesterolemic (LDL greater than 130 mg/dL) postmenopausal women who have not
        taken estrogenic hormone, antioxidant vitamins (A, C, E), or lipid-lowering therapy in the
        preceding 2 months will be selected to take part in this double-blind, cross-over study.

        No subjects with plasma estradiol level greater than 50 pg/ml and FSH less than 50 pg/ml.

        No subjects with blood pressure greater than 160/100 mm/Hg (off medication).

        No subjects smoking cigarettes within 6 months.

        No pregnant subjects.

        No subjects with a history of deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolus.

        No subjects with important chronic medical conditions (cancer, coronary artery disease,
        diabetes mellitus, COPD, renal disease) other than hypothyroidism if the subject is
        euthyroid on thyroid replacement.

        No subjects who refuse to follow nitrate-restricted diet for 3 days prior to each study.
