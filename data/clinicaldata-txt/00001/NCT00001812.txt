TITLE:
A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo Controlled Trial Evaluating the Impact of Nystatin on the Development of Oral Irritation in Patients Receiving High Dose Intravenous Interleukin-2

CONDITION:
Candidiasis, Oral

INTERVENTION:
Nystatin

SUMMARY:

      In patients who are receiving intravenous high dose Interleukin-2, patients will be
      randomized into two groups: group one will receive nystatin swish and swallow immediately
      before initiation of IL-2, and the second group will receive a placebo. The patients in each
      group will be monitored and evaluated for differences in the rate and severity of
      development of oral irritation during treatment. They will also be studied for differences
      between the two groups in the number of doses of IL-2 taken.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      In patients who are receiving intravenous high dose Interleukin-2, patients will be
      randomized into two groups: group one will receive nystatin swish and swallow immediately
      before initiation of IL-2, and the second group will receive a placebo. The patients in each
      group will be monitored and evaluated for differences in the rate and severity of
      development of oral irritation during treatment. They will also be studied for differences
      between the two groups in the number of doses of IL-2 taken.
