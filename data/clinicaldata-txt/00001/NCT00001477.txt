TITLE:
Monitoring Patients for Developing Communicable and Opportunistic Infections and for Responding to Therapy

CONDITION:
Communicable Diseases

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      Patients are exposed to infectious agents regularly, regardless of their immunologic status.
      Traditionally clinicians have decided to institute prophylaxis based on epidemiologic
      factors, skin test (i.e. PPD), or immunologic parameters. A quantitative and specific method
      that is non-invasive, such as quantitative PCR, would be desirable to more precisely define
      those who would benefit from prophylaxis. Similarly, when patients develop disease and are
      being treated, quantitative, non-invasive techniques are needed to assess response to
      therapy. This project is designed to develop and test quantitative tests using blood, urine,
      or sputum samples.
