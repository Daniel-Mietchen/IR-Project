TITLE:
Studies of Patients With Skin Disease, Patients With Neurological Degenerations, and Normal Volunteers

CONDITION:
Healthy

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      It is proposed that patients with skin disease due to presumed immunologic, genetic or
      viral-induced abnormalities, patients with neurological degenerations, and normal controls
      be evaluated with various in vitro studies of immunologic, genetic, and virologic function.
      This is to include studies of peripheral blood (cells and serum) as well as studies of skin
      obtained with a biopsy instrument. In addition, studies of gastrointestinal function will be
      performed where appropriate.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      It is proposed that patients with skin disease due to presumed immunologic, genetic or
      viral-induced abnormalities, patients with neurological degenerations, and normal controls
      be evaluated with various in vitro studies of immunologic, genetic, and virologic function.

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: N/A to N/A
Criteria:

        Patients with skin diseases of presumed genetic, immunologic, or virologic origin are
        eligible.

        Patients with neurological degenerations are eligible, including patients with
        inflammatory, neoplastic and viral skin diseases and also heterozygous carriers of such
        inherited diseases.

        Volunteers without skin diseases are eligible, except children.
