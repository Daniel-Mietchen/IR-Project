TITLE:
Cell Selection for Bone Marrow Transplants to Prevent Graft-Versus-Host-Disease

CONDITION:
Graft vs Host Disease

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      Blood contains different kinds of cells, white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets.
      In order to treat certain diseases, specific cell types can be removed from blood and
      transplanted into patients. The process of removing white blood cells for the treatment of
      leukemia is called apheresis.

      This study will make available blood cell collections from volunteers genetically matched to
      various degrees with recipients in order to test and, if necessary, refine the process of
      removing white blood cell T-lymphocytes.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      This protocol has been written to make available apheresis collections from volunteers
      matched to various degrees with recipients in order to test and, if necessary refine, the
      selective immunodepletion procedure prior to introducing it in a clinical trial.
