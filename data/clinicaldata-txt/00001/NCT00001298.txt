TITLE:
A Trial of Carboxypeptidase-G2 (CPDG2) and Thymidine for the Management of Patients With Methotrexate Toxicity and Renal Dysfunction

CONDITION:
Kidney Diseases

INTERVENTION:
carboxypeptidase-G2

SUMMARY:

      High dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue has demonstrated activity in numerous
      malignancies. Although high dose methotrexate is generally well tolerated, unpredictable
      life-threatening toxicity can occur. For patients who have markedly delayed clearance of
      methotrexate secondary to renal dysfunction, therapeutic options are few and are of limited
      efficacy. Carboxypeptidase-G2 inactivates methotrexate by hydrolyzing its C-terminal
      glutamate residue. Carboxypeptidase-G2 could be used to rescue patients with renal
      dysfunction and delayed methotrexate excretion, as it provides an alternative to renal
      clearance as a route of elimination.

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: N/A to N/A
Criteria:

        Patients of any age at risk for life-threatening toxicity following MTX administration
        secondary to delayed drug excretion as defined by:

        Plasma MTX concentration at least 10 micromoles/liter more than 42 hours after the start
        of the MTX infusion; OR

        Creatinine at least 1.5 times the upper limit of normal or creatinine clearance less than
        60 ml/sqm/min and delayed MTX excretion documented by plasma MTX concentration
        measurements (at least 2 standard deviations above the mean) at least 12 hours following
        MTX administration.
