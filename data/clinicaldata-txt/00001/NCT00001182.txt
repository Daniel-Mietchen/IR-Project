TITLE:
Evaluation of Patients With Unusual Diagnostic or Treatment Considerations

CONDITION:
Healthy

INTERVENTION:
current standard of care treatments

SUMMARY:

      This study offers evaluation and treatment of patients with unusual diagnostic or treatment
      considerations. It is not designed to test new treatments; rather, patients will receive
      current standard of care treatments. The purposes of the study are: 1) to allow NIDCR staff
      an opportunity to maintain and improve their clinical skills; and 2) to evaluate referred
      patients for research potential. (Participants in this protocol will not be required to join
      a research study; the decision will be voluntary.)

      Patients in need of dental/oral diagnosis and therapy of interest to NIDCR staff dentists
      may be eligible for this protocol. Participants will have a comprehensive dental examination
      and may receive part or all of their treatment at the NIDCR clinic. Diagnostic procedures,
      materials and treatments used in this study are limited to those widely accepted in
      dentistry and are non-experimental in nature.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      The proposed pilot project will allow the staff of the Dental Clinic Oral Medicine
      Fellowship Program to accept patients, for diagnosis and conventional therapy, which do not
      otherwise meet the criteria for any of the current NIDCR research protocols. This clinical
      examination and therapy by Dental Clinic practitioners will provide an excellent forum for
      the observation of oral conditions and phenomena that may generate scientific inquiries and
      provide valuable educational experiences consistent with the goals of the Oral Medicine
      Program.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: N/A to N/A
Criteria:

        Patients in need of dental/oral diagnosis and therapy which are of interest to one or more
        of the staff dentists.
