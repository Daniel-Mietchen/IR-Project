TITLE:
Evaluation and Treatment of Heart Disease in Patients Not Participating in Research

CONDITION:
Arrhythmia

INTERVENTION:
inpatient evaluation and management

SUMMARY:

      There is an important need to maintain clinical skills, provide quality training and
      expertise, and provide an environment that stimulates ideas for clinical research.

      This study permits inpatient evaluation and management of patients with heart disease who do
      not qualify to participate in studies currently being conducted by the Cardiology Branch of
      the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      expertise, and provide an environment that stimulates ideas for clinical research. This
      protocol permits inpatient evaluation and management of patients with heart disease who do
      not fulfill criteria for participation in existing Cardiology Branch research protocols.
