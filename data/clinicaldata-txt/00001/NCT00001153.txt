TITLE:
Visual Function and Ocular Pigmentation in Albinism

CONDITION:
Albinism

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      To study the relationship between visual function and ocular (iris, retina/choroidal)
      pigmentation in patients with albinism and other hypomelanotic disorders. To identify the
      carrier state in relatives of patients with ocular albinism.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Visual function and ocular pigmentation are being studied in patients with albinism and
      other disorders associated with hypopigmentation. The degree of ocular pigmentation is
      assessed clinically by estimating the melanin content of the iris, retinal pigment
      epithelium, and choroid. Visual function is measured in the conventional manner to study
      central vision, and electrophysiological methods to detect a misrouting of the visual
      pathways. The purpose of this study is to document the visual deficit and the pigmentary
      changes of patients with albinism, to observe their natural course, and to determine whether
      misrouting of the visual pathways is present and is correlated with pigmentation.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: N/A to N/A
Criteria:

        Patients have been recruited into the study by referral from an ophthalmologist or
        pediatrician.

        Entrance into the study was dependent upon clinical evidence of decreased or absent
        pigmentation in skin, hair, and/or eyes.

        The definition was purposefully broad to include the broad range of phenotype variations
        and clinical heterogeneity.

        The purpose of the study id to be able to document iris and retina/choroidal pigmentation
        and correlated these finding with visual function.
