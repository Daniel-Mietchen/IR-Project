TITLE:
Salivary Evaluation in Healthy Volunteers

CONDITION:
Healthy

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      Saliva is critical in maintaining oral health and comfort. Our laboratory has investigated
      several disorders of salivary glands. The purpose of this protocol is to obtain data from
      healthy volunteers for comparison with data from patients with salivary dysfunction. We plan
      to utilize the NIH Clinical Center Clinical Research Volunteer Program to solicit paid
      participation from healthy adults. Study procedures are accomplished in 2-3 outpatient
      visits that include an interview, saliva collection, lip biopsy, clinical laboratory
      studies, dry eye examination, and lip biopsy follow up, as needed. These are routine
      diagnostic procedures. Biopsy specimens may be used in clinical and laboratory studies, such
      as in vitro biochemical analysis or in vivo transplantation.

      Some of the Healthy Volunteers may be asked to participate in an MRI study of the salivary
      glands.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      -  Objective: To obtain data from healthy volunteers for comparison with data from
           patients with salivary dysfunction.

        -  Study population: Healthy volunteers aged 18-70 years old

        -  Design: Observational

        -  Outcome measures: Clinical and basic science data to serve as controls for comparisons
           with subjects presenting with salivary gland dysfunction

      Some of the Healthy Volunteers may be asked to participate in an MRI study of the salivary
      glands.

      The outcome measurement for this study is to determine those healthy subjects whose data and
      specimens can be used as control comparison for our patient subjects in our
      Sj(SqrRoot)(Delta)gren s syndrome studies (84-D-0056, 99-D-0070, 11-D-0094 and/or
      11-D-0172).
