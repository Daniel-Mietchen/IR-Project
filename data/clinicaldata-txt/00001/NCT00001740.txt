TITLE:
Evaluation of Left Ventricular Volumes by Real-Time 3-Dimensional Echocardiography

CONDITION:
Heart Diseases

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      Quantitative measurements of left ventricular volume and ejection fraction are useful in the
      management of patients with heart disease. Several imaging methods exist, but are limited by
      cost, invasiveness, or exposure to radio-isotopes. Conventional echocardiography is a
      noninvasive method that allows estimation of left ventricular size and function; however,
      quantitative measurements of volume are not widely used due to lack of reproducibility and
      inaccurate measurements. Real-time three-dimensional echocardiography is a new technique
      that can be used to derive volume measurements from a single image acquisition. We
      hypothesize that real-time three-dimensional echocardiography is an accurate method for
      making left ventricular volume measurements. We therefore propose to measure left
      ventricular volumes using real-time three-dimensional echocardiography in human subjects and
      correlate these measurements with magnetic resonance imaging, a more accurate noninvasive
      method for obtaining these measurements.
