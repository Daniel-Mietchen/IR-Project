TITLE:
Signs and Symptoms of Genetic Abnormalities Linked to Inherited Heart Disease

CONDITION:
Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic, Familial

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      Genetically inherited heart diseases (familial cardiomyopathies) are conditions affecting
      the heart passed on to family members through abnormalities in genetic information. These
      conditions are responsible for many heart related deaths and illnesses.

      In this study researchers hope to determine the signs and symptoms (clinical correlation)
      associated with specific genetic abnormalities causing inherited heart diseases.

      In order to do this, researchers plan to evaluate patients and family members of patients
      diagnosed with inherited heart disease. Patients participating in the study will undergo
      several tests including blood tests, electrocardiograms (EKG), and echocardiograms. Patients
      may also be asked to undergo an MRI of the heart to provide a clearer picture of it.

      Patients participating in this study may not be directly benefited by it. However,
      information gathered from the study may contribute to the medical care, treatment, and
      prevention of problems for others in the future.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Familial cardiomyopathy (FC) often demonstrates both non-allelic and allelic genetic
      heterogeneity. We propose to determine the clinical correlates of specific genetic defects
      which cause FC by identifying and expanding a set of kindreds with identical and distinct
      molecular defects.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: N/A to N/A
Criteria:

        Individuals with cardiomyopathy referred for evaluation to the NIH.
