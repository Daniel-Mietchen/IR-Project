TITLE:
Treatment of Non-Tuberculous Mycobacterial Infections With Interferon Gamma

CONDITION:
Healthy

INTERVENTION:
interferon gamma

SUMMARY:

      This is an open label study to determine the effects of the administration of
      Interferon-gamma on the clinical condition and immune function of patients with severe,
      treatment refractory non-tuberculosis mycobacterial infections. The study drug (interferon
      gamma) will be administered subcutaneously three times a week at 0.05 mg/m(2) for one year.
      We may also collect blood from the relatives of these patients and normal volunteers in
      order to characterize the genetic basis, if any, of our patients' disorders.
