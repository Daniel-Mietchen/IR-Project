TITLE:
Study of a Flu Vaccine in Children

CONDITION:
Influenza

INTERVENTION:
Influenza virus vaccine (CAIV-T)

SUMMARY:

      This study tests the safety and effectiveness of a flu vaccine in school children.

      School children are usually the first members of a community to come down with the flu, and
      they often give the flu to their younger siblings, parents, and grandparents. It is hoped
      that giving school children a flu vaccine can help prevent the spread of the flu to other
      members of the community.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      This is a Phase III trial (an advanced study with a large number of patients). Your child
      will receive a single dose of flu vaccine, which is given by a nasal spray.
