Quality Control of Cardiopulmonary Exercise Equipment

CONDITION:
Healthy

INTERVENTION:
NONE

SUMMARY:

      This study is designed to make sure exercise equipment used by the National Heart, Lung, and
      Blood Institute is working properly. Healthy volunteers will be requested to use P-CCMB
      cardiopulmonary exercise equipment (treadmills and exercise bicycles) two times a month to
      ensure the machines are functioning properly.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Proper functioning of recently acquired P-CCMB cardiopulmonary exercise equipment will be
      verified by testing healthy volunteers. In addition, quality control will be verified by
      performing monthly testing of healthy volunteers as biologic standards.
