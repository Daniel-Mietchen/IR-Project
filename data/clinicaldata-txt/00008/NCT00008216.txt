TITLE:
Blood Stem Cell Transplant in Treating Patients With Hematologic Cancer

CONDITION:
Adult Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis

INTERVENTION:
Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Giving chemotherapy drugs and total-body irradiation before a donor peripheral
      blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It also helps stop the
      patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem cells
      from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem
      cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the effectiveness of donor peripheral blood stem
      cell transplant in treating patients with hematologic cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy and safety of allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell
           transplantation in achieving engraftment in patients with hematologic malignancy.

        -  Determine the hematopoietic recovery, incidence of chemoradiotherapeutic toxicity,
           relapse, graft-versus-host disease, and survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive a preparative chemoradiotherapeutic regimen and graft-versus-host
      disease prophylaxis prior to transplantation. Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood
      stem cell transplantation on day 0.

      Patients are followed every 1-2 weeks for 6 months and at 9, 12, 24, and 36 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 62 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.
