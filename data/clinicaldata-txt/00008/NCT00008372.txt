TITLE:
Chloroquinoxaline Sulfonamide in Treating Patients With Small Cell Lung Cancer

CONDITION:
Lung Cancer

INTERVENTION:
chloroquinoxaline sulfonamide

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chloroquinoxaline sulfonamide in
      treating patients who have small cell lung cancer that has not responded to platinum-based
      chemotherapy.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of chloroquinoxaline sulfonamide in patients with
      platinum-refractory small cell lung cancer. II. Determine the toxic effects of this drug in
      these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive chloroquinoxaline sulfonamide IV over 1 hour once a week for 4
      weeks. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients are followed until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-38 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18
      months.
