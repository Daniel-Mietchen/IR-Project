TITLE:
Ceramide Cream in Treating Women With Cutaneous Breast Cancer

CONDITION:
Breast Cancer

INTERVENTION:
ceramide

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of ceramide cream in treating women who
      have cutaneous breast cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective response rate in women with cutaneous breast cancer
      treated with topical ceramide cream. II. Determine the time to progression in patients
      treated with this regimen. III. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.
      IV. Assess the quality of life of these patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Topical ceramide cream is applied to all cutaneous lesions twice daily. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality
      of life is assessed at baseline and then at 1 and 3 months. Patients are followed every 3
      months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 4 years.
