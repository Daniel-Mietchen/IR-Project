TITLE:
Thiotepa Followed by Peripheral Stem Cell or Bone Marrow Transplant in Treating Patients With Malignant Glioma

CONDITION:
Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors

INTERVENTION:
filgrastim

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop tumor cells from
      dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell or bone
      marrow transplant may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill
      more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well thiotepa followed by peripheral stem cell
      or bone marrow transplant works in treating patients with malignant glioma.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the response rate, disease-free interval, and overall survival of patients
           with malignant glioma treated with high-dose thiotepa followed by autologous peripheral
           blood stem cell transplantation.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine whether this drug enters the cerebrospinal fluid of these patients.

      OUTLINE: Following a course of induction chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide IV over 4 hours,
      patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) daily until the completion of peripheral blood stem cell
      (PBSC) harvesting. PBSCs are collected over 3-5 days. Patients who do not mobilize
      sufficient cells undergo bone marrow harvest.

      Patients receive high-dose thiotepa IV over 5 hours on day -2. PBSCs or bone marrow are
      reinfused on day 0. Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously daily beginning on
      day 0 and continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 2-3 weeks for a
      total of 1-4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at every course, then monthly for 6 months, and
      then every 2 months thereafter.

      Patients are followed monthly for 6 months and then every 2 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 5-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
