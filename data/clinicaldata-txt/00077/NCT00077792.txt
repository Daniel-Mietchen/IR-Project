TITLE:
Enoxaparin and Thrombolysis Reperfusion for Acute Myocardial Infarction Treatment Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction - Study 25 (ExTRACT-TIMI25)

CONDITION:
Myocardial Infarction

INTERVENTION:
Enoxaparin sodium (XRP4563)

SUMMARY:

      The primary objective of the study is to determine whether enoxaparin compared to
      unfractionated heparin will reduce the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality and
      non-fatal myocardial re-infarction within 30 days after randomization in patients with acute
      ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction who are eligible to receive fibrinolytic therapy
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
NONE

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 18 Years to N/A

          -  Current therapy with oral anticoagulants, or an International Normalized Ratio of
             >1.5

          -  Administration of a low molecular weight heparin within 8 hours prior to
