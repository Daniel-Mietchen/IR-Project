TITLE:
Efficacy and Safety of Oral Bosentan on Healing/Prevention of Digital (Finger) Ulcers in Patients With Scleroderma

Digital Ulcers

INTERVENTION:
Bosentan 62.5 mg

      versus placebo. The purpose of the present trial (RAPIDS-2) is to evaluate the prevention
      and healing effects of bosentan versus placebo on digital ulcers over a 24-week treatment
      period.
