TITLE:
Child and Infant Learning Project

CONDITION:
Craniosynostosis

INTERVENTION:
neurobehavioral development

SUMMARY:

      To learn more about the cognitive and motor development of infants and young children born
      with a craniofacial defect called craniosynostosis.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      In the first phase of this multi-site, 10-year longitudinal study, infants with one of four
      types of single-suture craniosynostosis were recruited: sagittal, metopic, right unilateral
      coronal, and left unilateral coronal. A case-matched "control" group of healthy, normal
      infants was also followed. This study, which is now in its second phase, is following this
      same cohort of children at the age of 7 years.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 2 Months to 7 Years
Criteria:

        Enrollment criteria at Phase 1:

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of single-suture, nonsyndromic craniosynostosis (sagittal,
             metopic, unilateral coronal, or lambdoid)

          -  Corrective (cranioplastic) surgery not yet performed

          -  Child born at 34 weeks gestation or later

          -  Absence of neurological conditions/significant health problems

          -  33 months or younger at time of enrollment (male or female).

        Enrollment criteria at Phase 2:

        All participants enrolled in phase 1 are invited to participate in phase 2.
