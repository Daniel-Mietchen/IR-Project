TITLE:
3-AP and Gemcitabine as Second-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer

CONDITION:
Lung Cancer

INTERVENTION:
gemcitabine hydrochloride

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as 3-AP and gemcitabine, work in different ways
      to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving more than one drug may
      kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving 3-AP together with gemcitabine as
      second-line therapy works in treating patients with recurrent stage III or stage IV
      non-small cell lung cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the objective response rate in patients with stage III or IV recurrent
           non-small cell lung cancer treated with 3-AP (Triapine) and gemcitabine as second-line
           therapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the response duration, median time to progression, and overall survival of
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the effect of 3-AP (Triapine) on gemcitabine pharmacokinetics and cellular
           uptake into peripheral mononuclear cells in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center.

      Patients receive 3-AP (Triapine) IV over 4 hours and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days
      1, 8, and 15*. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *For course 1 only, gemcitabine is administered alone on day 1 and in combination with
      3-AP (Triapine) on days 8 and 15.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for up to 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-31 patients will be accrued for this study within 7.5-21
      months.
