TITLE:
Comparing Anastrozole-Placebo to the Combination Anastrozole-ZD1839 in Postmenopausal Patients With Estrogen Receptor and/or Progesterone Receptor Metastatic Breast Cancer

CONDITION:
Breast Cancer

INTERVENTION:
Gefitinib

SUMMARY:

      This study is being carried out to see if treatment with ZD1839 (Gefitinib) combined with
      Arimidex (Anastrozole) has improved efficacy over Arimidex alone in preventing progression
      of metastatic breast cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      This is a phase II, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
      Patients will be randomized in a double-blind manner in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 250
      mg/day ZD1839 or matched placebo in combination with 1 mg/day anastrozole. The dose of
      ZD1839 has been selected based on clinical studies in other tumor types suggesting identical
      efficacy together with a better toxicity profile in patients treated at 250 mg compared to
      500 mg/day. The 1 mg dose of anastrozole is the standard approved dose.
