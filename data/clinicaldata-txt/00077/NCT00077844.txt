TITLE:
Safety and Efficacy of Enoxaparin in Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) Patients, an International Randomized Evaluation (STEEPLE)

CONDITION:
Percutaneous Coronary Intervention

INTERVENTION:
Enoxaparin sodium

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous enoxaparin
      versus intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) in patients undergoing non-emergent PCI, as
      assessed by measuring the incidence of non-coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) major and
      minor bleeding.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
NONE

          -  Undergoing non-emergent single or multiple sites/vessels PCI during the same
             procedure

          -  PCI to be performed with a femoral approach

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

          -  Known or suspected pregnancy in women of childbearing potential

          -  Thrombolytic therapy within the previous 24 hours

          -  Undergoing primary PCI for ongoing ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)

          -  Undergoing rescue PCI after failed thrombolysis

          -  Any other elective PCI scheduled within the following 30 days after the index PCI

          -  Increased bleeding risk: ischemic stroke within the last year or any previous
             hemorrhagic stroke, intracranial tumor or aneurysm; recent (<1 month) trauma or major
             surgery (including bypass surgery); active bleeding

          -  Uncontrolled arterial hypertension

          -  Recent (<48 hours) or planned spinal/epidural anesthesia or puncture

          -  Impaired haemostasis: known International Normalized Ratio (INR) >1.5; past or
             present bleeding disorder (including congenital bleeding disorders such as von
             Willebrand's disease or hemophilia, acquired bleeding disorders, and unexplained
             clinically significant bleeding disorders), thrombocytopenia (platelet count
             <100,000/L)

          -  History of hypersensitivity or contraindication to heparin or LMWH

          -  Treatment with oral anticoagulant therapy within 72 hours prior to inclusion or
             current need for vitamin-K antagonist therapy

          -  Treatment with a direct thrombin inhibitor, low molecular weight heparin, or
             unfractionated heparin within the 24 hours preceding enrolment

          -  Use of abciximab within the previous 7 days or, tirofiban, or eptifibatide within the
             past 12 hours of index PCI

          -  Inability to give informed consent or high likelihood of being unavailable for
             follow-up

          -  Treatment with other investigational agents or devices within the previous 30 days,
             planned use of investigational drugs or devices, or previous enrollment in this trial
