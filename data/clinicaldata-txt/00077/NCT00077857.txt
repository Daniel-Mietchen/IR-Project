TITLE:
A Study to Assess Capecitabine (Xeloda) in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer

CONDITION:
Breast Cancer

INTERVENTION:
capecitabine (Xeloda)

SUMMARY:

      This 2 arm study compared the efficacy and safety of label dose of capecitabine (Xeloda) to
      that of a lower dose of Xeloda plus docetaxel (Taxotere) in patients with locally advanced
      or metastatic breast cancer after failure of chemotherapy with an anthracycline. Patients
      were randomized to receive either 1250 mg/m^2 or 825 mg/m^2 orally twice a day (po bid) on
      days 1-14 of each 3 week cycle, in combination with Taxotere 75 mg/m2 intravenous (iv) on
      day 1 of each 3 week cycle. The anticipated time on study treatment was until disease
      progression and the target sample size was 440 individuals.
