TITLE:
CCI-779 in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia

CONDITION:
Recurrent Adult Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma

INTERVENTION:
temsirolimus

SUMMARY:

      This phase II trial is studying how well CCI-779 works in treating patients with relapsed or
      refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as CCI-779, work
      in different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the activity of CCI-779 in patients with relapsed, refractory, or transformed
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease (relapsed or refractory chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia [CLL] vs transformed CLL).

      Patients receive CCI-779 IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients achieving an objective response may receive 3 consolidation courses of
      therapy.

                    -  Primary resistant disease defined as failure to achieve an objective
