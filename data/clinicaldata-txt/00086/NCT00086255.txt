TITLE:
Tiagabine for the Treatment of Cocaine Dependence - 1

CONDITION:
Cocaine-Related Disorders

INTERVENTION:
Tiagabine

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to assess tiagabine for the treatment of cocaine dependence.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      To assess the efficacy and safety of tiagabine in reducing cocaine use in subjects with
      cocaine dependence. It is hypothesized that tiagabine treatment, compared to placebo, will
      be associated with fewer days of cocaine use as assessed by self-report confirmed with urine
      assays for benzoylecgonine (BE). This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group
      design study, in which, after screening and a 2-week baseline assessment period, subjects
      will be equally randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups, tiagabine or matched placebo.
