TITLE:
Prevention of Vascular Access Graft Failure in Patients With Chronic Renal Failure Requiring Hemodialysis

CONDITION:
Hyperplasia

INTERVENTION:
edifoligide (E2F Decoy)

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of recipient vein pretreatment of
      edifoligide (E2F Decoy), compared to placebo, on graft/recipient vein stenosis in
      polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) vascular access grafts placed for hemodialysis at 6 months
      after enrollment.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
NONE

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 18 Years to 79 Years
Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be scheduled to undergo placement of a new straight or loop arm PTFE arteriovenous
             hemodialysis access graft or a Vectragraft (Thoratec, Inc.)

          -  Be currently receiving chronic dialysis or be expected to begin hemodialysis within 4
             weeks of placement of the index PTFE graft

          -  Have undergone an assessment of patency (such as venography) of central veins if any
             of the following conditions have occurred on the ipsilateral arm intended for graft
             placement: presence of collateral veins, upper extremity edema or increased size
             (relative to the contralateral arm), history of subclavian catheter, transvenous
             pacemaker, or history of trauma or surgery that may have involved the neck or chest
             veins

          -  Be > 18 and <80 years old

          -  Have a documented negative serum pregnancy test (for all women of childbearing
             potential)

          -  Be using an acceptable method of birth control if of reproductive potential and agree
             to continue using the birth control for at least 3 months following the graft
             procedure

          -  Have agreed to participate voluntarily and have signed and dated an IRB/EC approved,
             Patient Informed Consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have an intended recipient vein >6 mm or <3 mm in diameter

          -  Have a history of three or more previous PTFE grafts

          -  Have uncorrected central vein (including the subclavian vein) stenosis

          -  Have markedly diminished arterial pulses in the access location (unless adequate flow
             has been documented by arteriography or Doppler ultrasound)

          -  Anticipate receipt of a renal transplant within 6 months of enrollment into this
             study

          -  Have anticipated use of the index PTFE graft <14 days after enrollment (this does not
             apply to Vectragraft)

          -  Have a known allergy to iodinated contrast

          -  Have a known hypercoagulable state (e.g., antithrombin III deficiency;
             antiphospholipid or anticardiolipin antibodies; Factor V Leiden; circulating lupus
             anticoagulant; current, active, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia; Protein C or S
             deficiency; or a history of recurrent deep venous thrombosis not related to AV
             access)

          -  Have been in another investigational (i.e., nonapproved) drug or device study within
             the previous 30 days or prior participation in another clinical study with E2F Decoy

          -  Have been previously enrolled in this study for an earlier access graft

          -  Have any comorbid, nonrenal condition that makes 6-month survival questionable (e.g.,
             end-stage cancer, advanced heart failure)

          -  Have a known or suspected history of drug or alcohol abuse within the previous 6
             months

          -  Have a known allergy to any component of the investigational product (drug or
             device), including latex
