TITLE:
Effectiveness and Safety Study of Pentosan Polysulfate Sodium for the Treatment of Interstitial Cystitis

CONDITION:
Interstitial Cystitis

INTERVENTION:
Pentosan polysulfate sodium 100 mg

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of pentosan
      polysulfate sodium 100 mg once a day, pentosan polysulfate sodium 100 mg three times a day,
      and placebo for 24 weeks for the relief of bladder pain or discomfort associated with
      interstitial cystitis.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      The purpose of this multi-center, double-blind (neither the patient nor the physician knows
      whether drug or placebo is being taken, or at what dosage), randomized (patients are
      assigned different treatments based on chance), parallel group trial is to evaluate the
      effectiveness and safety of two doses of pentosan polysulfate sodium (100 mg once a day and
      100 mg three times a day) versus placebo for 24 weeks for the relief of bladder pain or
      discomfort associated with interstitial cystitis. The hypothesis of the study is that there
      is no treatment difference in the proportion of responders at study endpoint (Week 24).
      Effectiveness will be assessed based on the reduction in the O'Leary-Sant Interstitial
      Cystitis Symptom Index (ICSI) total score. Safety assessments include vital signs,
      laboratory tests, adverse events and physical exams. Patients will receive one of the
      following study treatments by mouth each day for 24 weeks: pentosan polysulfate sodium 100
      mg once a day group - one pentosan polysulfate sodium 100 mg capsule in the morning, and one
      matching placebo capsule in the afternoon and evening; pentosan polysulfate sodium 100 mg
      capsule three times a day group - one pentosan polysulfate sodium 100 mg capsule in the
      morning, afternoon and evening; placebo group - one placebo capsule in the morning,
      afternoon and evening

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have a total score of 8 or greater on the O'Leary-Sant Interstitial Cystitis
             Symptom Index (ICSI) and a score of > 0 on each of the 4 questions on the ICSI

          -  must have experienced bladder pain, urinary urgency and urinary frequency, each not
             related to a urinary tract infection, for at least 6 months prior to entry into the
             study

          -  must have averaged >= 10 voids per day (>=30 voids over 3 consecutive days) and
             averaged >= 1 void at night

          -  urine culture showing no evidence of urinary tract infection

          -  urine cytology showing no evidence of neoplastic cells

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Scheduled for or use of intravesical therapy (eg, bladder distention, dimethyl
             sulfoxide) during or within 4 weeks prior to the study

          -  patients who have had cytoscopic evaluation within 4 weeks prior to the study

          -  patients who are currently (within last month) receiving other medications that may
             affect symptoms of interstitial cystitis (ie, antidepressants, antihistamines,
             antispasmodics, anticholinergics)

          -  patients who are chronic users of Schedule II narcotics or who are using any
             scheduled narcotics at the time of study entry
