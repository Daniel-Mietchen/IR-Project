TITLE:
Study of Ovarex (Oregovomab) MAb With Front-Line Chemotherapy for Ovarian Cancer Treatment

CONDITION:
Ovarian Cancer

INTERVENTION:
oregovomab

SUMMARY:

      An experimental treatment with OvaRex MAb-B43.13 (oregovomab), called immunotherapy is
      being tested in ovarian cancer patients. Immunotherapy causes the body's defenses to react
      against cancer cells. The purpose of this research study is to determine if immunotherapy
      with oregovomab can create an immune response and enable the body to fight the disease and
      help ovarian cancer patients live longer. Patients with a possible diagnosis of ovarian
      cancer will be screened for study participation pre-surgery and, if eligible, will receive
      oregovomab during front-line chemotherapy treatment for ovarian cancer and quarterly for
      about a year following chemotherapy. Patients who experience disease progression will be
      discontinued from oregovomab therapy. Patients will also have urine, blood and tissue
      samples collected to assess the immune response to oregovomab.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
NONE

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: Female
Age: N/A to 80 Years
Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A histologic diagnosis of primary peritoneal carcinoma or epithelial ovarian
             carcinoma, Stage III - IV, expressing the tumor-associated antigen CA125 as measured
             by a serum CA125 level  35 U/mL and tumor tissue which has been demonstrated by
             immunohistochemical methods to express CA125. All patients must provide primary tumor
             (and lymph node and ascites samples, if available) samples for cellular immunology
             assays and characterization

          -  A functional performance status of 2 on the ECOG scale

          -  Are randomized into the study no more than eight (8) weeks postoperatively

          -  Have an expected survival of at least 6 months

          -  Age less than or equal to 80 years of age

          -  Be willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study

          -  Have given written informed consent, prior to any study-related procedure not part of
             normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the
             patient at any time without prejudice to their future medical care

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have received radiotherapy or chemotherapy

          -  Have circumstances at the time of entry onto the protocol would not permit completion
             of study or require follow-up

          -  Have other invasive malignancies, with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancer and
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix, who had (or have) any evidence of the other cancer
             present within the last 5 years or whose previous cancer treatment contraindicates
             this protocol therapy

          -  Have significant cardiovascular abnormalities [uncontrolled hypertension, Congestive
             Heart Failure (CHF) New York Heart Association (NYHA) Classes II-IV, see Appendix C),
             uncontrolled angina, myocardial infarction within the past six months or uncontrolled
             arrhythmias]. Patients with evidence of abnormal cardiac conduction (e.g. bundle
             branch block, heart block) are eligible if their disease has been stable for the past
             six months

          -  Have an active autoimmune disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, Systemic Lupus
             Erythematosus (SLE), ulcerative colitis, Crohn's Disease, MS, ankylosing spondylitis)
             requiring active immunosuppressive therapy

          -  Have a known allergy to murine proteins or have had a documented anaphylactic
             reaction to any drug

          -  Are being chronically treated with immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin,
             Adrenocorticotrophic Hormone (ACTH), or systemic corticosteroids

          -  Have a recognized immunodeficiency disease including cellular immunodeficiencies,
             hypogammaglobulinemia or dysgammaglobulinemia; patients who have acquired,
             hereditary, congenital immunodeficiencies, Human Immunodeficiency Virus, or status
             post splenectomy

          -  Have an uncontrolled disease (e.g. deteriorating renal function or nephropathy,
             active hepatitis, etc.) other than cancer. Patients with chronic diseases that are
             well controlled (e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypertension) are eligible

          -  Are taking mono-amine oxidase inhibitors or who have other contraindications to the
             use of pressor agents (e.g. epinephrine)

          -  Are unable to read or understand, and/or unwilling to sign a written consent form
             which must be obtained prior to surgery and prior to treatment Surgery

          -  Patients will not be required to undergo second-look surgery (such surgery will be at
             the option of the investigator)

          -  If patients undergo a second surgical procedure for a clinically indicated
             circumstance, an interval tumor sample with ascites and lymph node (if available)
             should be obtained, if present, for immunological evaluation and provided to the
             study tissue bank
