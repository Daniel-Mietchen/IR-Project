TITLE:
A Safety and Efficacy Study of Xolair in Peanut Allergy

CONDITION:
Allergy

INTERVENTION:
Xolair (omalizumab)

SUMMARY:

      This is a 38-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial of
      approximately 150 patients who have a history of immediate hypersensitivity reaction to
      peanut protein.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
NONE

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 6 Years to 75 Years
Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has a diagnosis of acute peanut allergy

          -  The patient meets the Xolair dosing table eligibility criteria by having a serum
             baseline IgE level between 30 and 1300IU/mL, and a body weight between 20 and 150
             kilograms

          -  The patient is six to 75 years of age

          -  The patient reacts to peanut flour but not wheat (placebo) flour during the first
             Oral Food Challenge (OFC)

          -  The patient has a positive skin prick test to peanut or detectable serum
             peanut-specific IgE level

          -  The patient is able to swallow capsules

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have FEV1 value <80% predicted or any clinical features of moderate persistent
             asthma, as defined by the NHLBI guidelines

          -  Have other significant medical conditions (e.g., liver, gastrointestinal, kidney,
             cardiovascular, pulmonary disease, or blood disorders), which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, make the subject unsuitable for induction of food reactions

          -  Have a history of allergy to wheat protein

          -  Have previously been exposed to monoclonal antibody treatment
