TITLE:
Safety and Pharmacokinetics of XL647 Administered Orally to Subjects With Solid Tumors

CONDITION:
Cancer

INTERVENTION:
XL647

SUMMARY:

      The primary objective of this study is as follows:

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of XL647 administered orally as a single dose
           and as repeat doses in subjects with solid tumors.

      The secondary objectives of this study are as follows:

        -  To evaluate the plasma pharmacokinetics of XL647 administered orally as a single dose
           and as repeat doses in subjects with solid tumors,

        -  To estimate renal elimination of XL647 administered orally as a single dose in subjects
           with solid tumors.

      The exploratory objective of this study is as follows:

        -  To assess the pharmacodynamic effects of XL647 administration in plasma and peripheral
           blood cells.

      In addition, subjects may be eligible to enter a Treatment Extension Period. The following
      information will be obtained from this part of the study:

        -  Long-term safety and tolerability of XL647 after repeat administration,

        -  Tumor response after repeat administration of XL647.

             are no longer effective,

          -  The subject has disease that is assessable by tumor marker, physical, or radiologic
             means,

          -  The subject is 18 years old,

          -  There have been at least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy (6

          -  The subject has a life expectancy of 3 months,

          -  The subject has normal organ and marrow function (hemoglobin >10g/dL, leukocytes
             >3,000/mL, absolute neutrophil count >1,500/L, platelets >100,000/L, total
             bilirubin within normal institutional limits of normal,AST (SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) <2.5
             times the upper limit of normal, and creatinine within normal limits,

          -  The subject is capable of understanding and complying with the protocol and has
             signed the informed consent document,

          -  Sexually active subjects (both male and female) must use an accepted method of
             contraception during the course of the study,

             pregnancy test.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or has not recovered from
             AEs due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier,

          -  The subject has received another investigational agent within 30 days (or 5.5
             half-lives) of the first dose of study drug,

          -  The subject has known brain metastases,

          -  The subject has a corrected QT interval (QTc) of >0.44 seconds,

          -  The subject has a history of allergic reactions attributed to aspartame or to any
             other component in the formulation vehicle,

          -  The subject has an uncontrolled intercurrent illness including,but not limited to
             ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would
             limit compliance with study requirements,
