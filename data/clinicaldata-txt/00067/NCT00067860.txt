TITLE:
Diet/Growth Factor Mechanisms of Gut Adaptation

CONDITION:
Short Bowel Syndrome

INTERVENTION:
recombinant human growth hormone

SUMMARY:

      This is a double-blind randomized controlled study on the clinical and metabolic effects and
      underlying gut mucosal mechanisms of modified diet, with or without recombinant human growth
      hormone, in adults with severe short bowel syndrome dependent upon parenteral nutrition.
      Clinical endpoints include ability to wean patients from parenteral feeding, metabolic
      endpoints include gut nutrient absorptive function and molecular endpoints include
      expression of growth factors and nutrient transporters in small bowel and colonic mucosa.
      The 6-month study is performed, in part, in the General Clinical Research Center for
      inpatient stays and outpatient visits.
