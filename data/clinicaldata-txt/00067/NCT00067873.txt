TITLE:
Exercise Training in Obesity-prone Black and White Women

CONDITION:
Obesity

INTERVENTION:
Diet

SUMMARY:

      Overweight premenopausal Black and White women are randomized to either diet-only,
      diet+aerobic or diet+resistance exercise training. Diet/behavior intervention, with or
      without the aerobic or resistance exercise training, will be provided throughout the 18
      months of study. Major outcomes will include measures of perceived and physiologic
      difficulty of exercise (cardiac, ventilatory, electromyographic responses to standardized
      exercise tasks); aerobic fitness; strength fitness; and spontaneous free-living energy
      expenditure (all derived from doubly labeled water). The results will provide insight into
      the effectiveness of, and the mechanisms by which, different types of exercise training can
      improve physical fitness, spontaneous engagement in physical activities of daily living and,
      in turn, weight-loss maintenance.
