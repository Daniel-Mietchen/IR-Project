TITLE:
Emotional Disclosure in HIV

CONDITION:
HIV Infections

INTERVENTION:
Trauma writing

SUMMARY:

      The specific objective of this study are to examine whether or not a treatment aimed at
      emotional disclosure may have beneficial psychological, health and immune effects for HIV
      infected individuals. The goal of the current study is to test the efficacy of emotional
      disclosure through writing in patients with HIV infection. We will compare emotional
      disclosure through writing about traumatic experiences (experimental intervention) to a
      control intervention (writing about emotionally neutral topics). [Note that HIV RNA viral
      load, CD4 T cells, urinary cortisol, health related dysfunction, psychological distress, and
      medication adherence are the 6 primary outcome variables.
