TITLE:
A Phase IIIB Study Evaluating the Effect on Serum Lipids Following a Switch to Atazanavir in HIV Infected Subjects Evidencing Virologic Suppression on Their First PI-Based Antiretroviral Therapy

CONDITION:
HIV Infections

INTERVENTION:
Atazanavir (immediate switch)

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this clinical research study is to learn if atazanavir is associated with
      serum LDL cholesterol in HIV-infected subjects following a substitution of atazanavir for
      their previously administered protease inhibitor.

               2. heart rate < 40 bpm

               3. any of the following EKG abnormalities:

             i) pause length > 3 seconds ii) second or third degree AV heart block iii) QTc
             interval > 450 msec for males iv) QTc interval > 470 msec for females

          -  Fasting serum triglyceride level > 750 mg/dL

               2. total serum lipase greater than or equal to 1.4 times the upper limit of normal

               3. liver transaminases greater than or equal to 3 times the upper limit of normal

               4. total serum bilirubin greater than or equal to 1.5 times the upper limit of
                  normal

          -  Hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation of study drug

          -  Use of any lipid-lowering agent within 4 weeks prior or during study

          -  Use of a PI-containing ARV regimen prior to entry which is comprised of more than one
             PI

          -  Inclusion of an NNRTI in the PI-containing regimen

          -  Prisoners or subjects involuntary incarcerated for treatment of psychiatric or
