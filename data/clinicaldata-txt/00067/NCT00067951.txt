TITLE:
A Study To Evaluate The Safety And Efficacy Of An Investigational Diabetes Drug In Poorly Controlled Type II Diabetics

CONDITION:
Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2

INTERVENTION:
rosiglitazone/metformin

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this research study is to determine if a new investigational diabetes drug is
      safe and effective in treating people who have Type II diabetes mellitus with very high
      HbA1c or FPG (fasting plasma glucose) levels. The HbA1c test, also called the hemoglobin A1c
      test or glycated hemoglobin test, is a measurement of the average amount of sugar in the
      blood over the last 2 to 3 months. FPG is a test that measures the amount of sugar in the
      blood after an 8 hour fast.
