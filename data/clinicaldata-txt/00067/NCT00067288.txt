TITLE:
Meaning-Centered Psychotherapy in Advanced Cancer

CONDITION:
Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin

INTERVENTION:
Meaning-Centered Group Psychotherapy

SUMMARY:

      We have developed an 8-week Meaning-Centered Group Psychotherapy designed to help patients
      with advanced cancer sustain or enhance a sense of meaning, peace and purpose despite the
      limitations of their cancer illness. This project's overall aim is to explore the
      feasibility and efficacy of this new and unique psychotherapy intervention for advanced
      cancer patients in enhancing psychological and spiritual well-being and quality of life by
      comparing it with a standard supportive group psychotherapy.
