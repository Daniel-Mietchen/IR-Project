ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 18 Years to N/A
Criteria:

        - Adults with hypertension on hemodialysis Hypertensive, long-term (3 months or more)
        hemodialysis patients will be studied over a 6 hemodialysis baseline phase during which
        44-hour interdialytic ambulatory BP will be performed and baseline symptoms collected.
        Patients with well-controlled hypertension, on anti-hypertensive therapy will have blood
        pressure medications withdrawn until they become hypertensive as assessed by 44-hour
        interdialytic ambulatory blood pressure recording. We will exclude patients who have had
        vascular event (stroke, myocardial infarction or limb ischemia requiring bypass) within
        previous six months, ambulatory BP >170 mm Hg systolic or >100 mm Hg diastolic, those who
        miss 2 or more hemodialysis treatments in the previous month, abuse street-drugs, require
        home oxygen, have symptomatic congestive heart failure or are morbidly obese (body mass
        index > 40 kg/m2).
