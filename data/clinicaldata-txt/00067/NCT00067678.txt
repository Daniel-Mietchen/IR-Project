TITLE:
Soy Protein in Early Diabetic Nephropathy

CONDITION:
Diabetic Nephropathy

INTERVENTION:
soy protein

SUMMARY:

      Diabetic nephropathy is a frequent cause of end-stage renal disease. Reduction of dietary
      protein has been used to slow down renal disease progression, but patients are often
      unwilling to make these dietary changes. Other research suggests that changing the quality
      of dietary protein may be as effective as reducing the total amount of ingested protein.
      This study hopes to show that soy protein, a plant protein relatively high in essential
      amino acids and with high nutritional value, maye be beneficial to Type I diabetic patients
      with incipient renal disease.
