TITLE:
Oxidative Stress and Vitamin E Requirements

CONDITION:
Smoking

INTERVENTION:
Vitamin E with and without Vitamin C

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to determine if oxidative stress derived from cigarette smoking
      increases vitamin E requirements. The study will also assess the role of vitamin C in
      modulating vitamin E requirements. Vitamin E requirements will be assessed by measuring
      vitamin E in plasma as well as by measuring the excreted vitamin E metabolite in the urine.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      We will be investigating the fractional disappearance rate of tocopherols in cigarette
      smokers compared to nonsmokers. This will be accomplished by supplementing individuals with
      deuterium labeled alpha- and gamma-tocopherols. Quantification of plasma tocopherols as well
      as urinary metabolites, alpha- and gamma-carboxy ethyl hydroxychromanol, will be determined
      using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis. In addition, the role of vitamin C
      as it pertains to its influence on the fraction disappearance rate of vitamin E will also be
      evaluated.
