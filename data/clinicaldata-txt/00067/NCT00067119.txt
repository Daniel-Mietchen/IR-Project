TITLE:
Vascular Access Clinical Trials Data Coordinating Center

CONDITION:
Kidney Failure

INTERVENTION:
Aggrenox

SUMMARY:

      Fistula Study: The objective of the study is to determine whether clopidogrel reduces the
      early failure rate of native AV fistulae.

      Graft Study: The objective of the study is to determine whether Aggrenox
      (Boehringer-Ingelheim) prolongs primary unassisted patency in newly created arteriovenous
      grafts.

             myocardial infarction or a cerebrovascular accident within the past 12 months.

          -  The patient is expected to stay at a participating dialysis facility for at least 6
             months.

          -  The patient's physician(s) will allow the patient to participate.

          -  Ability to give informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             disease).

          -  Recent bleeding episode requiring transfusion within 12 weeks of entry.

          -  The presence of acute ulcer disease. Acute ulcer disease is defined as a new
             diagnosis of peptic disease including esophagitis, gastritis, or ulcer or the

             Helicobacter pylori within three months prior to obtaining consent.

          -  A condition which prohibits discontinuation of anticoagulant drugs, aspirin, or
             nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs dudring the six week study drug administration
             period. Use of heparin during dialysis is allowed.

          -  Required use of oral or intravenous glucocorticoids at a dose greater than the
             equvalent of prednisone 15 mg per day during the six week study drug administration
             period.

          -  Current unstable angina.

          -  Required use of clopidogrel.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to clopidogrel.

          -  Medical considerations making anti-platelet therapy dangerous.

          -  Current uncontrolled hypertension with systolic blood pressure in excess of 200 mm Hg
             or diastolic blood pressure in excess of 115 mm Hg at the time of enrollment.

          -  Baseline platelet count less than 75,000/mm3.

          -  Known advanced liver disease with decompensated cirrhosis, jaundice, ascites or
             bleeding varices.

          -  Current problem with substance abuse.

          -  Concurrent participation in another medical intervention trial.

          -  Anticipated non-compliance with medical care based on physician judgment.

          -  Patient refusal.

             enrollment, or current dialysis dependence

          -  A new or planned AV graft placed in any location for the purpose of hemodialysis.
             (Any type of graft material and any configuration of the access is acceptable).

          -  The patient is expected to stay at a participating dialysis facility for at least 6
             months.

          -  The patient's physician(s) will allow the patient to participate.
