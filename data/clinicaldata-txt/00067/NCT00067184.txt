TITLE:
Fetal Neurobehavioral Development in Methadone Maintained Pregnancies

CONDITION:
Opioid-Related Disorders

INTERVENTION:
Toitu 320/325

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to examine differences in fetal neurobehavior at peak (2 hours
      after oral dose) vs. trough (2 hours before oral dose) maternal plasma methadone levels.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      This study will examine differences in fetal neurobehavior at peak (2 hours after oral dose)
      vs. trough (2 hours before oral dose) plasma methadone levels. Anecdotal clinical
      observations suggest that fetal activity is increased at trough methadone levels and
      decreased at peak methadone levels, yet we do not understand how in utero methadone exposure
      affects fetal neurobehavioral state development.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: Female
Age: 18 Years to 40 Years
Criteria:

        Actively enrolled pregnant patients in CAP SA treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Maternal age 18-40 years

          -  Single intrauterine fetus

          -  Estimated gestational age of 32 weeks

          -  DSMIV criteria for opioid dependence according to e-module of the SCID

          -  Daily methadone maintenance at a stable dose for greater than a week

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concurrent DSMIV axis I diagnosis that would preclude informed consent procedures
             (i.e., schizophrenia, major depression) or confound study outcomes (e.g., Alcohol
             Dependence)

          -  Presence of a serious medical or psychiatric illness requiring chronic medication or
             other intervention (i.e., HIV infection) that may confound data interpretation

          -  Evidence of preterm labor

          -  Evidence of prescription drug use (e.g., antidepressants, tranquilizers)

          -  Presence of major congenital fetal malformation

          -  Recent use (last month) of other illicit drugs (e.g., cocaine, marijuana) based on
             self report or positive on-Trak urine drug toxicology at time of actograph sessions

          -  Split methadone dosing schedule
