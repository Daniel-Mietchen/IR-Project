TITLE:
Safety and Efficacy of Natalizumab in Combination With Remicade in the Treatment of Crohn's Disease

CONDITION:
Crohn's Disease

INTERVENTION:
natalizumab

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of
      natalizumab in individuals diagnosed with active Crohn's Disease that are not in remission
      (CDAI greater than/equal to 150) and are currently taking Remicade. It is thought that
      natalizumab may stop the movement of certain cells, known as white blood cells, into bowel
      tissue. These cells are thought to cause damage in the bowel leading to the symptoms of
      Crohn's disease.

      Patients who complete this study may be eligible for long-term natalizumab therapy via
      extension protocol ELN100226-351.
