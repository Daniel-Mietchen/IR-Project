TITLE:
Genetic Study of Familial Factors in Patients With Colon Cancer

CONDITION:
Colorectal Cancer

INTERVENTION:
cytogenetic analysis

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Genetic studies may help in understanding the genetic processes involved in the
      development of some types of cancer.

      PURPOSE: Clinical trial to study the cancer-related genes in patients who have colon cancer
      or adenomatous polyps.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Identify human colon neoplasia susceptibility genes in patients with colon cancer or
           adenomatous polyps.

        -  Correlate the inheritance of novel susceptibility alleles for adenomatous polyposis of
           the colon with colon neoplasia in these patients.

        -  Correlate colon neoplasia susceptibility with the presence of COX-2, sPLA2, and DNMT
           genes in these patients.

        -  Identify a novel gene that governs increased susceptibility to colon adenoma and cancer
           in the genome of these patients.
