TITLE:
Safety and Efficacy of PRO 542 in the Treatment of HIV-Infected Patients

CONDITION:
HIV Infections

INTERVENTION:
CD4-IgG2 (PRO 542)

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to determine any adverse effects of PRO 542 after
      administration and to determine the anti-HIV effects of PRO 542 in the patient.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      A 2 arm study involving a series of 3 triweekly doses of PRO 542. One arm will involve
      patients on a stable dose of anti-retroviral therapy and the other arm will consist of
      patients not receiving anti-retroviral therapy. Three patients will be enrolled in each arm
      followed by a safety evaluation. Following the safety evaluation, 3 more patients may be
      enrolled in each arm. After the first 12 patients, an additional 12 patients may be enrolled
      pending safety data.
