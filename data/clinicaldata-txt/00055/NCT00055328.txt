TITLE:
Treatment for Depression in the Primary Care Setting

CONDITION:
Depression

INTERVENTION:
Problem-Solving Treatment for Primary Care

SUMMARY:

      This study will compare a brief form of counseling to usual care for the treatment of minor
      depression in the primary care setting.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Minor depression is one of the most common types of depressive disorders seen in primary
      care. The effectiveness and tolerability of antidepressants in patients with minor
      depression is unclear, and the development of alternative treatments is necessary.

      In the first phase of this study, participants are observed for 4 weeks to identify those
      most in need of depression-specific treatment. Participants are then exposed to the
      Problem-Solving Treatment for Primary Care (PST-PC), a six-session behavioral treatment for
      depression. After 4 weeks, patients who do not respond adequately to the treatment are
      randomly assigned to either continued PST-PC or to usual care for 9 weeks. Participants are
      followed for 6 months after the study.
