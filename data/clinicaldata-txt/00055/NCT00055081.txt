DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      This study is a supplement to a parent study which concentrates on the outcomes of homeless
      mothers who are provided with services and housing. This study will focus on the effects of
      housing and services on children, who may be the major beneficiaries of such assistance.

      Participants are randomly assigned to either receive services and permanent housing or to
      remain in a homeless shelter without additional assistance. Children and their parents are
      interviewed separately 3, 9, and 15 months after study entry. The teachers of participating
      children are surveyed twice during the study.
