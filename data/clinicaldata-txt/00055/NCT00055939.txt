TITLE:
Exatecan Mesylate in Treating Children With Relapsed or Refractory Rhabdomyosarcoma

CONDITION:
Sarcoma

INTERVENTION:
exatecan mesylate

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of exatecan mesylate in treating children
      who have relapsed or refractory rhabdomyosarcoma.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the objective response rate (complete and partial responses) in pediatric
           patients with relapsed or refractory rhabdomyosarcoma treated with exatecan mesylate.

        -  Determine the time to tumor progression in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the median survival and survival at 6 and 12 months in patients treated with
           this drug.

        -  Assess pain in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Evaluate the quantitative and qualitative toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter study.

      Patients receive exatecan mesylate IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 3
      weeks for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients who achieve a complete response (CR) receive 6 additional courses beyond CR.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 13-27 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
