TITLE:
S0117 Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin Plus Cytarabine in Treating Patients With Relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia

CONDITION:
Leukemia

INTERVENTION:
cytarabine

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as gemtuzumab ozogamicin can locate cancer cells and
      either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.
      Drugs used in chemotherapy such as cytarabine use different ways to stop cancer cells from
      dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining gemtuzumab ozogamicin with cytarabine may
      kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining gemtuzumab ozogamicin with
      cytarabine in treating patients who have relapsed acute myeloid leukemia.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety and efficacy of gemtuzumab ozogamicin and cytarabine in patients
           with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia.

        -  Determine the frequency and severity of toxic effects of this regimen in CD33-positive
           patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the prognostic significance of drug resistance phenotype,
           cytogenetics, and molecular genetic characteristics of patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Induction: Patients receive gemtuzumab ozogamicin IV over at least 2 hours on days 1
           and 8 and cytarabine IV continuously over days 1-7.

        -  Consolidation: Beginning between days 28 and 75, patients who achieve A1 bone marrow,
           B1 peripheral blood, and C1 extramedullary disease status receive one course of
           gemtuzumab ozogamicin and cisplatin as in induction chemotherapy.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then
      annually for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-55 patients will be accrued for this study within 10-28
      months.
