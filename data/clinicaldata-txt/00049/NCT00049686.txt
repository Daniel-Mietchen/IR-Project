TITLE:
VNP40101M in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Leukemia or Myelodysplastic Syndrome

CONDITION:
Leukemia

INTERVENTION:
laromustine

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of VNP40101M in treating patients who have
      relapsed or refractory leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the toxic effects of VNP40101M in patients with relapsed or refractory
           leukemia or poor-risk myelodysplastic syndromes.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the antitumor effects of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive VNP40101M IV over 15 minutes once every 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
