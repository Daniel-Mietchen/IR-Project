TITLE:
Imatinib Mesylate in Treating Patients With Recurrent Brain Tumor

CONDITION:
Adult Anaplastic Oligodendroglioma

INTERVENTION:
Imatinib Mesylate

SUMMARY:

      This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of imatinib mesylate and to
      see how well it works in treating patients with a recurrent brain tumor that has not
      responded to previous surgery and radiation therapy. Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth
      of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify the maximum tolerated dose of imatinib (imatinib mesylate) in patients with
      recurrent oligodendroglioma and mixed oligoastrocytoma that are currently on enzyme inducing
      anticonvulsant therapy. (Study 1) II. To assess the efficacy of imatinib in patients with
      recurrent oligodendrogliomas and mixed oligoastrocytomas (with pathologic evidence of
      oligodendrogliomatous component) as measured by progression-free survival, response, and
      overall survival. (Study 2) III. To acquire pilot data on a patient group not traditionally
      eligible for recurrent oligodendroglioma and mixed oligoastrocytoma clinical trials (those
      having > 2 prior chemotherapy regimens or 2 prior chemotherapy regimens for
      recurrent/progressive disease). (Study 3) IV. To examine the toxicity and safety of imatinib
      in patients with recurrent oligodendrogliomas and mixed oligoastrocytomas (with pathologic
      evidence of oligodendrogliomatous component). (Studies 1, 2, and 3) V. To perform a
      preliminary correlative study of 1p/19q alterations, alpha platelet-derived growth factor
      receptor (PDFGR) gene amplification and levels of related downstream signaling elements in
      tumor tissue, with clinical study endpoints. (Studies 1, 2, and 3) VI. To perform a
      descriptive correlative analysis of steady state pharmacokinetic data regarding imatinib and
      active metabolites with the study endpoints. (Studies 1, 2, and 3)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II and a pilot study.

      PILOT STUDY (Study 3, Arms D [EIACs] and E [Non-EIACs]): Patients are stratified and
      assigned to treatment groups as in phase II. Patients receive imatinib mesylate PO as in
      phase II.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months until death.
