TITLE:
Ipilimumab After Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant in Treating Patients With Persistent or Progressive Cancer

CONDITION:
Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia With 11q23 (MLL) Abnormalities

INTERVENTION:
ipilimumab

SUMMARY:

      This phase I trial is studying how well ipilimumab works after allogeneic stem cell
      transplant in treating patients with persistent or progressive cancer. Monoclonal antibodies
      can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them
      without harming normal cells.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the dose of MDX-010 (ipilimumab) that can safely be administered to patients
      with persistent or progressive malignancy following allo-HCT.

      II. To determine the pharmacokinetics of different doses of MDX-010 administered as a single
      dose to patients with persistent or progressive malignancy following allo-HCT.

      III. By assessment of aims 1 and 2, to determine the best dosing regimen for further study
      of CTLA-4 blockade in conjunction with escalating dose donor-leukocyte infusions (DLI) in
      patients with evidence of residual or progressive malignancy following allo-HCT.

      IV. To assess if there is preliminary evidence of efficacy following the administration of
      MDX-010 in this population.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ipilimumab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of ipilimumab until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients with persistent or progressive disease at 60 days after ipilimumab administration
      and no evidence of graft-versus-host disease receive donor lymphocyte infusions every 60
      days for a total of 3 infusions.

      Patients are followed at 4, 5, 6, 9, and 12 months and then annually thereafter.
