TITLE:
High-Dose Chemotherapy, Total-Body Irradiation, and Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation or Bone Marrow Transplantation in Treating Patients With Hematologic Cancer or Solid Tumors

CONDITION:
Breast Cancer

INTERVENTION:
busulfan

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage cancer cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. Combining chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation or autologous bone
      marrow transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and
      kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well eight different high-dose chemotherapy
      regimens with or without total-body irradiation followed by autologous stem cell
      transplantation or autologous bone marrow transplantation works in treating patients with
      hematologic malignancies or solid tumors.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the morbidity, mortality, and overall outcome in patients with hematologic
           malignancies, breast cancer, or other chemosensitive solid tumors treated with
           disease-specific dose-intensive conditioning regimens and autologous peripheral blood
           or bone marrow transplantation.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to risk group (standard vs high). Standard risk
      includes acute leukemia in first relapse or second remission; lymphoma in responding first
      relapse or second remission; or breast cancer at risk for recurrence. High risk includes all
      others. Patients receive specific conditioning regimens according to diagnosis as outlined
      below.

      Conditioning

        -  Regimen A (standard risk non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and under 60 years of age)-Etoposide,
           cyclophosphamide, and total body irradiation (TBI) (VCT): Patients receive etoposide IV
           continuously over 26 hours beginning on day -5 and cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on
           day -4. Patients undergo TBI on days -3 to -1.

        -  Regimen B (any risk Hodgkin's lymphoma and under 60 years of age)-Cyclophosphamide,
           carmustine, and etoposide (CBV): Patients receive etoposide IV continuously over 34
           hours beginning on day -8; cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -7 to -4; and
           carmustine IV over 2 hours on day -3.

        -  Regimen C (any risk patient with prior exposure to high-dose etoposide and
           cyclophosphamide and under 60 years of age)-Melphalan and TBI (MEL/TBI): Patients
           receive melphalan IV over 30 minutes on day -4. Patients undergo TBI on days -3 to -1.

        -  Regimen D (multiple myeloma or amyloidosis)-Melphalan only (MEL only): Patients receive
           melphalan IV over 30 minutes on day -2.

        -  Regimen E (any patient unable to receive TBI)-Busulfan and cyclophosphamide: Patients
           receive oral busulfan (or busulfan IV over 2 hours) on days -7 to -4 and
           cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -3 and -2.

        -  Regimen F (any risk breast cancer)-Cyclophosphamide, carboplatin, and thiotepa (STAMP
           V): Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 24 hours, carboplatin IV over 24 hours,
           and thiotepa IV over 24 hours on days -7 to -4.

        -  Regimen G (solid tumors other than breast or testicular cancer)-Thiotepa and
           carboplatin (TT/CARBO): Patients receive thiotepa IV over 2 hours on days -6 and -5 and
           carboplatin IV continuously over 96 hours beginning on day -6.

        -  Regimen H (recurrent or primary progressive testicular cancer)-Etoposide and
           carboplatin (VP/CARBO): Patients receive etoposide IV over 2 hours and carboplatin IV
           over 30 minutes on days -6 to -4.

      Stem Cell Infusion

        -  In all regimens, patients undergo autologous stem cell infusion on day 0. Treatment
           continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 450 patients (50 patients [25 per stratum] per regimen)
      will be accrued for this study within 10 years.
