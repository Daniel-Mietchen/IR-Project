TITLE:
Pomegranate Juice in Treating Patients With Recurrent Prostate Cancer

CONDITION:
Prostate Cancer

INTERVENTION:
pomegranate juice

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Pomegranate juice may contain substances that decrease or slow the rise of
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and may be effective in delaying or preventing
      recurrent prostate cancer.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well pomegranate juice works in decreasing or
      slowing the rise of PSA levels in patients who have undergone radiation therapy or surgery
      for prostate cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine whether pomegranate juice can decrease or slow rising prostate-specific
           antigen (PSA) levels in patients who have undergone radical prostatectomy or
           radiotherapy for adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral pomegranate juice once daily. Treatment continues for 18
      months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 29-40 patients will be accrued for this study.

          -  Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate

          -  Must have undergone prior surgery or radiotherapy for the primary tumor

          -  Documented rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, defined by the following
             criteria:

          -  Absolute level of PSA at least 0.2 ng/mL but less than 5.0 ng/mL

          -  Rising PSA level must be confirmed at least 1 week later

          -  Adequate PSA time points to calculate a PSA doubling time

          -  Age 18 and over

          -  Performance status ECOG 0-1

          -  Life expectancy at least 6 months

          -  No other malignancy within the past 5 years except nonmelanoma skin cancer

          -  No other serious concurrent systemic medical disorders that would preclude study
             compliance

          -  No known allergy to pomegranate juice

          -  More than 4 weeks since prior participation in another experimental study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  nodal involvement

          -  evidence of metastatic disease

          -  prior hormonal therapy

          -  concurrent hormonal therapy for rising PSA levels after initial therapy for prostate
             cancer

          -  concurrent participation in another experimental study

          -  other concurrent systemic or local therapy for prostate cancer

          -  initiation or discontinuation of any new nutritional or dietary supplements during
             study participation
