TITLE:
Perifosine in Treating Patients With Metastatic, Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer

CONDITION:
Prostate Cancer

INTERVENTION:
perifosine

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as perifosine use different ways to stop tumor
      cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of perifosine in treating patients who
      have prostate cancer that no longer responds to androgen ablation therapy.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the 4-month progression-free survival rate, as measured by prostate-specific
           antigen and clinical criteria, in patients with metastatic androgen-independent
           prostate cancer treated with perifosine.

        -  Determine the side-effect profile of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Course 1: Patients receive oral perifosine twice on day 1 and once daily on days 2-21.

        -  All subsequent courses: Patients receive oral perifosine once daily on days 1-21.

      In all courses, treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-46 patients will be accrued for this study within
      approximately 1.5 years.

               -  Two consecutively rising prostate-specific antigen levels, at least 1 week
                  apart, with at least 1 measurement that is 50% above the nadir reached after the
                  last treatment regimen (as long as the last measurement is at least 5 ng/mL)

               -  At least 1 new metastatic lesion on technetium Tc 99m bone scintigraphy

               -  Progression of soft-tissue metastases as measured by appropriate modalities
                  (i.e., imaging or palpation) and demonstrated by at least 1 of the following:

                    -  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters (LD) of target
                       lesions from the smallest sum of LD recorded since the treatment started or
                       the appearance of 1 or more new lesions

          -  Patients who have not undergone surgical castration must have a testosterone level
             less than 50 ng/mL and continue on their LHRH agonist during study treatment
