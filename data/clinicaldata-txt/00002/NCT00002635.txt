TITLE:
Aminocamptothecin in Treating Patients With T-cell Lymphoma

CONDITION:
Lymphoma

INTERVENTION:
filgrastim

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of aminocamptothecin in treating patients
      with advanced cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the antitumor activity of aminocamptothecin (9-AC) administered by
      72-hour infusion in patients with advanced cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. II. Assess the toxic
      effects of 9-AC administered on this schedule.

      OUTLINE: Single-Agent Chemotherapy. Aminocamptothecin, 9-AC, NSC-603071.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued; if no more than 1 response is
      seen in the first 15 patients, the study will close. Probable duration of study is 18
      months.
    

ELIGIBILITY:

        normal measurement is available (e.g., mediastinal width on x-ray) Evaluable disease
        defined as malignant disease evident on physical or radiographic exam but not measurable
        by ruler or caliper, i.e.: Pelvic masses Confluent multinodular lung metastases Skin
        metastases CNS metastases eligible if stable for at least 4 weeks following completion of
        surgery or radiotherapy
