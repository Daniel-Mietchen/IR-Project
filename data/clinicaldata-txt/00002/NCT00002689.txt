TITLE:
Radiation Therapy Plus Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Pancreatic Cancer

CONDITION:
Pancreatic Cancer

INTERVENTION:
dexamethasone

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. Radiation therapy combined with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of brachytherapy followed by
      external-beam radiation therapy plus chemotherapy in treating patients who have pancreatic
      cancer that cannot be removed surgically.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the response/remission rate, survival, and degree of local control from
           interstitial colloidal phosphorus P32 followed by external beam radiotherapy and
           chemotherapy in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior therapy (yes vs no).

      Patients receive dexamethasone intratumorally, then macroaggregated albumin and interstitial
      phosphorus P32 intratumorally. Most patients receive a second course of this brachytherapy.

      Patients then proceed to chemoradiotherapy beginning 7-14 days after brachytherapy.
      Radiotherapy is administered 5 days a week for 6.4 weeks. Fluorouracil IV is administered
      every other day for 4 doses during weeks 1 and 2.

      Patients are followed monthly for 1 year then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 48 patients will be accrued for this study.
