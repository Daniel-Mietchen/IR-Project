TITLE:
High-Dose Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy Followed by Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation in Treating Patients With Acute Leukemia in Remission

CONDITION:
Bone Marrow Ablation

INTERVENTION:
filgrastim

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell
      transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill
      more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of high-dose radiation therapy and
      etoposide followed by peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients with acute
      leukemia.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy of myeloablative total-body irradiation and etoposide
      followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation in prolonging the
      disease-free survival of patients with acute leukemia. II. Investigate the ability of growth
      factor-primed PBSC to provide hematopoietic reconstitution following myeloablative therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are treated on Regimen A, then Regimen B. Regimen A: Stem Cell
      Mobilization. Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (Amgen), G-CSF, NSC-614629. Regimen B:
      Radiotherapy and Myeloablative Chemotherapy with Hematopoietic Rescue. Total-Body
      Irradiation, TBI (high-energy electrons used for lung boost); and Etoposide, VP-16,
      NSC-141540; with Peripheral Blood Stem Cells, PBSC; G-CSF.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 45 patients will be studied over approximately 3 years.
