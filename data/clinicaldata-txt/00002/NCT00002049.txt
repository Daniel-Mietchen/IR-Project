TITLE:
Double Blind Study of Thymopentin Effects on HIV-1 Infectivity of Blood Mononuclear Cells and Semen in HIV Infected Patients

CONDITION:
HIV Infections

INTERVENTION:
Thymopentin

SUMMARY:

      Examine the ability of Timunox (thymopentin) to reduce the amount and/or frequency of virus
      isolation. Examine the ability of thymopentin to stimulate the immune system and alter the
      clinical findings of patients infected with HIV who do not yet have AIDS.
