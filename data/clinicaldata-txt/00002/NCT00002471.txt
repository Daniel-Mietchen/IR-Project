TITLE:
Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Acute B-Lymphoblastic Leukemia or Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma

CONDITION:
Leukemia

INTERVENTION:
asparaginase

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating
      patients who have acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia or recurrent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Improve the survival of children and adolescents with poor-risk
      nonlymphoblastic lymphoma and acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia using an intensive,
      short-course regimen of combination chemotherapy. II. Assess the toxicity of the regimen.

      OUTLINE: Nonrandomized study. Induction: 7-Drug Combination Chemotherapy with Leucovorin
      Rescue plus Triple Intrathecal Therapy (TIT). Cyclophosphamide, CTX, NSC-26271; Thiotepa,
      TSPA, NSC-6396; Vincristine, VCR, NSC-67574; Daunorubicin, DNR, NSC-82151; Dexamethasone,
      DM, NSC-34521; Etoposide, VP-16, NSC-141540; Methotrexate, MTX, NSC-740; with Leucovorin
      calcium, Citrovorum Factor, CF, NSC-3590; plus TIT: IT MTX; IT Cytarabine, IT ARA-C,
      NSC-63878; IT Hydrocortisone, IT HC, NSC-10483. Consolidation: 6-Drug Combination
      Chemotherapy with Leucovorin Rescue plus TIT. ARA-C; VP-16; Asparaginase (E. coli), ASP,
      NSC-109229; MTX; VCR; Methylprednisolone, MePRDL, NSC-19987; with CF; plus TIT. Reinduction:
      7-Drug Combination Chemotherapy with Leucovorin Rescue plus TIT. CTX; TSPA; VCR; DNR; DM;
      VP-16; MTX; with CF; plus TIT.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients, accrued from 4 institutions, will be entered.
      If at any time more than 3 patients are not "event free", the trial will be terminated
      early, with patients considered event free if they enter remission, do not die as a result
      of treatment toxicity, and do not experience progression within 1 year from the start of
      therapy.
