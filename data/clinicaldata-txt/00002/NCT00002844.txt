TITLE:
Bone Marrow Transplantation in Treating Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia

CONDITION:
Leukemia

INTERVENTION:
Cyclophosphamide

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with bone marrow transplantation may
      allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bone marrow transplantation in
      treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: Examine the potential role for high dose cyclophosphamide, total body
      irradiation and bone marrow transplantation for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia
      who are at high risk for disease progression.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive daily intravenous infusions of cyclophosphamide for two days,
      followed by total body irradiation in four daily exposures. After completion of the total
      body irradiation, allogeneic or autologous bone marrow is infused intravenously.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 50 patients are expected to be accrued.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 16 Years to 65 Years
Criteria:

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients after initial relapse
        who have achieved a complete or partial remission with fludarabine therapy or after
        initial relapse or progression Prolymphocytic leukemia in first remission or after relapse
        Patients 15-65 years old who lack an HLA-identical sibling are eligible for autologous BM
        transplantation Patients 16-50 years old with an HLA identical or one antigen mismatched
        related donor are eligible for allogeneic BM transplantation

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: 15-65 (See Disease Characteristics) Performance status:
        Zubrod no more than 2 Hematopoietic: Not specified Hepatic: Bilirubin no greater than 1.5
        mg/dL Renal: Creatinine no greater than 1.5 mg/dL Cardiovascular: Cardiac ejection
        fraction at least 50% Pulmonary: DLCO at least 50% of predicted Other: No severe
        concomitant medical or psychiatric illnesses

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: No extensive prior radiotherapy which would prevent
        administration of total body radiation Patients may also participate in study MDA-DM-92082
        for retroviral gene marking of the autologous marrow and blood cells
