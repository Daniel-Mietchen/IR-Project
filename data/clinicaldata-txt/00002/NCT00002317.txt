TITLE:
A Study of Trimetrexate Plus Leucovorin in Children With Pneumocystis Carinii Pneumonia

CONDITION:
Pneumonia, Pneumocystis Carinii

INTERVENTION:
Trimetrexate glucuronate

SUMMARY:

      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of trimetrexate glucuronate with leucovorin protection
      in pediatric patients with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) who are refractory to or
      have demonstrated severe or life-threatening toxicities to standard therapies (e.g., TMP/SMX
      or parenteral pentamidine).
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Patients receive intravenous infusions of trimetrexate glucuronate and leucovorin for 21
      days. Leucovorin is continued for 3 additional days after discontinuation of trimetrexate
      glucuronate. Patients are followed for 1 month.
