TITLE:
A Phase I/II Study of Intralesional Recombinant Tumor Necrosis Factor in Patients With AIDS-Related Cutaneous Kaposi's Sarcoma

CONDITION:
Sarcoma, Kaposi

INTERVENTION:
Tumor Necrosis Factor

SUMMARY:

      To evaluate tolerance, toxicity, and preliminary evidence of antitumor efficacy of
      intralesionally administered tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and to define a maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) for single intralesional injections. In addition, to assess the effects of TNF
      injections on Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) lesions as measured by P-32 magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy.
