TITLE:
Phase III Multicenter, Open-Label, Randomized Trial of Induction Versus Induction Plus Maintenance Foscarnet ( Foscavir ) Therapy for Gastrointestinal CMV Disease

CONDITION:
HIV Infections

INTERVENTION:
Foscarnet sodium

SUMMARY:

      PRIMARY: To compare the frequency of and time to relapse of Cytomegalovirus (CMV)
      gastrointestinal disease following foscarnet induction therapy only versus induction plus
      maintenance therapy.

      SECONDARY: To determine frequency of and time to recurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms,
      response rate of pathological lesions, and incidence of nongastrointestinal CMV disease in
      this patient population.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Patients receive intravenous foscarnet either as induction only for 4 weeks or as induction
      for 4 weeks followed by maintenance for 22 weeks. All patients are followed for 26 weeks or
      until relapse.
