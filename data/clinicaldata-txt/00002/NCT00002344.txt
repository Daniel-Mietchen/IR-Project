TITLE:
A Study of Azithromycin in HIV-Infected Patients

CONDITION:
Bacterial Infections

INTERVENTION:
Azithromycin

SUMMARY:

      To assess the dose proportionality of azithromycin concentrations and toleration when
      delivered in tablet formulation to HIV-infected patients.

      The need exists to further assess the antibacterial agent azithromycin at differing doses in
      an HIV-infected population.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      The need exists to further assess the antibacterial agent azithromycin at differing doses in
      an HIV-infected population.

      Patients are randomized to receive azithromycin at 1 of 2 doses in a two-treatment,
      two-period, cross-over study. Dosing visits are separated by at least 14-day wash-out
      periods.
