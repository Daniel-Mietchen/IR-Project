TITLE:
Epirubicin and Cyclophosphamide Compared With Epirubicin and Paclitaxel in Treating Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer

CONDITION:
Breast Cancer

INTERVENTION:
cyclophosphamide

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of epirubicin and
      cyclophosphamide with epirubicin and paclitaxel in treating women with metastatic breast
      cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the activity and toxicity of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide with
      that of epirubicin and paclitaxel in patients with metastatic breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to receive either epirubicin and cyclophosphamide or
      epirubicin and paclitaxel. Each drug combination is given every 3 weeks for 6 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 704 patients will be accrued for this study.
