TITLE:
A Phase I Study of Subcutaneously Administered Proleukin (Aldesleukin) in HIV-Infected Patients

CONDITION:
HIV Infections

INTERVENTION:
Aldesleukin

SUMMARY:

      To determine the MTD and dose-limiting toxicities of recombinant interleukin-2 (aldesleukin;
      Proleukin) administered subcutaneously in HIV-seropositive patients. To identify a tolerable
      subcutaneous regimen that will replicate the immunologic improvement demonstrated in the
      outpatient polyethylene glycolated IL-2 and high-dose continuous infusion IL-2 studies. To
      evaluate the incidence and level of anti-IL-2 antibody formation to subcutaneously
      administered Proleukin in this patient population.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Patients will receive subcutaneous Proleukin, and the MTD will be determined.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 18 Years to N/A
Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Documented HIV infection by ELISA and Western blot.

          -  CD4 count > 200 cells/mm3.

        Required:
