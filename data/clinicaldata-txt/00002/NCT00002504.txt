TITLE:
Interleukin-2 Plus Interferon Alfa in Treating Adults With Metastatic Cancer

CONDITION:
Chronic Myeloproliferative Disorders

INTERVENTION:
aldesleukin

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill metastatic
      cancer cells. Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of the cancer cells. Combining
      interleukin-2 and interferon alfa may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of interleukin-2 plus interferon alfa in
      treating adults with metastatic cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate, failure-free survival, and overall survival of
      interleukin-2 and interferon alpha administered subcutaneously on an outpatient basis for 8
      weeks to patients with metastatic cancer. II. Determine the toxicities associated with this
      therapy.

      OUTLINE: Biological Response Modifier Therapy. Interleukin-2 (Cetus), IL-2, NSC-373364;
      Interferon alpha (Schering), IFN-A, NSC-377523.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 30 patients with various malignancies will be entered.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 18 Years to N/A
Criteria:

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed metastatic cancer of any type Measurable
        or evaluable disease required, i.e.: Bidimensionally measurable lesions on physical exam,
        x-ray, CT, MRI, or other radiologic procedure Any lesion apparent on radiologic exam that
        is not measurable in 2 perpendicular diameters Previously irradiated lesions acceptable
        provided subsequent progression is documented No active brain metastases Previously
        treated brain metastases allowed provided measurable/evaluable disease exists outside the
        CNS
