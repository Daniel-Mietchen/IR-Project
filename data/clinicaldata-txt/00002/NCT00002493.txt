TITLE:
Radiation Therapy Compared With Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Advanced Endometrial Cancer

CONDITION:
Endometrial Cancer

INTERVENTION:
cisplatin

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. It is not yet known which treatment regimen is more effective for endometrial cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare radiation therapy with chemotherapy in
      treating patients who have advanced endometrial cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare overall survival, progression-free interval, and patterns of failure
      of maximally debulked patients with stage III/IV endometrial carcinoma treated with
      whole-abdominal irradiation vs. doxorubicin/cisplatin. II. Compare the incidence and type of
      acute and late adverse events observed with these two treatment regimens. III. Compare
      changes in fatigue, elimination, and neurologic impairment that impact on quality of life in
      patients treated with these two regimens. IV. Assess the difference in short-term versus
      long-term impact on quality of life between the two treatment groups. V. Compare
      quality-of-life outcomes over time between these two treatment groups.

      OUTLINE: Randomized study. Arm I: Radiotherapy. Whole-abdominal irradiation using equipment
      with photon energies ranging from 6 to 25 MV. Arm II: 2-Drug Combination Chemotherapy.
      Doxorubicin, DOX, NSC-123127; Cisplatin, CDDP, NSC-119875.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: It is anticipated that 355 patients will be entered over 7.4 years.
