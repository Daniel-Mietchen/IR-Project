TITLE:
Safety and Effectiveness of Giving Indinavir, Ritonavir, Stavudine, and Lamivudine to HIV-Infected Patients Who Have Never Received Anti-HIV Drugs

CONDITION:
HIV Infections

INTERVENTION:
Indinavir sulfate

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe to give indinavir (IDV) and ritonavir
      (RTV) in combination with stavudine (d4T) and lamivudine (3TC) to HIV-positive patients who
      have never received anti-HIV therapy. This study will look at the effectiveness of this drug
      combination and side effects.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Patients entering this study initiate antiretroviral therapy. For 24 weeks patients receive
      daily dosages of IDV, RTV, 3TC, and d4T. Patients are seen at Day 1 and at Weeks 2, 4, 8,
      12, 16, 20, and 24 for physical examinations, pregnancy testing, and blood sampling to
      monitor CD4 count and viral load. On Day 14, blood is drawn frequently for 24 hours for IDV
      and RTV pharmacokinetic sampling. The incidence of serious and drug-related adverse events
      and of adverse events leading to study discontinuation is tabulated.
