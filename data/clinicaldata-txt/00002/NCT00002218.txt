TITLE:
A Phase I Maximum Tolerated Dose Study of CI-1012 in Late-Stage HIV+ Patients

CONDITION:
HIV Infections

INTERVENTION:
CI-1012

SUMMARY:

      To determine the maximum tolerated dose of CI-1012 in late-stage HIV-1-infected patients. To
      determine the antiretroviral activity of CI-1012 when added to combination therapy. To
      assess the multiple-dose pharmacokinetic characteristics of CT-1012 when added to
      combination therapy. To assess the effect of CI-1012 on the pharmacokinetics of other
      antiretroviral agents.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Doses are escalated based on safety assessments: As soon as a dose meets the criteria for
      "tolerated" or "not tolerated", doses are escalated or terminated, respectively. All
      patients are treated for 2 weeks, with follow-up visits scheduled 1 week and 1 month
      post-treatment.
