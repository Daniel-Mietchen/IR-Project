TITLE:
A Study of Isoprinosine in Patients With Lymph Node Disease

CONDITION:
Lymphatic Disease

INTERVENTION:
Inosine pranobex

SUMMARY:

      The objectives of this study are to determine the effects of isoprinosine in patients
      diagnosed as having unexplained generalized lymphadenopathy. Variables to be examined will
      include:

      Signs and symptoms:

        -  Lymphadenopathy.

        -  Fever.

        -  Weight loss.

        -  Occurrence of opportunistic infections.

      Cell-mediated immune system parameters:

        -  T-helper cell (OKT4) numbers and proportions.

        -  T-suppressor cell (OKT8) numbers and proportions.

        -  Natural killer (NK) cell activity.

        -  Lymphocyte blastogenic response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA).

        -  Lymphocyte blastogenic response to pokeweed mitogen (PWM).

        -  Immunoglobulin (IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE, IgD) profile.

        -  Circulating immune complexes. Infections characteristically associated with AIDS, such
           as Candida albicans, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, Cytomegalovirus, Herpes simplex,
           Cryptococcus, Histoplasma, Toxoplasma, Cryptosporidium, Mycobacterium avium-
           intracellulare, Legionella, and Isospora.

      Safety parameters:

        -  Blood chemistry including serum uric acid (PurposeA-12).

        -  Complete blood count (CBC).

        -  Platelet count.
