TITLE:
Monoclonal Antibody Therapy in Treating Children With Metastatic Neuroblastoma in Second Remission

CONDITION:
Neuroblastoma

INTERVENTION:
monoclonal antibody 3F8

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver
      tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody in treating
      children with metastatic neuroblastoma in second remission.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy of ganglioside GD2-specific monoclonal antibody 3F8 as
      adjuvant therapy in patients with Stage IV neuroblastoma in second remission.

      OUTLINE: Biological Response Modifier Therapy. Antiganglioside GD2-specific Monoclonal
      Antibody 3F8, MOAB 3F8.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 20 patients will be entered.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: N/A to 18 Years
Criteria:

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed, Stage IV neuroblastoma in second or
        subsequent complete remission, defined by the complete disappearance of all evidence of
        tumor on the following: Physical examination Second-look surgery Bone scan Bone marrow
        aspiration and biopsy Chest x-ray CT MIBG Urinary catecholamines If marrow is infiltrated
        by tumor, complete elimination of tumor cells from the marrow compartment must be
        demonstrated by histology and immunofluorescence (based on simultaneous bone marrow
        aspiration and biopsy samples from at least 4 separate sites)

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: Under 18 Performance status: Not specified Life expectancy:
        Greater than 12 weeks Hematopoietic: Grade 4 cytopenias allowed Grade 3 marrow hypoplasia
        allowed Hepatic: Not specified Renal: No renal dysfunction worse than grade 3
        Cardiovascular: No cardiac dysfunction worse than grade 2 Pulmonary: No pulmonary
        dysfunction worse than grade 2 Other: No neurologic dysfunction worse than grade 2 Hearing
        deficit allowed

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Prior murine antibody therapy allowed provided circulating HAMA
        titer is less than 1,000 U/mL serum by ELISA
