TITLE:
Radiation Therapy and Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Head and Neck Cancer

CONDITION:
Carcinoma of Unknown Primary

INTERVENTION:
mitomycin C

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. It is not yet known whether combining mitomycin or porfiromycin with radiation therapy
      is more effective in treating patients with head and neck cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of radiation therapy plus
      either mitomycin or porfiromycin in treating patients with head and neck cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the efficacy of mitomycin vs. porfiromycin as an adjunct to
      radiotherapy for the treatment of epidermoid carcinomas of the head and neck.

      OUTLINE: Randomized study. Arm I: Radiotherapy plus Single-Agent Chemotherapy. Irradiation
      of involved head and neck sites by external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) alone (source not
      specified), brachytherapy alone (using permanent or removable radiation sources), or both;
      plus Mitomycin, MITO, NSC-26980. Arm II: Radiotherapy plus Single-Agent Chemotherapy.
      Radiotherapy as in Arm I; plus Porfiromycin, NSC-56410.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 200 patients will be entered over 3-4 years.

        other serious, life-threatening illness No second malignancy within 5 years except
        nonmelanomatous skin cancer outside the planned radiotherapy field

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: At least 3 years since chemotherapy No prior radiotherapy to
        areas of current disease
