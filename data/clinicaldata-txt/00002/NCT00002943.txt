TITLE:
Carboplatin, Etoposide, Cyclophosphamide, and Autologous Bone Marrow Transplantation in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Cancer

CONDITION:
Extragonadal Germ Cell Tumor

INTERVENTION:
carboplatin

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with autologous bone marrow
      transplantation may help the body kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effects of high doses of carboplatin, etoposide, and
      cyclophosphamide followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation in patients with
      relapsed or refractory germ cell cancer and other chemotherapy-sensitive solid tumors.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Investigate the response rate, duration of response, survival, time to marrow
           reconstitution, and toxicity of two successive cycles of high dose carboplatin,
           etoposide, and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy and ABMT in patients with relapsed and
           refractory germ cell cancer or other chemotherapy-sensitive solid tumors.

        -  Further define the pretransplant characteristics of patients and their disease that
           might influence the outcome of this therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive carboplatin and etoposide for 5 days and cyclophosphamide for 2
      days prior to ABMT.

      At day 60 following ABMT, if the patient has a complete response (CR) or partial response
      (PR) and nonhematologic toxicity is no greater than grade 2, a second ABMT course is given
      when hematologic parameters and other criteria are acceptable. If there is no CR or PR
      and/or nonhematologic toxicity exceeds grade 2, a second ABMT is not given.

      After ABMT patients are followed until disease progression or death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Ten patients will be accrued for this pilot study.
