TITLE:
Monoclonal Antibody Plus Cyclophosphamide in Treating Patients With Metastatic Cancer

CONDITION:
Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific

INTERVENTION:
antibody therapy

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver
      tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody and
      cyclophosphamide in treating patients with metastatic cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the clinical feasibility and toxicity of monoclonal antibody OKT3
      given with low-dose cyclophosphamide in patients with advanced malignancies. II. Perform
      serial immune monitoring on patients treated with this regimen. III. Identify any clinical
      responses produced by this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Biological Response Modifier Therapy with Suppressor Cell Inhibition. Anti-CD3
      Murine Monoclonal Antibody OKT3, MOAB OKT3; with Cyclophosphamide, CTX, NSC-26271.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 9 evaluable patients per diagnostic category will be required
      initially; if any response is seen during the dose-finding portion of the study, a total of
      24 patients with that diagnosis will be entered.
