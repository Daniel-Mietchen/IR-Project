TITLE:
A Study to Find the Best Dosing Schedule for Delavirdine, Zidovudine, and Indinavir in HIV-Positive Patients

CONDITION:
HIV Infections

INTERVENTION:

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to see whether it is better to take delavirdine (DLV) plus
      indinavir (IDV) plus zidovudine (ZDV) twice a day or three times a day.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Patients are divided into 2 treatment groups; the groups are balanced with respect to viral
      load. Group A receives ZDV, DLV, and IDV 3 times daily. Group B receives ZDV, DLV, and IDV 2
      times daily. Patients are evaluated for changes from baseline in viral load and CD4 cell
      count.
