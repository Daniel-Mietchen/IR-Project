TITLE:
SWOG-9133 RT w/ or w/o Doxorubicin and Vinblastine in Stage I or Stage II Hodgkin's Disease

CONDITION:
Lymphoma

INTERVENTION:
doxorubicin hydrochloride

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more
      tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of radiation therapy with
      or without doxorubicin and vinblastine in treating patients with stage I or stage II
      Hodgkin's disease.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare progression-free and overall survival of patients with clinical Stage
      IA/IIA Hodgkin's disease who have not undergone laparotomy and who are randomized to
      treatment with subtotal nodal irradiation with vs. without 3 courses of
      doxorubicin/vinblastine. II. Compare the long-term toxicities associated with these
      treatments, including cardiopulmonary toxicity, secondary malignancies, and infertility.
      III. Identify subgroups of patients (based on age, gender, tumor histology, number of
      disease sites, and presence of high neck presentation) that are particularly responsive to
      these treatments.

      OUTLINE: Randomized study. Arm I: Radiotherapy. Subtotal nodal irradiation using megavoltage
      equipment (4-10 MeV). Arm II: 2-Drug Combination Chemotherapy followed by Radiotherapy.
      Doxorubicin, DOX, NSC-123127; Vinblastine, VBL, NSC-49842; followed by subtotal nodal
      irradiation as in Arm I.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 210 patients/arm will be enrolled over about 7 years.
