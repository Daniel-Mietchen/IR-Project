TITLE:
A Phase IIIB Open-Label, Comparative Study to Evaluate Saquinavir Soft Gel Capsule (SGC) Treatment in Combination With Other Antiretrovirals in HIV-1 Infected Antiretroviral-Naive Patients

CONDITION:
HIV Infections

INTERVENTION:
Ritonavir

SUMMARY:

      To determine the proportion of patients whose plasma HIV-1 RNA level falls below the level
      of detection (< 400 copies/ml) at week 16 and 24 of study therapy. To determine the absolute
      change in plasma HIV-1 RNA and in absolute CD4 cell count during the 24 weeks of study
      treatment. To collect safety data on the treatment regimens. To determine the percentage of
      patients without SQV soft gel capsules resistance-associated mutations at week 24.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Patients are randomized to receive 1 of 3 study regimens: Group A - Saquinavir (SQV) soft
      gel capsules (sgc) plus 2 reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs), Group B - SQV sgc plus
      delavirdine plus RTI, and Group C - SQV sgc plus nelfinavir plus RTI (or SQV sgc plus
      ritonavir plus 2 RTIs).
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 16 Years to N/A
Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria
