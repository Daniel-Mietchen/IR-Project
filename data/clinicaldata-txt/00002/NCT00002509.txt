TITLE:
High-Dose Combination Chemotherapy Followed by Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation in Treating Patients With Poor-Prognosis Breast Cancer

CONDITION:
Breast Cancer

INTERVENTION:
filgrastim

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining peripheral stem cell transplantation with
      combinations of drugs may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of high-dose combination chemotherapy
      followed by peripheral stem cell transplantation or autologous bone marrow transplantation
      in women with stage II breast cancer with eight or more positive axillary lymph nodes and in
      women with stage III or metastatic breast cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Investigate the curative potential of high-dose cyclophosphamide, etoposide,
      and carboplatin followed by autologous stem cell rescue in women with breast cancer
      considered incurable by conventional therapy. II. Observe the overall response rate,
      survival rate, and toxicity associated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Prior to therapy, patients undergo collection of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC)
      on another protocol; patients with marrow involvement undergo PBSC harvest only, while all
      others may also undergo bone marrow harvest. All patients receive cyclophosphamide,
      etoposide, and carboplatin over 4 consecutive days, followed 3 days later by PBSC or bone
      marrow and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Patients are followed for duration of
      remission and survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 100-200 patients will be entered.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: Female
Age: 15 Years to 60 Years
Criteria:

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed invasive (stage II-IV) carcinoma of the
        breast 8 or more positive axillary nodes required for stage II disease
        Chemotherapy-responsive disease required of patients with measurable or evaluable disease
        Partial or complete response to 3 courses of standard
        cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/fluorouracil (CAF) or, for patients who have had CAF,
        cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/fluorouracil (CMF) 3-month course of standard
        mitomycin/vinblastine or paclitaxel acceptable in patients clearly resistant to CAF or CMF
        Visceral response despite progression in bone will be considered on an individual basis
        Patients with no evidence of disease may be entered without evidence of a chemotherapy
        response Resectable disease must be surgically removed prior to transplantation Hormone
        receptor status: If estrogen-receptor positive, prior failure with at least 1 hormonal
        manipulation required unless patient is premenopausal or has rapidly progressing visceral
        disease No more than 20% of marrow involved with tumor
