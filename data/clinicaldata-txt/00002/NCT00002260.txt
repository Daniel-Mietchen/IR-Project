TITLE:
An Open-Label, Crossover Study to Assess the Effect of Food on the Oral Bioavailability and Pharmacokinetic Profile of 3'-Deoxy-3'-Fluorothymidine (FLT) in Asymptomatic Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-Infected Subjects

CONDITION:
HIV Infections

INTERVENTION:
Alovudine

SUMMARY:

      To characterize the pharmacokinetics of orally administered FLT (in a liquid formulation)
      after single doses in both the fed and fasting states; to assess the effect of food on the
      oral bioavailability of FLT
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
NONE

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 18 Years to N/A
