TITLE:
A Study to Compare Two Anti-HIV Drug Combinations

CONDITION:
HIV Infections

INTERVENTION:
Ritonavir

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to compare 2 anti-HIV drug combinations.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Patients are stratified by HIV RNA: 5,000-75,000 vs greater than 75,000 copies/ml by
      Amplicor assay. Patients are randomized to two arms. Arm A receives SQV plus RTV plus two
      NRTIs. Arm B receives EFV plus two NRTIs. Patients must take their dose at approximately the
      same time every day. Patients have the option of taking daily dose in AM or PM. Patients are
      evaluated for changes in plasma HIV RNA levels and CD4/CD8 counts and for adverse
      experiences and laboratory determinations. Evaluations are made every 4-8 weeks until Week
      48. Patients continuing beyond Week 48 who reach Weeks 60, 72, 84, and common study closure,
      will be seen at those weeks.
