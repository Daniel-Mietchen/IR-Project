TITLE:
Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Older Patients With Intermediate- or High-Grade Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma

CONDITION:
Lymphoma

INTERVENTION:
cyclophosphamide

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy
      consisting of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone, with either mitoxantrone or
      doxorubicin in treating patients with intermediate- or high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the treatment-related neurologic and hematologic toxicities of
      patients aged 65 years and over with intermediate- or high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
      randomized to CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone) vs. MCOP
      (mitoxantrone, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisolone). II. Compare the survival rate
      in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Randomized study. The following acronyms are used: CHOP CTX/DOX/VCR/PRDL CTX
      Cyclophosphamide, NSC-26271 DHAD Mitoxantrone, NSC-301739 DOX Doxorubicin, NSC-123127 MCOP
      DHAD/CTX/VCR/PRDL PRDL Prednisolone, NSC-9900 VCR Vincristine, NSC-67574 Arm I: 4-Drug
      Combination Chemotherapy. CHOP. Arm II: 4-Drug Combination Chemotherapy. MCOP.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients will be entered over approximately 5 years.
