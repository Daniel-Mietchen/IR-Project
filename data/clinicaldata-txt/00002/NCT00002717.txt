TITLE:
Paclitaxel and Cisplatin in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Ovarian Cancer or Primary Peritoneal Cancer

CONDITION:
Ovarian Cancer

INTERVENTION:
cisplatin

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is
      not yet known which chemotherapy regimen is more effective for ovarian or peritoneal cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of two regimens of
      paclitaxel plus cisplatin in treating patients who have residual disease after surgery to
      remove stage III or stage IV ovarian cancer or primary peritoneal cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare progression free and overall survival and frequency of response in
      patients with suboptimal stage III or IV ovarian epithelial cancer or primary peritoneal
      cancer treated with a 24 hour vs 96 hour infusion of paclitaxel (TAX) followed by cisplatin.
      II. Determine the incidence and severity of adverse events, including catheter complications
      and drug toxicity, for the 96 hour infusion of TAX. III. Compare the relationship between
      plasma TAX concentrations, toxicity, and response to both infusion schedules in this patient
      population.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center and measurable disease (yes vs no). Patients are randomized into one of
      two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV continuously over 24 hours
      followed by cisplatin IV over 2 hours. Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV continuously
      over 96 hours followed by cisplatin IV over 2 hours. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 6
      courses.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 324 patients will be accrued for this study over 4.5 years.
