TITLE:
A Phase I Study of the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Recombinant CD4 (rCD4) in Patients With AIDS and AIDS-Related Complex

CONDITION:
HIV Infections

INTERVENTION:
CD4 Antigens

SUMMARY:

      To determine the safety profile and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of recombinant soluble
      human CD4 (rCD4) therapy in patients with AIDS or AIDS related complex (ARC). To assess
      pharmacokinetic properties of rCD4 in humans. To obtain a preliminary indication of the
      antiviral effects of rCD4 in patients with AIDS and AIDS related complex (ARC).
