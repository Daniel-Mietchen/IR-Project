TITLE:
Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Advanced Head and Neck Cancer

CONDITION:
Head and Neck Cancer

INTERVENTION:
paclitaxel

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of paclitaxel in treating patients with
      recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the response rate and toxic effects of paclitaxel by 96 hour
      continuous infusion in chemotherapy naive and chemotherapy exposed patients with recurrent
      or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel as a 96 hour continuous IV infusion. Courses repeat
      every 3 weeks for a maximum of 12 courses. Patients with disease progression after 2 courses
      or with unacceptable toxicity at any time are removed from study.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 109 patients will be accrued for this study over 4 years.
    

ELIGIBILITY:

        neck (including nasopharynx) that is considered incurable with surgery or radiation
        therapy Bidimensionally measurable disease Patients whose only site of measurable disease
        is within a previous radiation port must have documented progressive disease or
        biopsy-proven recurrence after the completion of radiotherapy No uncontrolled CNS
        metastases

        monoclonal antibodies allowed Recovered from prior therapy Chemotherapy: Prior paclitaxel
        infusion no greater than 24 hours for recurrent or metastatic disease required Endocrine
