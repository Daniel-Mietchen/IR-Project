TITLE:
Evaluation of an Anti-HIV Drug Combination That Includes a Coated Form of Didanosine (ddI EC) Compared to a Typical Anti-HIV Drug Regimen

CONDITION:
HIV Infections

INTERVENTION:
Lamivudine/Zidovudine

SUMMARY:

      This study tests a new form of didanosine, ddI EC, a coated pill that passes through the
      stomach before dissolving. The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of an
      anti-HIV drug combination that includes ddI EC versus another anti-HIV drug combination.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups for 48 weeks of open-label treatment. Group 1
      receives ddI EC plus d4T plus NFV. Group 2 receives Combivir plus NFV. Antiviral activity is
      determined by the proportion of patients with HIV RNA levels of less than 400 copies/ml at
      Week 48.
