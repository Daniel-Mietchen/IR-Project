TITLE:
Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Liver Metastases From Colorectal Cancer

CONDITION:
Colorectal Cancer

INTERVENTION:
dexamethasone

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells. It is
      not yet known which chemotherapy regimen is more effective for metastatic colorectal cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of intrahepatic
      floxuridine, leucovorin, and dexamethasone with that of systemic fluorouracil and leucovorin
      in treating patients who have unresectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the efficacy, toxicity, and cost of hepatic artery infusion of floxuridine,
           leucovorin calcium (CF), and dexamethasone vs IV fluorouracil and IV CF after resection
           of primary disease in patients with hepatic metastases secondary to colorectal cancer.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Measure the level of thymidylate synthase present in liver metastases, and correlate
           these levels with objective response and survival in patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Assess the p53 mutations, and correlate findings with objective response and survival
           in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      center, percentage of liver involvement on CT scan or MRI (less than 30% vs 30% to under
      70%), prior chemotherapy (none vs adjuvant chemotherapy comprising fluorouracil (5-FU) and
      leucovorin calcium (CF) or 5-FU, CF, and levamisole (LEV) completed at least 1 year before
      study vs adjuvant chemotherapy comprising 5-FU with or without LEV completed at least 6
      months before study), and synchronous disease (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

                    -  Suspicious lesion on barium enema, colonoscopy, or sigmoidoscopy, and a
                       liver biopsy positive for adenocarcinoma consistent with the primary
                       colorectal tumor

          -  Measurable disease

               -  Clearly defined liver mass measuring at least 2 cm or at least 3 liver masses on
                  CT scan or MRI

          -  No evidence of extrahepatic disease on CT scan and physical exam

          -  Fertile patients must use effective contraception

        Chemotherapy:

          -  At least 1 year since prior adjuvant chemotherapy comprising fluorouracil (5-FU) and
