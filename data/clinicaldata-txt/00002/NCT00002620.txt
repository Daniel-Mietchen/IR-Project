TITLE:
Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Brain Cancer

CONDITION:
Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors

INTERVENTION:
carmustine

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells and may be an
      effective treatment for patients with anaplastic astrocytomas.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to study the effectiveness of radiation therapy in
      treating patients with anaplastic astrocytomas.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the disease-free interval and survival in patients with
      supratentorial malignant brain gliomas randomized to radiotherapy alone vs. radiotherapy
      plus radiosensitization with mitolactol (DBD) followed by DBD and carmustine.

      OUTLINE: Randomized study. Group I: Radiotherapy. External-beam cranial irradiation with
      megavoltage equipment. Group II: Radiotherapy with Radiosensitization followed by
      Maintenance Chemotherapy. Radiotherapy as in Group I; with Mitolactol, DBD, NSC-104800;
      followed by DBD; Carmustine, BCNU, NSC-409962.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 212 patients will be entered over more than 3 years.
