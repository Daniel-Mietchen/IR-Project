TITLE:
A Pilot Study of OPC-8212 (Vesnarinone) in Persons With AIDS-Related Kaposi's Sarcoma

CONDITION:
Sarcoma, Kaposi

INTERVENTION:
Vesnarinone

SUMMARY:

      To examine the safety and efficacy of two doses of vesnarinone in patients with AIDS-related
      Kaposi's sarcoma.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Twenty-eight patients (14 per cohort) receive daily vesnarinone at one of two doses. At
      least seven patients at the lower dose must have completed 2 weeks of therapy before
      subsequent patients are entered at the higher dose. Patients who successfully complete 16
      weeks of treatment may receive maintenance therapy for the duration of the study
      (approximately 12-18 months).
