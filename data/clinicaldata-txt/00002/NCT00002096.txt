TITLE:
A Phase I Pharmacokinetic Study in HIV-Positive Subjects of Oral Ganciclovir and Concomitant Antiretroviral Zidovudine and Didanosine

CONDITION:
Cytomegalovirus Infections

INTERVENTION:
Zidovudine

SUMMARY:

      To determine whether there is a pharmacokinetic drug interaction between oral ganciclovir
      and oral zidovudine (AZT) and between oral ganciclovir and oral didanosine (ddI). To
      determine whether concurrent administration of probenecid affects the pharmacokinetics of
      oral ganciclovir. To obtain data on the short-term safety of oral ganciclovir administered
      concurrently with AZT, ddI, or probenecid in HIV-positive patients.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Patients currently on either AZT or ddI receive ganciclovir therapy.
