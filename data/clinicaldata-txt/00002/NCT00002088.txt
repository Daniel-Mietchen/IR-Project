        Inclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication:

        Patients must have:

          -  Documented HIV infection.

          -  Chronic diarrhea (for at least 1 month) that is either a manifestation or

          -  Had a stool culture (Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, and Clostridium difficile)
             and stool analysis for ova and parasite (O/P X 3) within the past 2 months.

          -  Failed antimicrobial treatment for diarrhea OR received no prior antimicrobials for
             stool pathogens because stool cultures were negative.

        Patients who are on antiviral medications for HIV infection must have received such
        medication for at least 2 weeks and must remain on stable dose for weeks 1 and 2 of study.

        Prior Medication:
