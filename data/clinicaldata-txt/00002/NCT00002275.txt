TITLE:
A Comparison of Two Types of Injected Nutritional Supplements in Patients With AIDS and Pneumocystis Carinii Pneumonia (PCP)

CONDITION:
HIV Infections

INTERVENTION:
Fat Emulsion 2%

SUMMARY:

      The objectives of this study are:

      To establish whether there is a difference in clinical effectiveness of Liposyn II 20
      percent as compared with Liposyn III 2 percent in AIDS patients with Pneumocystis carinii
      pneumonia (PCP). To compare the effects of the two lipid emulsions on immunologic function
      in AIDS patients. To compare the effect of the two lipid emulsions on HIV load in AIDS
      patients as measured by reverse transcriptase (RT) in culture. To determine whether a
      decrease in HIV infectivity is greater in patients given a parenteral feeding regimen
      containing Liposyn II 20 percent or Liposyn III 2 percent.
