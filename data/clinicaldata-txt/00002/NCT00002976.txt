TITLE:
Estrogen Replacement Therapy in Treating Women With Early-Stage Endometrial Cancer

CONDITION:
Endometrial Cancer

INTERVENTION:
conjugated estrogens

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Estrogen replacement therapy may improve quality-of-life in postmenopausal women
      with endometrial cancer. It is not yet known whether estrogen replacement therapy will
      affect cancer recurrence.

      PURPOSE: Randomized double-blinded phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of
      estrogen replacement therapy in treating women who have stage I or stage II endometrial
      cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the effect of estrogen replacement therapy on recurrence free and overall
           survival in women with a history of stage I or II endometrial adenocarcinoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind study. Patients are stratified according to
      stage of endometrial cancer (IA vs IB/IC vs II). Patients are randomized to one of two
      treatment arms:

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral conjugated estrogens (Premarin) daily for 3 years.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo daily for 3 years. Patients are followed every 6
           months for 3 years and then annually for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 2,108 patients will be accrued for this study.
