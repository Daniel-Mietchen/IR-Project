TITLE:
Laparoscopic Staging in Patients With Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Other Primary Abdominal Cancers

CONDITION:
Fallopian Tube Cancer

INTERVENTION:
laparoscopic surgery

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Laparoscopic staging may help doctors plan more effective treatment for ovarian,
      primary fallopian tube, and primary abdominal cancers.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of laparoscopic staging in patients with
      ovarian, primary fallopian tube, or primary abdominal cancers who have not undergone
      complete staging.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the feasibility of laparoscopic staging of patients with
      incompletely staged ovarian, primary fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers. II.
      Assess the adverse effects associated with this technique.

      OUTLINE: Surgery. Laparoscopy with cytologic examination and lymph node sampling followed,
      if feasible, by surgical resection.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 50 patients will be accrued over approximately 2 years. If more
      than 4 evaluable patients cannot complete surgery, the study will be closed.
