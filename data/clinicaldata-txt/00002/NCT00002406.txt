TITLE:
A Comparison of Two Dose Levels of Indinavir Combined With Two Nucleoside Analogue Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) in HIV-Infected Patients

CONDITION:
HIV Infections

INTERVENTION:
Indinavir sulfate

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to determine if two dose levels of indinavir combined with two
      nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) have the same effect on plasma
      viral load (level of HIV in the blood).
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      In this open-label study 350 seropositive HIV-1 men and women are first stratified according
      to baseline plasma viral RNA (less than 400 copies/mL vs negative plasma viral RNA result)
      then randomized into one of two arms:

      Arm 1: Indinavir (800 mg, q8h) plus two pre-existing NRTIs. Arm 2: Indinavir (1,200 mg,
      q12h) plus two pre-existing NRTIs. Plasma viral RNA will be measured every 4 weeks for the
      duration of the 24-week study.

Age: 16 Years to N/A
