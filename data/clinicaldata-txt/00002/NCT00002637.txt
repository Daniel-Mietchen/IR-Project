TITLE:
Biological Therapy in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer

CONDITION:
Prostate Cancer

INTERVENTION:
aldesleukin

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells including natural killer
      cells to kill prostate cancer cells. Interferon gamma may interfere with the growth of the
      cancer cells. Combining interferon gamma with interleukin-2 may be a more effective
      treatment for prostate cancer.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of biological therapy using
      interleukin-2 and interferon gamma in treating patients with advanced prostate cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the safety of immunization with HLA class I-matched allogeneic human
      prostate carcinoma cells genetically engineered to secrete interleukin-2 and interferon
      gamma in patients with prostate carcinoma. II. Evaluate the antitumor effects of this
      treatment as assessed by post-therapy declines in PSA. III. Evaluate the induction of
      cellular and humoral immunity in vivo with this treatment.

      OUTLINE: Tumor Cell Vaccine Therapy. Immunization with irradiated, MHC class I-matched
      allogeneic human prostate carcinoma cells, LNCaP cells, engineered to secrete approximately
      58 ng/24 hr/million cells of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and approximately 0.72 U/24 hr/million
      cells of interferon gamma (IFN-G).

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 12 patients will be entered on the Phase I study; accrual will
      continue to a total of 25 patients treated at the MTD (Phase II). Accrual is expected to
      require 2 years.
