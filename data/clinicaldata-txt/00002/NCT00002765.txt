TITLE:
Immunotoxin in Treating Patients With Leukemia or Lymphoma

CONDITION:
Leukemia

INTERVENTION:
LMB-2 immunotoxin

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Immunotoxins can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver
      cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of LMB-2 immunotoxin in treating patients
      who have leukemia or lymphoma.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Assess the therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of the recombinant immunotoxin LMB-2, an
           anti-Tac murine monoclonal antibody fragment conjugated to a truncated portion of
           Pseudomonas exotoxin, in patients with Tac-expressing leukemias and lymphomas.

        -  Define the pharmacokinetics of LMB-2, including the terminal elimination serum
           half-life, area under the curve, and volume of distribution.

        -  Evaluate, in a preliminary manner, the immunogenicity of LMB-2 in these patients.

        -  Determine the effect of LMB-2 on various components of the circulating cellular immune
           system.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients receive LMB-2 immunotoxin IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment repeats
      every 15-21 days for up to 10 courses in the absence of disease progression, neutralizing
      antibodies, or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients each receive escalating doses of LMB-2 immunotoxin until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which no more than 1
      patient experiences dose limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
