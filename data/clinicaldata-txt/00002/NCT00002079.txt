TITLE:
Phase II Study of the Safety and Surrogate Marker Efficacy of Butyldeoxynojirimycin (SC-48334) and AZT in Symptomatic HIV-1 Infected Patients With 200 - 500 CD4+ Cells/mm3. (NOTE: Asymptomatic HIV-1 Infected Patients Also Eligible)

CONDITION:
HIV Infections

INTERVENTION:
Butyldeoxynojirimycin

SUMMARY:

      To assess the dose-related antiviral effects of SC-48334 and zidovudine (AZT) administered
      in combination or individually in HIV-1 positive patients with 200 - 500 CD4+ cells/mm3. To
      determine the safety of escalating doses of SC-48334 when administered in combination with
      any of three doses of AZT to symptomatic HIV-1 positive patients with 200 - 500 CD4+
      cells/mm3, and to assess the pharmacokinetics of the two drugs, given separately and in
      combination.

             study entry).

          -  Malignancies, other than basal cell carcinoma and Kaposi's sarcoma (provided patient
             has fewer than 10 Kaposi's sarcoma lesions, no non-skin lesions, and no requirement
             for systemic treatment).

          -  Significant organ dysfunction.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to SC-48334 or AZT or related compounds.

        Concurrent Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Any investigational drug other than SC-48334.

          -  Any anti-HIV drug other than AZT.

          -  Cancer chemotherapy.

        Patients with the following prior conditions are excluded:

          -  History of cataracts or known increased risk of cataract formation.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to SC-48334 or AZT or related compounds.

          -  History of lactose intolerance.

        Prior Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Prior SC-48334.

          -  Cancer chemotherapy within 6 months prior to study entry.

          -  Treatment with any investigational drug or any drug with anti-HIV activity, other
             than AZT, within 30 days prior to study entry.

        Prior Treatment:

        Excluded:

        Whole-body irradiation within 6 months prior to study entry. Current use of illicit
        substances, or abuse of alcohol, which would limit compliance with the protocol.
