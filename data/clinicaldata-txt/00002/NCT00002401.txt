TITLE:
A Study of Delavirdine Used Together With Other Anti-HIV Drugs in HIV-Infected Patients

CONDITION:
HIV Infections

INTERVENTION:
Indinavir sulfate

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to give delavirdine (DLV) in
      combination with two or three other drugs to HIV-infected patients. The drugs to be used in
      combination with DLV are zidovudine (ZDV), indinavir (IDV), and lamivudine (3TC).
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      In this open-label pilot study, patients are randomized to 1of the following 4 arms for 24
      weeks:

      Arm 1 (40 patients): DLV plus ZDV plus IDV. Arm 2 (40 patients): DLV plus IDV plus 3TC*. Arm
      3 (40 patients): DLV plus ZDV plus IDV plus 3TC. Arm 4 (40 patients): ZDV plus IDV plus 3TC.

        -  Dose determined by body weight. Patients may opt to continue on study for 24 additional
           weeks at the discretion of the investigator.
