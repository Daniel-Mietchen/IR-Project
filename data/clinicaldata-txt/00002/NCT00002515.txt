TITLE:
Combination Chemotherapy Followed by Bone Marrow Transplantation in Treating Patients With Rare Cancer

CONDITION:
Childhood Germ Cell Tumor

INTERVENTION:
filgrastim

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Bone marrow transplantation may allow doctors to give higher
      doses of chemotherapy and kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy with
      thiotepa, carboplatin, and topotecan followed by bone marrow transplantation in treating
      patients who have metastatic or progressive rare cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Improve the long term disease-free survival of patients with rare cancers at high risk
           for lethal relapse by using myeloablative chemotherapy with thiotepa, carboplatin, and
           topotecan followed by autologous bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell rescue.

      OUTLINE: Autologous bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are harvested.
      Patients receive high-dose thiotepa IV over 3 hours on days -8 to -6, carboplatin IV over 4
      hours on days -5 to -3, and topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days -8 to -4. Autologous bone
      marrow or PBSC are reinfused on day 0. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) IV twice daily
      beginning on day 1.

      Patients are followed for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 50 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 years.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Histologically confirmed malignancy of one of the following types:

               -  Wilms' tumor

               -  Liver cancer

               -  Desmoplastic or other small round cell tumor

               -  Nasopharyngeal carcinoma

               -  Fibrosarcoma

          -  Disease that has metastasized and has a cure rate of no greater than 25% with
             conventional treatment or disease that has progressed after prior chemotherapy, was
             not then surgically resectable, and has a salvage rate with nonmyeloablative
             therapies of no greater than 25% required

          -  Maximal benefit from conventional (nonmyeloablative) doses of combination
             chemotherapy required prior to entry, and it is recommended that patients have
             received a minimum of one of the following:

               -  2 courses of high-dose cyclophosphamide (as per protocol MSKCC-90062)

               -  2 courses of high-dose ifosfamide/etoposide (as in the poor-risk sarcoma
                  protocol MSKCC-90071A)

               -  1 course of high-dose cyclophosphamide plus 1 course of high-dose
                  ifosfamide/etoposide

          -  Within 3 weeks of initiation of protocol therapy, patients must be:

               -  In CR or good PR OR

               -  Tumor considered "chemosensitive", i.e., a 50% or greater decrease in at least 1
                  measurable tumor parameter attributable to prior chemotherapy without evidence
                  of progressive disease by any other parameter

          -  Ineligible for other IRB-approved myeloablative regimens

          -  No evidence of current bone marrow involvement on bone marrow aspiration (x4) and
             biopsy (x2)
