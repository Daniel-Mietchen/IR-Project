TITLE:
A Study of ALRT1057 in Patients With AIDS-Related Kaposi's Sarcoma

CONDITION:
Sarcoma, Kaposi

INTERVENTION:
Alitretinoin

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to see if ALRT1057 is safe and effective in treating patients
      with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma (KS).
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Patients receive open-label ALRT1057 for 16 weeks, as tolerated. In the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity, patients may continue treatment indefinitely provided they continue
      to benefit from therapy and the study remains open and active.

      Thirteen patients are treated initially. If at least one response is observed in these
      patients, up to 14 additional patients will be evaluated.
