TITLE:
S9714: Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Stage IIIB or Stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer

CONDITION:
Lung Cancer

INTERVENTION:
paclitaxel

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy with paclitaxel in
      treating patients with stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess survival, progression-free survival and response rate of patients with
      bronchioloalveolar carcinoma receiving paclitaxel. II. Evaluate toxic effects of paclitaxel
      in 96 hour continuous infusion patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive 6 cycles of paclitaxel by IV continuous infusion over 96 hours.
      Before cycle 4, restaging is performed. If disease progression is witnessed, patients are
      removed from the study. If a stable, partial, or complete response is observed, patients
      receive the total of 6 cycles. Three weeks after the last cycle, final restaging is
      performed. Patients are followed every 3 months while on treatment and every 6 months
      thereafter, unless more frequent follow-up is clinically recommended.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 50 patients will be enrolled. The accrual rate is estimated at 25 per
      year.
