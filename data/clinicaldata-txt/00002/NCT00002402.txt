      the deltoid muscle at 0, 1, 6, and 12 months:

      Arm A: Patients receive 1 of 3 doses of AIDSVAX B/B vaccine (MN rgp120/HIV-1 plus GNE8
      rgp120/HIV-1) in alum adjuvant.

      Arm B: Patients receive AIDSVAX B/E (MN rgp120/HIV-1 plus A244 rgp120/HIV-1) vaccine in alum
      adjuvant.

      Patients are evaluated at 1 hr, 3 days, and 14 days after each immunization and at 18 months
      after the first immunization.

      An interim analysis is performed after all patients receive the second dose (at 1 month).
