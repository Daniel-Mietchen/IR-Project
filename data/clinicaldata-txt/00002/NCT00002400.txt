TITLE:
A Study of Two Anti-HIV Drug Combinations in HIV-Infected Patients

CONDITION:
HIV Infections

INTERVENTION:
Indinavir sulfate

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of giving HIV-infected
      patients delavirdine (DLV) plus zidovudine (ZDV) plus 2 doses of indinavir (IDV) or ZDV plus
      IDV plus lamivudine (3TC). This study also examines how the body processes DLV when it is
      given in combination with other drugs.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      In this multicenter, open-label study, 45 HIV-1-positive patients receive either combination
      drug therapy with delavirdine (DLV), zidovudine (ZDV), and indinavir (IDV) or combination
      drug therapy with ZDV, lamivudine (3TC), and IDV. NOTE: Patients are treated for 24 weeks
      and may opt to continue on study for 24 additional weeks, if HIV-1 RNA is less than 5,000
      copies/ml or at the investigator's discretion.
