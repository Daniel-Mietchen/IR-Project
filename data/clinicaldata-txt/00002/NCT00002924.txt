TITLE:
Gene Mutations in Patients With Advanced Prostate Cancer That Is Not Responsive to Hormone Therapy

CONDITION:
Prostate Cancer

INTERVENTION:
mutation analysis

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Gene mutations may make prostate cancer cells unable to attach to androgens. This
      may permit the growth of prostate cancer. Gene testing may improve the identification of
      patients with advanced prostate cancer.

      PURPOSE: Clinical trial to study the androgen receptor gene in patients with prostate cancer
      that is not responsive to hormone therapy.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        1. the feasibility of collecting bone marrow biopsies from prostate cancer patients in a
           cooperative group setting

        2. the incidence of marrow invasion by prostate tumor in random bone marrow biopsy

        3. the influence of previous prostate radiation on obtaining prostate tumor

        4. the frequency and type of AR mutations and

        5. association of AR mutations with response to antiandrogen withdrawal.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: Male
Age: N/A to N/A
Criteria:

        1. Histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate that is refractory to hormone
             therapy

          2. Patients who are eligible for anticancer therapy on Protocol CLB-9480, CLB-9583,
             CLB-9680, or CLB-9780 are also eligible for this study if they have not started
             treatment on those protocols
