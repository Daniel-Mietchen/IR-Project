TITLE:
Combination Chemotherapy Plus Bone Marrow or Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation in Treating Patients With Myeloproliferative Disorders

CONDITION:
Chronic Myeloproliferative Disorders

INTERVENTION:
busulfan

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplantation
      with chemotherapy may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill
      more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus either
      bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients with
      myeloproliferative disorders.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Assess disease free survival in patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis treated with a
           preparative busulfan/cyclophosphamide regimen followed by allogeneic bone marrow or
           peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.

        -  Determine the risk of primary graft failure in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive a preparative regimen consisting of oral busulfan every 6 hours on
      days -7 through -4 and cyclophosphamide on days -3 and -2. Patients then receive allogeneic
      bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells on day 0. Patients registered on protocol
      FHCRC-1106.00 randomized to stem cell transplant receive unmodified G-CSF-mobilized stem
      cells from an HLA-identical donor.

      Patients receive cyclosporine/methotrexate or tacrolimus/methotrexate as prophylaxis for
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Patients receiving marrow from unrelated donors are
      eligible for appropriate GVHD prophylaxis studies.

      Patients are followed at 6 and 12 months after transplant.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 20 patients will be accrued for this study over
      approximately 3.5 years.
