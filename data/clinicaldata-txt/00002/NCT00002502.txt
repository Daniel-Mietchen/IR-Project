TITLE:
Combination Chemotherapy and Bone Marrow Transplantation in Treating Patients With Leukemia or Myelodysplastic Syndrome

CONDITION:
Leukemia

INTERVENTION:
busulfan

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with bone marrow transplantation may
      allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy consisting of
      busulfan and cyclophosphamide followed by bone marrow transplantation in treating patients
      who have acute or chronic leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effect of marrow ablation with high dose
      busulfan/cyclophosphamide on engraftment, incidence of posttransplant relapse, incidence and
      severity of graft versus host disease (GVHD), and incidence and severity of nonGVHD
      posttransplant complications in patients with acute or chronic leukemia or myelodysplastic
      syndrome who are eligible for allogeneic bone marrow transplants from HLA
      identical/compatible donors but who cannot or should not receive total body irradiation as
      part of their cytoreductive regimen.

      OUTLINE: 2-Drug Combination Cytoreductive Chemotherapy followed by Bone Marrow Transplant
      with, as indicated, CNS Prophylaxis. Busulfan, BU, NSC-750; Cyclophosphamide, CTX,
      NSC-26271; followed by Allogeneic Bone Marrow, AlBM; with, as indicated, Intrathecal
      Cytarabine, IT ARA-C, NSC-63878.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 15 patients will be accrued for this study.
    

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: N/A to 55 Years
Criteria:

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Primary or secondary acute nonlymphocytic leukemia and acute
        lymphocytic leukemia in one of the following states: First or greater remission Early
        relapse Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in one of the following states: First or
        greater chronic phase Treatment on this protocol is preferred to total body irradiation
        containing protocols for patients under 40 with CML in stable first chronic phase who are
        otherwise eligible for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation Accelerated phase Myeloid or
        lymphoid blast crisis Myelodysplastic syndromes of the following types: Refractory anemia
        Refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts Refractory anemia with excess blasts Chronic
        myelomonocytic leukemia Multiple myeloma Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma HLA identical bone marrow
        donor available Unable to undergo total body irradiation because of one of the following
        reasons: Under age 2 (CNS still growing and at high risk of permanent radiation injury)
        Prior high dose radiotherapy to the brain, lungs, heart, liver, or abdomen In relapse
        following allogeneic or autologous transplant using total body irradiation for ablation,
        but eligible for a second transplant No current CNS involvement

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: 50 and under (patients aged 51-55 accrued on a case-by-case
        basis after discussion and approval by the BMT service) Performance status: Karnofsky
        70-100% Life expectancy: Greater than 8 weeks Hematopoietic: Not specified Hepatic:
        Bilirubin less than 1.5 mg/dL AST no greater than 3 times normal Neither value increasing
        for at least 2-4 weeks prior to transplant Renal: Creatinine less than 2 times normal and
        not rising for at least 2-4 weeks prior to transplant OR Creatinine clearance greater than
        80 mL/min Cardiovascular: Left ventricular ejection fraction at least 50% Cardiac function
        good Pulmonary: No severe restrictive lung disease No chronic obstructive pulmonary
        disease Other: No active viral or bacterial infection at transplant No coexisting medical
        problem that would significantly increase the risk of the transplant procedure Not
        pregnant

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Prior therapy allowed, including prior bone marrow transplant
