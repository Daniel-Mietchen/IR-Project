TITLE:
Immunotherapy After Surgery in Treating Patients With Breast Cancer, Colon Cancer, or Melanoma

CONDITION:
Breast Cancer

INTERVENTION:
Corynebacterium granulosum P40

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Immunotherapy uses different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop cancer
      cells from growing. Immunotherapy biological extracts may be useful as adjuvant therapy in
      treating patients who have had surgery for breast cancer, colon cancer, or melanoma.

      PURPOSE: Phase III trial to study the effectiveness of Corynebacterium granulosum extract as
      maintenance immunotherapy following surgery in treating patients with breast cancer, colon
      cancer, or melanoma.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the survival of patients with colon cancer, breast cancer, or melanoma with
           minimal residual disease after surgical resection treated with maintenance
           immunotherapy using Corynebacterium granulosum P40.

        -  Determine leucocyte adherence inhibition, an indication of metastases, over time in
           patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified by center and are matched with
      case-controls by disease type and stage.

      Beginning 2 weeks after surgical resection, patients receive Corynebacterium granulosum P40
      subcutaneously weekly for 6 weeks, followed by rest for 3 months. Treatment continues for
      life.

      Patients are followed for survival.
