TITLE:
Combination Chemotherapy Followed by Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation in Treating Patients With Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia

CONDITION:
Leukemia

INTERVENTION:
filgrastim

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Bone marrow transplantation may be able to replace immune cells
      that were destroyed by chemotherapy used to kill cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy followed by
      G-CSF and peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients with chronic myelogenous
      leukemia.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy of MCE (mitoxantrone/cytarabine/etoposide) followed by
      granulocyte colony-stimulating factor to mobilize peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) in
      patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). II. Evaluate the toxicity of this regimen.
      III. Evaluate the cytoreductive effects of this regimen in CML as determined by the ability
      to mobilize Philadelphia chromosome-negative PBSC. IV. Assess the time of peak CD34+ and
      CD34+/CD38- cell concentrations in the peripheral blood of patients treated with this
      regimen.

      OUTLINE: The following acronyms are used: ARA-C Cytarabine, NSC-63878 DHAD Mitoxantrone,
      NSC-301739 G-CSF Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (source not specified) HU
      Hydroxyurea, NSC-32065 MCE DHAD/ARA-C/VP-16 VP-16 Etoposide, NSC-141540 Single-Agent
      Cytoreduction followed by 3-Drug Combination Chemotherapy/Stem Cell Mobilization. HU;
      followed by MCE; G-CSF.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 30 patients will be entered over 3 years.
