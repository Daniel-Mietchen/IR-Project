TITLE:
An Open, Non-Comparative Study of Intravenous and Oral Fluconazole in the Treatment of Acute Cryptococcal Meningitis

CONDITION:
Meningitis, Cryptococcal

INTERVENTION:
Fluconazole

SUMMARY:

      To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of fluconazole as an intravenous dose as initial
      treatment for acute cryptococcal meningitis followed by oral therapy in AIDS and non-AIDS
      patients. Lack of satisfactory response will allow increase of dose. Both newly diagnosed
      and relapsed patients are eligible.
