TITLE:
Study of a New Protease Inhibitor, BMS-232632, in Combination With Other Anti-HIV Drugs

CONDITION:
HIV Infections

INTERVENTION:
Atazanavir

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a new protease inhibitor known as BMS-232632. This
      drug will be given in combination with 2 other anti-HIV drugs (stavudine and didanosine).
      The effectiveness of BMS-232632 against HIV infection will be compared to that of
      nelfinavir, a protease inhibitor that is already commonly prescribed.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Patients are randomized to receive one of two drug regimens: BMS-232632, ddI, and d4T or
      NFV, ddI, and d4T. Three different doses of BMS-232632 are used in this study. Randomization
      is stratified for HIV RNA level (less than 30,000 copies/ml versus 30,000 or greater
      copies/ml). Patients remain on their drug regimen for 48 weeks.
