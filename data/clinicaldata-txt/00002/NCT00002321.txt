TITLE:
A Phase I Study of the Safety of Proleukin (Aldesleukin) in Combination With Ganciclovir and Antiretroviral Therapy in HIV Seropositive Patients With Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Retinitis

CONDITION:
Cytomegalovirus Retinitis

INTERVENTION:
Aldesleukin

SUMMARY:

      To determine the MTD and dose-limiting toxicities of a regimen of therapeutic ganciclovir,
      antiretroviral therapy, and recombinant interleukin-2 (aldesleukin; Proleukin) as an immune
      adjuvant in HIV-seropositive patients. To investigate the effect of increasing doses of
      Proleukin on the time to progression of CMV retinitis in patients being treated with
      therapeutic ganciclovir and antiretroviral therapy. To evaluate the incidence and level of
      anti-IL-2 antibody formation to subcutaneously administered Proleukin in this patient
      population.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Patients will receive subcutaneous Proleukin in combination with ganciclovir and
      antiretroviral therapy, and the MTD will be determined.
