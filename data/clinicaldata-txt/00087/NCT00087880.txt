TITLE:
Maintaining Abstinence in Chronic Cigarette Smokers - 1

CONDITION:
Tobacco Use Disorder

INTERVENTION:
Bupropion and NRT

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the extended pharmacological and psychological
      treatment for chronic cigarette smokers.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      The work adapts interventions that have been successful in the general populations, and
      tailors them to chronic smokers, who may have numerous previous smoking treatment failures.
      If successful it will: (1) make available a treatment intervention that produces hight long
      term abstinence rates; (2) provide information on variables that predicts success and
      failure in this population of smokers; (3) examine the cost-effectiveness of more intensive,
      longer term treatments.
