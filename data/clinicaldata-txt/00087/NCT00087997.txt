TITLE:
A Study of STA-4783 in Combination With Weekly Paclitaxel for Treatment of Patients With Soft Tissue Sarcomas

CONDITION:
Soft Tissue Sarcoma

INTERVENTION:
STA-4783

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of an experimental
      study drug (STA-4783) combined with an approved cancer medicine, paclitaxel, in the
      treatment of soft tissue sarcomas. Paclitaxel (Taxol) has been approved and used in the
      United States since 1992.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      STA-4783 is a taxane potentiator, enhancing the effect of antitumor response of paclitaxel.
      In an attempt to improve efficacy, paclitaxel is sometimes used in combination with other
      anticancer agents. When paclitaxel is combined with other anticancer agents, although
      response rate is usually increased, side effects are usually increased as well. There is an
      urgent need for agents that can enhance the antitumor effects of paclitaxel without further
      increasing undesirable side effects.
