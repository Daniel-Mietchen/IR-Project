TITLE:
Rebeccamycin Analog in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Myelodysplastic Syndrome, Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, or Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia

CONDITION:
Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia With 11q23 (MLL) Abnormalities

INTERVENTION:
becatecarin

SUMMARY:

      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of rebeccamycin analog in
      treating patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic
      syndrome, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast phase.
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as rebeccamycin analog, work in different ways to stop
      cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of rebeccamycin analogue
      (XL119) in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic
      syndromes, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or chronic myelogenous leukemia in blastic phase.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive rebeccamycin analogue (XL119) IV over 1 hour on days 1-5. Courses repeat
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      achieving a complete response (CR) receive 1 additional course beyond CR. Patients achieving
      a partial response (PR) or hematologic improvement (HI) receive 2 additional courses beyond
      PR or HI. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of XL119 until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.
