TITLE:
A Randomized Phase 3 Trial of Pemetrexed and Cisplatin Versus Gemcitabine and Cisplatin in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer

CONDITION:
Non Small Cell Lung Carcinoma

INTERVENTION:
pemetrexed

SUMMARY:

      This study is a randomized Phase 3 study comparing pemetrexed and cisplatin combination to
      gemcitabine and cisplatin for the treatment of Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NCSLC).
      Gemcitabine plus cisplatin is currently the standard of care for NSCLC. It is thought that
      pemetrexed plus cisplatin may be as effective and may have fewer side effects than the
      standard of care.
