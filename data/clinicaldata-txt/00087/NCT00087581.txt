TITLE:
Study of Therapeutic Monitoring of Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF/CellCept) After Kidney Transplantation

CONDITION:
Kidney Transplantation

INTERVENTION:
Mycophenolate mofetil

SUMMARY:

      This three-arm study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of various dosing regimens of MMF
      combined with various dosing regimens of calcineurin inhibitor (CNI), either cyclosporine or
      tacrolimus, in participants who have undergone kidney transplantation. Participants will be
      randomized to one of three dosing regimens to receive concentration-controlled MMF with
      reduced CNI, concentration-controlled MMF with standard CNI, or fixed-dose MMF with standard
      CNI. Participants will be followed for 20-24 months after randomization.
