TITLE:
Study of Oral SCIO-469 in Relapsed, Refractory Patients With Multiple Myeloma

CONDITION:
Multiple Myeloma

INTERVENTION:
SCIO-469

SUMMARY:

      The main objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of SCIOS-469 as monotherapy in
      relapsed, refractory patients with multiple myeloma (MM), based on response rates.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      The main objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of SCIO-469 as monotherapy in
      relapsed, refractory patients with multiple myeloma (MM), based on response rates. Patients
      took SCIO-469 two capsules (60 mg) by mouth three times a day with water, preferably with a
      meal, for 72 days except on Days 1 and 30 of monotherapy and Days 1 and 11 of combination
      therapy. On these days, the second dose of SCIO-469 was administered after collection of the
      12-hour PK sample, and the third dose was not administered.
