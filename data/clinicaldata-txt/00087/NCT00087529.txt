placebo

SUMMARY:

      This is a Phase II/III, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo controlled,

          -  Presence of other significant, uncontrolled cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal,
             hepatic, endocrine, or gastrointestinal disease that might interfere with a subject's
             ability to participate and to complete approximately 2.5 years of study participation

          -  History or presence of myelopathy due to spinal cord compression by disk or vertebral
             disease

          -  History of severe, clinically significant central nervous system trauma (e.g.,
             cerebral contusion, spinal cord compression)

          -  History of intracranial or intraspinal tumor (e.g., meningioma, glioma)

          -  History or presence of potential metabolic cause of myelopathy or encephalopathy
             (e.g., vitamin B12 deficiency, thyroid abnormalities)

          -  History or presence of infectious causes of myelopathy (e.g., syphilis, Lyme disease,
             human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 [HTLV-1], or herpes zoster myelopathy)

          -  History of genetically inherited progressive CNS degenerative disorder (e.g.,
