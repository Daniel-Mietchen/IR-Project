TITLE:
S0400, FR901228 in Treating Patients With Advanced Cancer of the Urothelium

CONDITION:
Bladder Cancer

INTERVENTION:
Depsipeptide

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as FR901228 (depsipeptide), work in different
      ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well FR901228 works in treating patients with
      advanced cancer of the urothelium that has progressed or recurred after receiving one
      chemotherapy regimen.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the response (confirmed complete and partial) in patients with advanced
           transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium that has progressed after prior
           chemotherapy when treated with FR901228 (depsipeptide) .

        -  Determine progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this drug in these
           patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the effects of this drug on reversing tumor promoter gene
           methylation in these patients.

        -  Correlate, preliminarily, tumor DNA in plasma with response or outcome in patients
           treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive FR901228 (depsipeptide) IV over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients achieving a complete response receive 2 additional courses of treatment.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
