A Safety and Effectiveness Study of Aroplatin in Patients With Advanced Solid Malignancies

CONDITION:
Esophageal Neoplasms

INTERVENTION:
Aroplatin (Liposomal NDDP, L-NDDP)

SUMMARY:

      To determine the rate of response and the duration of the response following therapy with
      Aroplatinin patients with advanced solid malignancies.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Primary Objective:

        -  Determine response rate (RR; complete and partial response [CR, PR]) and duration after
           therapy with Aroplatin in patients with advanced solid malignancies.

      Secondary Objective:

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of Aroplatin
