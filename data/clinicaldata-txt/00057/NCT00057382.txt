TITLE:
T138067 Versus Doxorubicin in Chemotherapy-Naive, Unresectable, Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients

CONDITION:
Hepatocellular Carcinoma

INTERVENTION:
T138067 intravenous

SUMMARY:

      This is an international, multicenter, randomized study of intravenous T138067 versus
      intravenous doxorubicin in hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer). Patients can not have
      been treated before with chemotherapy and surgery is not recommended for their cancer. A
      total of 750 subjects will be enrolled in this study.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
NONE

ELIGIBILITY:
Gender: All
Age: 18 Years to N/A
Criteria:

        Key inclusion criteria include:

          -  pathologic diagnosis of unresectable HCC

          -  chemotherapy-nave for HCC

          -  Child-Pugh Class A or B liver disease

          -  measurable disease (i.e., at least one lesion that is at least 20 mm in one
             dimension) on computerized tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
             or at least one lesion that is at least 10 mm on spiral CT scan

          -  Karnofsky Performance Status of  70%

          -  life expectancy of  12 weeks

          -  adequate hematologic function (i.e., absolute neutrophil count [ANC] of  1500
             cells/mm3, platelet count of  80,000 cells/mm3, hemoglobin of  8.5 g/dL)

          -  total bilirubin of  1.5 upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT)  5 ULN

          -  serum creatinine of  2 x ULN

        Key exclusion criteria include:

          -  severe, concurrent disease that would make the subject inappropriate for enrollment

          -  Subjects who have received prior intravenous or intra-arterial chemotherapy,
             chemoembolization, intratumoral ethanol injection, cryosurgery, radiofrequency
             ablation, or embolization for their HCC. (note: prior surgical resection,
             immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, radiotherapy, and/or orthotopic liver
             transplantation are allowed)

          -  history of other cancer within the past 5 years other than adequately treated basal
             cell or squamous cell skin cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix

          -  New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV heart disease or a left ventricular
             ejection fraction of <50% or acute anginal symptoms

          -  females who are pregnant or breast-feeding

          -  received any investigational agent within 4 weeks of enrollment

          -  history of central nervous system metastases or carcinomatous meningitis

          -  clinically apparent ascites

          -  major surgery within 4 weeks of study enrollment
