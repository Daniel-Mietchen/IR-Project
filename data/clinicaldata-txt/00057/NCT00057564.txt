TITLE:
A Study of Combination Thalidomide Plus Dexamethasone Therapy vs. Dexamethasone Therapy Alone in Previously Untreated Subjects With Multiple Myeloma

CONDITION:
Multiple Myeloma

INTERVENTION:
A (Thalidomide + Dexamethasone)

SUMMARY:

      To compare the efficacy of combination oral thalidomide plus oral dexamethasone treatment to
      that of oral dexamethasone-alone treatments as induction (first-line) therapy for subjects
      with active multiple myeloma

NONE
