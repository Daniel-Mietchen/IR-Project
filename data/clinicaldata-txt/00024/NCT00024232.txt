TITLE:
Monoclonal Antibody Therapy in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer

CONDITION:
Prostate Cancer

INTERVENTION:
monoclonal antibody huJ591

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver
      tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy in
      treating patients who have prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the antitumor effects of monoclonal antibody huJ591 in patients with
           progressive androgen-independent prostate cancer.

        -  Determine the biodistribution and dosimetry of this antibody in these patients.

        -  Determine the effect on biodistribution of the delivery sequence of unlabeled vs indium
           In 111-labeled antibody in these patients.

        -  Determine the HAHA response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Correlate the dose of monoclonal antibody huJ591 with antibody-dependent cellular
           cytotoxicity in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to one of two treatment groups.

        -  Group I: Patients receive monoclonal antibody huJ591 IV followed by indium In 111
           monoclonal antibody huJ591 on day 1.

        -  Group II: Patients receive monoclonal antibody huJ591 concurrently with indium In 111
           monoclonal antibody huJ591 as in group I.

      Treatment in both groups repeats every 3 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for 4 weeks and then monthly for 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14 patients (7 per treatment group) will be accrued for this
      study.
