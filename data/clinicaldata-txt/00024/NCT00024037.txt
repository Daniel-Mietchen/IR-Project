TITLE:
Laser Therapy in Preventing Oral Mucositis in Patients Undergoing Bone Marrow Transplantation

CONDITION:
Oral Complications

INTERVENTION:
management of therapy complications

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Laser therapy may reduce the severity of symptoms and speed healing of oral
      mucositis. It is not yet known if laser therapy is effective in preventing oral mucositis.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II/III trial to determine the effectiveness of laser therapy in
      preventing oral mucositis in patients who are undergoing bone marrow transplantation.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether low-energy laser therapy can prevent oral mucositis in
      patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are
      randomized to one of three treatment arms. Arm I: Patients undergo low-energy laser therapy
      with visible red light (650 nm) daily over 15-20 minutes beginning on the first day of their
      transplant conditioning regimen and continuing until day 2 after bone marrow
      transplantation. Arm II: Patients undergo low-energy laser therapy with invisible infra-red
      light (780 nm) daily on the same schedule as in arm I. Arm III: Patients undergo sham laser
      therapy daily on the same schedule as in arm I. Patients are followed on days 3, 7, 10, 14,
      18, 21, and 24.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 66 patients (22 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.

        infections No active uncontrolled oral bleeding that would preclude laser therapy

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: Not specified Chemotherapy: Not specified
        Endocrine therapy: Not specified Radiotherapy: Not specified Surgery: Not specified Other:
        Not currently enrolled on other protocols with oral mucositis as a stated end point (e.g.,
        conditioning regimen toxicity trials or GVHD prophylaxis trials) No other concurrent
        investigational drugs or agents for the prevention or treatment of mucositis No concurrent
        photosensitizing agents
