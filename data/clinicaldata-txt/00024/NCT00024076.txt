TITLE:
Radiofrequency Ablation in Treating Patients With Refractory or Advanced Lung Cancer

CONDITION:
Lung Cancer

INTERVENTION:
radiofrequency ablation

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Radiofrequency ablation uses high-frequency electric current to kill tumor cells.
      CT-guided radiofrequency ablation may be effective treatment for lung cancer.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation in treating
      patients who have refractory or advanced lung cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of radiofrequency ablation in patients with
           refractory or advanced pulmonary malignancies.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this treatment, in terms of local control, in these patients.

        -  Determine whether CT scan is a reasonable imaging assessment tool for treatment
           delivery and follow-up in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo percutaneous CT-guided radiofrequency ablation directly to the
      tumor over 2 hours.

      Patients are followed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
