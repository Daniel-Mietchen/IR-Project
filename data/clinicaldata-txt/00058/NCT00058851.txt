TITLE:
Massage Therapy for Breast Cancer Treatment-Related Swelling of the Arms

CONDITION:
Lymphedema

INTERVENTION:
Manual lymph drainage

SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to examine the short-term and long-term efficacy of massage
      therapy alone compared to massage therapy plus compression bandaging in the treatment of
      breast cancer treatment-related swelling of the arms and legs.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Massage therapy (in the form of manual lymph drainage [MLD]) and compression bandaging (CB)
      are integral components of combined physical therapy (CPT), the recommended treatment for
      peripheral lymphedema (LE). According to the World Health Organization, LE afflicts hundreds
      of millions worldwide and probably millions in the United States. Effects of various forms
      of massage on lymph circulation have been postulated for more than a century, but the
      efficacy of MLD alone without CB has not been demonstrated. New data suggest that MLD alone
      reduces established LE volume as effectively as CB in combination with CPT and minimizes LE
      development.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to either treatment with MLD alone or a combination of
      MLD and CB. Patients will be treated in 10 one-hour sessions over 2 weeks. They will also
      undergo lymphangioscintigraphy (a nuclear medicine test) to depict the function of their
      lymphatic system. Patients will continue self treatment at home and will be followed for 6
      months.
