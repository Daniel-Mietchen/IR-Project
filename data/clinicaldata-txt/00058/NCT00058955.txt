DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      The purpose of this study is to learn more about the effects of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid by
      comparing its physiological, behavioral and subjective effects with those of several other
      drugs.

      This trial will be conducted as a double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled,
      counter-balanced (Latin-square design) crossover study in volunteers with histories of
      sedative abuse. Volunteers will be recruited through advertising and word-of-mouth.

      Volunteers will reside on our residential research unit for the duration of the study and
      participate in a maximum of 16 experimental sessions. Sessions will be conducted five days a
      week (Monday through Friday). The primary subjective and behavioral measures will be taken
      before drug administration and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 hours after drug
      administration.
