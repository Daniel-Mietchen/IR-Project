TITLE:
A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Herceptin (Trastuzumab) in Combination With Arimidex (Anastrozole) an Aromatase Inhibitor Compared to Arimidex Alone in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer

CONDITION:
Breast Cancer

INTERVENTION:
trastuzumab (Herceptin)

SUMMARY:

      This 2 arm study assessed the safety and efficacy of adding intravenous trastuzumab
      (Herceptin) to daily oral anastrozole (Arimidex) tablets as first- and second-line
      treatment in postmenopausal patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)
      overexpressing metastatic breast cancer (ER+ve and/or PR+ve). Patients were randomized to
      receive either anastrazole 1 mg per os (po) daily, or anastrazole 1 mg po daily + a loading
      dose of Herceptin 4 mg/kg intravenous (iv) followed by weekly doses of Herceptin 2 mg/kg
      iv. The anticipated time on study treatment was until disease progression, and the target
      sample size was 100-500 individuals.
