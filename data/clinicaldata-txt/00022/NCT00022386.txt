TITLE:
Epoetin Alfa in Treating Chemotherapy-Related Anemia in Women With Stage I, Stage II, or Stage III Breast Cancer

CONDITION:
Anemia

INTERVENTION:
epoetin alfa

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Epoetin alfa may stimulate red blood cell production to treat patients who have
      anemia following chemotherapy.

      PURPOSE: Phase IV trial to study the effectiveness of epoetin alfa in treating
      chemotherapy-related anemia in women who have stage I, stage II, or stage III breast cancer.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effectiveness and safety of epoetin alfa in patients receiving
      adjuvant chemotherapy for stage I, II, or III breast cancer. II. Determine the clinical
      outcomes in these patients receiving this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive epoetin alfa subcutaneously once
      weekly for up to 24 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is
      assessed at baseline, at week 13, and at study completion.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 2,500 patients will be accrued for this study.
