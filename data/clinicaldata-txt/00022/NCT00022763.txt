TITLE:
T-20 Plus a Selected Anti-HIV Treatment in HIV-Infected Children and Adolescents

CONDITION:
HIV Infections

INTERVENTION:
Enfuvirtide

SUMMARY:

      This study will evaluate T-20 in children.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      Children are stratified by age group (3 through 11 years and 12 through 16 years). Samples
      for HIV-1 genotype and phenotype resistance testing are obtained at screening to aid in the
      selection of concomitant antiretrovirals. Simultaneous to initiating T-20, all patients
      begin a "new" optimized antiretroviral regimen based on the patients' prior treatment
      history, historical resistance testing results, and the results of the testing performed at
      screening. Patients are followed for safety and other assessments at Weeks 1, 2, and 4, then
      monthly through Week 24 and bimonthly through Week 48. Pharmacokinetic sampling at selected
      study visits are performed.
