TITLE:
Epratuzumab in Treating Patients With Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma

CONDITION:
Lymphoma

INTERVENTION:
epratuzumab

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as epratuzumab can locate tumor cells and either kill
      them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of epratuzumab in treating patients
      who have low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that has not responded to chemotherapy or
      rituximab.
    

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety of epratuzumab in patients with rituximab-refractory low-grade
           follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

        -  Confirm the convenient administration of this drug in this patient population.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this drug in terms of objective response rate in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the duration of response and time to progression in patients treated with
           this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive epratuzumab IV over 15-60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.

      Patients are followed every 8 weeks for 10 months and then every 3 months for up to 4 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30-100 patients will be accrued for this study.

          -  At least 1 bidimensionally measurable lesion

                  non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ. The terminology of "indolent" or
                  "aggressive" lymphoma will replace the terminology of "low", "intermediate", or
                  "high" grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses the former terminology.
