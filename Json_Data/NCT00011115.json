{"brief_title": "Motivations for Weight Loss", "brief_summary": "This study tests the effects of emphasizing different motivations for wanting to lose weight on weight loss maintenance in women. At the start of the study, participants will be weighed and will complete questionnaires about their health, weight history, eating and exercise habits, body satisfaction and mood. Participants will then be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatments. Participants in all 4 groups will receive information on topics related to eating and exercise, and will receive calorie and fat intake goals, and exercise goals. The 4 treatments will differ in the emphasis given to various reasons for wanting to lose weight. At 6, 12 and 18 months after enrollment, participants will again have weights measured and fill out questionnaires.", "condition": "Obesity", "intervention_type": "Behavioral", "intervention_name": "Weight loss motivations", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Body mass index greater than or equal to 27 and less than or equal to 35 - Rating both physical appearance and health concerns as important motivations for weight loss - Successful completion of a food and exercise diary over a 5-day period", "gender": "Female", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "55 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00011115.xml"}
