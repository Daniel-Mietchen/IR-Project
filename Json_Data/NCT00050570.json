{"brief_title": "Reducing Eating Disorder Risk Factors", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to determine whether a web-based program is effective in reducing the incidence of eating disorders in college women who are at high risk for developing an eating disorder.", "detailed_description": "Female college students who use unhealthy weight control methods and have body image concerns may be at risk for developing an eating disorder. Developing and evaluating interventions to reduce eating disorders in high-risk populations is of great public health importance. Participants are randomly assigned to either join a web-based risk-reduction program or receive no intervention. The 9-week risk-reduction program focuses on reducing body image and weight/shape concerns, identifying the risks of eating disorders, and increasing healthy weight regulation practices. The program includes weekly readings, writing assignments, and participation in a moderated electronic discussion group. Changes in body mass index (BMI) and the occurrence of major stressors and psychiatric events are assessed to determine their impact on the incidence of eating disorders. One-year incidence of eating disorders is determined by a diagnostic interview, and follow up may continue for up to 2.5 years.", "condition": "Eating Disorders", "intervention_type": "Behavioral", "intervention_name": "Web-based intervention to reduce eating disorder risk factors", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - College students at risk for developing an eating disorder Exclusion Criteria: - Suicidal or other severe psychopathology - Alcohol or drug abuse - Body mass index (BMI) < 18 or > 32 - Current diagnosis of anorexia nervosa, binge eating disorder, or bulimia nervosa and have been in treatment within the past 6 months", "gender": "Female", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "30 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "Accepts Healthy Volunteers", "id": "NCT00050570.xml"}
