{"brief_title": "Preventive Treatment Against Tuberculosis (TB) in Patients With Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection and Confirmed Latent Tuberculous Infection", "brief_summary": "To evaluate and compare the safety and effectiveness of a one-year course of isoniazid (INH) versus a two-month course of rifampin plus pyrazinamide for the prevention of reactivation tuberculosis in individuals infected with both HIV and latent (inactive) Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Current guidelines from the American Thoracic Society and the Centers for Disease Control recommend 6 to 12 months of INH for PPD (purified protein derivative)-positive individuals. Although the effectiveness of this treatment is not known for HIV-infected individuals, several studies using INH to prevent tuberculosis in presumably normal hosts have shown 60 to 80 percent effectiveness. Problems with this treatment include compliance, adverse reaction, and the possibility of not preventing disease due to tuberculosis organisms being resistant to INH. A two-month preventive treatment plan should help in increasing compliance. In addition, the use of two drugs (rifampin / pyrazinamide) may help overcome problems with drug resistance. If this study shows equal or greater effectiveness of the two-month rifampin / pyrazinamide treatment, it could alter the approach to tuberculosis prevention for both HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals.", "detailed_description": "Current guidelines from the American Thoracic Society and the Centers for Disease Control recommend 6 to 12 months of INH for PPD (purified protein derivative)-positive individuals.

Patients are chosen by a random selection process to either the INH or the rifampin / pyrazinamide arm of the dose. Patients on the INH arm receive INH plus vitamin B6 (pyridoxine hydrochloride ) daily for 12 months. Patients on the other arm receive rifampin plus pyrazinamide for 60 days. Dosage of rifampin and pyrazinamide depends on weight of patient.", "condition": "Tuberculosis", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Rifampin", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria Concurrent Medication: Allowed: - Antiretroviral treatment. - Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis. - Treatment for acute opportunistic infection.
