{"brief_title": "3-AP Followed By Fludarabine In Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute or Chronic Leukemia or High-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fludarabine, work in different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. 3-AP may help fludarabine kill more cancer cells by making them more sensitive to the drug. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of fludarabine when given together with 3-AP in treating patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia, chronic leukemia, or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the feasibility and tolerability of 3-AP (Triapine^\u00ae ) followed by fludarabine in patients with relapsed or refractory acute or chronic leukemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes. - Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of fludarabine. Patients are stratified according to disease (acute leukemias and myelodysplastic syndromes [MDS] vs chronic lymphocytic leukemia and prolymphocytic leukemia). Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups. - Group 1 (chronic lymphocytic leukemia or prolymphocytic leukemia): Patients receive 3-AP (Triapine^\u00ae) IV over 4 hours and fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of fludarabine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, 10 additional patients are treated at that dose level. - Group 2 (acute leukemias or MDS): Patients receive 3-AP IV continuously over 24 hours on day 1. Beginning within 4 hours after completion of 3-AP, patients receive fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days 2-6. In both groups, treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-34 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Leukemia", "Myelodysplastic Syndromes", "Myelodysplastic/Myeloproliferative Diseases"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["fludarabine phosphate", "triapine"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed diagnosis of 1 of the following: - High-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), including refractory anemia with excess blasts and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia - International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) score at least 1.5 based on the following: - More than 10% marrow blasts - Cytopenias in at least 2 lineages - Adverse cytogenetics - Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) - All subtypes, including MDS/AML and treatment-related (secondary) AML - Acute lymphoblastic leukemia - Acute progranulocytic leukemia - Ineligible for arsenic therapy - Chronic myelogenous leukemia - Accelerated phase or blastic crisis - Chronic lymphocytic leukemia - Prolymphocytic leukemia - Received or ineligible for established curative regimens, including stem cell transplantation - Acute and chronic leukemias must be relapsed and/or refractory with progressive disease since last therapy PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - 18 and over Performance status - ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy - Not specified Hematopoietic - No history of hemolytic anemia grade 2 or greater - No known glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency - G6PD screening required for high-risk groups (i.e., patients of African, Asian, or Mediterranean origin/ancestry) Hepatic - SGOT and SGPT no greater than 2.5 times normal - Bilirubin no greater than 2 mg/dL - No chronic hepatitis Renal - Creatinine normal OR - Creatinine clearance at least 60 mL/min Cardiovascular - No active heart disease - No myocardial infarction within the past 3 months - No severe coronary artery disease - No arrhythmias (other than atrial flutter or fibrillation) requiring medication - No uncontrolled congestive heart failure Pulmonary - No dyspnea at rest or with minimal exertion - No severe pulmonary disease requiring supplemental oxygen Other - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception - No neuropathy grade 2 or greater - No active uncontrolled infection - Infections under active treatment and controlled by antibiotics are allowed - No other life-threatening illness - No psychiatric illness that would preclude study compliance PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - See Disease Characteristics - At least 1 week since prior hematopoietic growth factor (e.g., epoetin alfa, filgrastim [G-CSF], sargramostim [GM-CSF], interleukin-3, and interleukin-11) - No concurrent immunotherapy Chemotherapy - Recovered from prior chemotherapy (no greater than grade 1 chronic toxic effects) - At least 72 hours since prior hydroxyurea - At least 3 weeks since prior myelosuppressive cytotoxic agents (6 weeks for mitomycin or nitrosoureas) - No more than 12 prior courses of fludarabine - No more than 3 prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens - No other concurrent chemotherapy Endocrine therapy - Not specified Radiotherapy - At least 2 weeks since prior radiotherapy - No concurrent radiotherapy Surgery - Not specified Other - At least 1 week since prior non-myelosuppressive treatment - No more than 4 prior induction regimens - No other concurrent therapy", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "adult acute myeloid leukemia with t(15;17)(q22;q12)", "mesh_term": ["Syndrome", "Leukemia", "Myelodysplastic Syndromes", "Preleukemia", "Myeloproliferative Disorders", "Myelodysplastic-Myeloproliferative Diseases", "Fludarabine", "Fludarabine phosphate", "Vidarabine"], "id": "NCT00077558"}
