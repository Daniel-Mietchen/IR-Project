{"brief_title": "Comparing Smoking Treatment Programs for Lighter Smokers - 1", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study was to compare two different types of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved smoking cessation medications (nicotine patch or bupropion) used in conjunction with two levels of counseling. It was hypothesized that the higher level of counseling would have the highest rates of treatment completion and highest rates of abstinence.", "detailed_description": "The study compared a minimal level counseling model to a higher level counseling model plus one of two types of FDA approved smoking cessation products (bupropion or the nicotine patch)used to achieve long term abstinence among lighter smokers. Each participant received both products under blinded conditions meaning that neither the participant nor the counselor knew which product was real or a placebo. The primary goal was to determine the combination or combinations of high or low intensity counseling and pharmacotherapy (either bupropion or the nicotine patch) that were most effective for lighter smokers. The main hypothesis was that higher level counseling would contribute to improved outcomes meaning that more counseling would be associated higher abstinence rates following the completion of treatment and at longer term follow-up.", "condition": ["Tobacco Use Disorder"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Behavioral", "Behavioral", "Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["nicotine transdermal system", "bupropion", "Medication Management", "Mayo Counseling", "placebo patch", "placebo bupropion"], "description": ["starting with 21 or 14mg dependent on number of cigarettes per day smoked upon entry in the study; titrated down over 8 weeks.", "150 mg/day X 3 days 300mg/day for 60 days Total 9 weeks", "Brief manual based therapy; four 15 minute session over 10 weeks.", "Manual based therapy; Weekly 30 minute sessions for 10 weeks", "placebo patch containing no nicotine", "placebo pills"], "arm_group_label": ["3 Patch+MM", "4 Patch+Mayo", "1: Bup+MM", "2 Bup+Mayo", "1: Bup+MM", "3 Patch+MM", "2 Bup+Mayo", "4 Patch+Mayo", "1: Bup+MM", "2 Bup+Mayo", "3 Patch+MM", "4 Patch+Mayo"], "other_name": ["Nicoderm", "Zyban"], "criteria": "Light smokers (6-15 cigarettes per day Inclusion Criteria: Mentally and physically stable, non-pregnant, light smokers (6-15 cigarettes per day) Exclusion Criteria: Please contact site for more information", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "75 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "Accepts Healthy Volunteers", "keyword": "light smokers, smoking cessation treatment programs", "mesh_term": ["Tobacco Use Disorder", "Nicotine", "Bupropion"], "id": "NCT00086411"}
