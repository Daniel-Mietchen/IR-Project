{"brief_title": "Brain Imaging of Childhood Onset Psychiatric Disorders, Endocrine Disorders and Healthy Volunteers", "brief_summary": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) unlike X-rays and CT-scans does not use radiation to create a picture. MRI use as the name implies, magnetism to create pictures with excellent anatomical resolution. Functional MRIs are diagnostic tests that allow doctors to not only view anatomy, but physiology and function. It is for these reasons that MRIs are excellent methods for studying the brain. In this study, researchers will use MRI to assess brain anatomy and function in X and Y chromosome variation, healthy volunteers, and patients with a variety of childhood onset psychiatric disorders. The disorders include attention deficit disorder, autism, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, childhood-onset schizophrenia, dyslexia, obsessive compulsive disorder, Sydenham's chorea, and Tourette's syndrome. Results of the MRIs showing the anatomy of the brain and brain function will be compared across age, sex (gender), and diagnostic groups. Correlations between brain and behavioral measures will be examined for normal and clinical populations.", "detailed_description": "Driven by the hypotheses that many of the most severe neuropsychiatric disorders of childhood onset are associated with deviations from the path of normal brain development, the neuroanatomical substrates of which can be detected by magnetic resonance imaging, we are acquiring brain images in healthy and neuropsychiatrically impaired subjects. To explore gene, brain, behavior relationships in health and illness we are also acquiring DNA along with clinical, behavioral, and cognitive data in singleton and twin populations. Controls and clinical populations are screened and characterized in behavioral, cognitive, and physical domains. Longitudinal brain MRI scans are acquired and analyzed using state-of-the-art image analysis techniques. Data from the project has resulted in seminal papers on Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Childhood-Onset Schizophrenia, and normal pediatric brain development. The data from the normative project is unique in its longitudinal nature and sample size.", "condition": ["XXY (Klinefelter)", "Sex Chromosome Variation", "Sex Chromosome Aneuploidy", "XXXY", "XXXXXY", "XYY (Jacob)", "XXYY", "X (XO, Turner)", "XXX (Trisomy X, Triple X)", "XXXX (Tetrasomy X)", "XXXXX (Pentasomy X)"], "criteria": "- Description of study populations: Participants include typically developing subjects, subjects with a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions, and those with anomalous sex chromosome numbers or endocrine conditions. The accrual ceiling is 6,000. INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR HEALTHY CONTROLS: Subjects consenting to participation in the study Over 3 years of age with no upper limit for age at time of enrollment. ADDITIONAL INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR RETROSPECTIVE NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL DATA COLLECTION: INCLUSION CRITERIA: At least 18 years of age Previous qualifications as a healthy participant At least 3 high quality structural MRI scans between the ages of 7 and 30 years. Sufficient physical measures to ascertain growth during adolescence INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PATIENT POPULATIONS: Male and female subjects over 3 years of age with no upper limit for age (with the exception of the Down syndrome group see below). Currently meet criteria for at least one of the following: DSM-IV (or other approved) criteria for one of the following clinical diagnoses: Multi-Dimensionally Impaired, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Childhood Onset Schizophrenia, Turner Syndrome, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Asperger Syndrome, High Functioning Autism, Pervasive Development Disorder Sex chromosome aneuploidy as determined by karyotype (including XXX, XXXX, XXXXX, XXY, XXYY, XXXY, XXXXY, XYY). ICD-10 criteria for Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia, Cushings Syndrome, Kallmann Syndrome, normosmic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome ADHD Down s Syndrome Newly enrolled adults and minors once they become adults over age 18 who cannot give consent due to limited capacity may have a surrogate, i.e., a legally responsible representative (LAR), sign the consent. LARs include DPA holders, court-appointed legal guardians, or parents or siblings over 18 years of age. We will consult with the Human Subjects Protection Unit as necessary. ADDITIONAL INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR ADHD PARTICIPANTS: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) defined ADHD. The DSM-IV diagnosis of ADHD will be based on the Parent Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents. Conners Teacher Hyperactivity rating greater than 2 SD above age- and sex-specific means. ADDITIONAL INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR DOWN SYNDROME PARTICIPANTS: Confirmed chromosomal diagnosis of Down syndrome. Age at entry into the study is 30 years or under. ADDITIONAL INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PARTICIPANTS WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS: Meeting DSM-IV criteria for one of the pervasive developmental disorders (i.e., autistic disorder, Asperger disorder, or pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified). Having a minimum IQ of 70. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: NIMH staff and their immediate family are excluded from participation. EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR HEALTHY CONTROLS: Presence of any psychiatric disorder in the subject, sibling, or other first-degree relative. Current or past use of psychiatric medication. Special service needs in school. Presence or history of medical conditions known to affect cerebral anatomy. Dental braces. Metal in the body or other contraindications for MRI scanning. For females who have reached menarche: Pregnancy or inability or unwillingness to undergo pregnancy testing. ADDITIONAL EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR RETROSPECTIVE NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL DATA COLLECTION: Presence of any psychiatric disorder in the subject. Current or past use of psychiatric medication.
