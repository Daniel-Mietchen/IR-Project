{"brief_title": "Bortezomib in Treating Patients With Mantle Cell Lymphoma", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for cancer cell growth. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bortezomib in treating patients who have previously untreated or relapsed mantle cell lymphoma.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of bortezomib, in terms of response rate, in patients with previously untreated or relapsed mantle cell lymphoma. - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. - Correlate suppression of 20S proteasome levels with toxicity of and response to this drug in these patients. - Determine the time to progression and response duration in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, multicenter study. Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with complete response (CR) receive 2 courses beyond documentation of CR. Patients with stable disease receive a maximum of 4 courses. Patients with partial response (PR) continue therapy until disease progression or for 2 courses beyond documentation of stable PR. Patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months until disease progression. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24 months.", "condition": "Lymphoma", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "bortezomib", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically or cytologically confirmed relapsed or untreated mantle cell lymphoma - No refractory disease defined as progression while on chemotherapy or within 1 month after completion of chemotherapy - At least 1 bidimensionally measurable disease site* - Lymph nodes at least 1.5 cm by 1.5 cm by spiral CT scan OR - Non-nodal lesions (e.g., skin lesion or nodules) at least 1 cm by 1 cm by MRI, CT scan, or physical exam NOTE: *Bone lesions are not considered bidimensionally measurable disease - No pre-existing ascites or pleural effusion - No known CNS involvement by lymphoma PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 and over Performance status: - ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy: - At least 12 weeks Hematopoietic: - Absolute granulocyte count at least 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 75,000/mm^3 Hepatic: - Bilirubin no greater than 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) - AST or ALT no greater than 2.5 times ULN Renal: - Creatinine no greater than 1.5 times ULN Cardiovascular - LVEF at least 45% by echocardiogram or MUGA Pulmonary - No pre-existing shortness of breath greater than grade 1 Other: - No uncontrolled bacterial, fungal, or viral infections - No pre-existing edema greater than grade 1 - No pre-existing neuropathy greater than grade 1 - No other malignancy within the past 5 years except adequately treated nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix - No other serious illness or medical condition that would preclude study compliance - No geographical conditions that would preclude study compliance - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - See Chemotherapy - Prior rituximab allowed - No prior radioactive monoclonal antibody therapy Chemotherapy: - See Disease Characteristics - No prior high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplantation - No more than 2 prior systemic chemotherapy regimens - Same chemotherapy combination given for first-line and second-line therapy is considered 2 regimens - No prior flavopiridol - At least 6 weeks since prior chemotherapy - No concurrent cytotoxic chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: - No concurrent corticosteroids Radiotherapy: - No prior radiotherapy to 25% or more of functioning bone marrow - At least 4 weeks since prior radiotherapy (except low-dose nonmyelosuppressive radiotherapy) and recovered - No concurrent radiotherapy to the sole site of measurable disease Surgery: - At least 2 weeks since prior major surgery Other: - No prior investigational therapy - No other concurrent anticancer therapy - No other concurrent investigational anticancer therapy", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00030875.xml"}
