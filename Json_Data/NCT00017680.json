{"brief_title": "Study of High-Dose Melphalan and Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation in Patients With Primary Light Chain Amyloidosis", "brief_summary": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response, disease-free survival, and overall survival of patients with primary light chain amyloidosis treated with high-dose melphalan and autologous stem cell transplantation. II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.", "detailed_description": "PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients may receive induction chemotherapy before study entry. Patients then receive filgrastim (G-CSF) or another growth factor for 4-6 days as peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilization. PBSC (or bone marrow) is harvested over 2-3 days. Patients receive high-dose melphalan IV over 30 minutes twice daily on days -2 and -1. PBSC and/or bone marrow is reinfused on day 0. Patients receive G-CSF beginning on day 0 and continuing until blood counts recover. This course may be repeated 4-12 weeks later. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then annually for 5 years.", "condition": "Amyloidosis", "intervention_type": "Procedure", "intervention_name": "Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation", "description": "Bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cells harvested", "criteria": "PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA: Disease Characteristics - Histologically confirmed primary amyloidosis - Ineligible for other high priority national or international study Prior/Concurrent Therapy - Biologic therapy: Concurrent participation in gene therapy trials allowed - Chemotherapy: Prior chemotherapy allowed No other concurrent chemotherapy - Endocrine therapy: No concurrent steroids unless given with amphotericin B, for adrenal failure, or for septic shock No concurrent hormones except for non-disease-related conditions (e.g., insulin for diabetes) - Other: No concurrent barbiturates or acetaminophen Concurrent participation in supportive care trials allowed Patient Characteristics - Performance status: ECOG 0-3 - Hepatic: Bilirubin less than 2 times normal - Renal: Creatinine less than 2.5 mg/dL OR On stable hemodialysis - Pulmonary: DLCO at least 60% predicted OR Clearance by pulmonologist - Other: HIV negative", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "70 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00017680.xml"}
