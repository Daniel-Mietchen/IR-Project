{"brief_title": "A Study to Test the Effectiveness of Virulizin\u00ae Given in Combination With Standard Chemotherapy for Pancreatic Cancer", "brief_summary": "Virulizin is an immunotherapy drug preparation that is thought to stimulate the patient's immune system, which in turn may slow the growth of tumors. It is presented in vials as a sterile preparation for IM injection. The purpose of the trial is to investigate if Virulizin in combination with gemcitabine provides better efficacy than gemcitabine alone (with placebo) against pancreatic cancer.Virulizin\u00ae efficacy will continue to be assessed if chemotherapy is changed to 5-Fluorouracil.", "detailed_description": "A Phase III, Double-blind, Multicenter, Randomized Study in Chemonaive Patients with Locally Advanced or Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer to Compare a Combination Therapy of Virulizin\u00ae plus Gemcitabine versus Placebo plus Gemcitabine; Optional Secondline Therapy may Include Continuation of Virulizin\u00ae or Placebo, Alone or in Combination with 5-Fluorouracil. Patients who have not received any prior chemotherapy will be randomized to receive Gemcitabine plus Virulizin\u00ae versus Gemcitabine plus placebo in a double blind fashion. On disease progression patients may be switched to 5-Fluorouracil and continue to receive Virulizin\u00ae or placebo. Patients may continue Virulizin\u00ae alone, if clinically indicated when 5-Fluorouracil is discontinued.", "condition": "Pancreatic Cancer", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Virulizin\u00ae", "criteria": "- Patients with advanced (unresectable or metastatic) pancreatic adenocarcinoma (TNM stages II, III or IV) - No previous systemic chemotherapy(unless given as a radiosensitizer). - ECOG Performance Status 0-2 - Life expectancy equal to or greater than 12 weeks - Adequate laboratory and organ functions - Stabilizable pain (stable analgesic intake) - No radiotherapy during 4 weeks prior to trial entry - No evidence of ascites, pleural effusion or third space fluid accumulation - Not currently using, and have not used in 4 weeks prior to entering trial, systemic steroids or hormonal therapy", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00040092.xml"}
