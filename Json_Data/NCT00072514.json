{"brief_title": "Gemcitabine Hydrochloride, Carboplatin, Dexamethasone, and Rituximab in Treating Patients With Previously Treated Lymphoid Malignancies", "brief_summary": "This pilot phase II trial studies the side effects and how well giving gemcitabine hydrochloride, carboplatin, dexamethasone, and rituximab together works in treating patients with previously treated lymphoid malignancies. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride, carboplatin, and dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) and giving monoclonal antibody therapy with chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the feasibility and safety of Gemcitabine/Carboplatin/Dexamethasone with or without Rituximab in previously treated lymphoid malignancies (rituximab will only be evaluated in CD20 positive malignancies). II. To determine the efficacy of the above regimen. III. To determine the ability to proceed to blood stem peripheral blood collection following the above regimens (the impact of above regimen on stem cell reserve). IV. To determine remission duration. OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups. GROUP I: CD20-NEGATIVE LYMPHOMAS GROUP II: CD20-POSITIVE LYMPHOMAS After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3-4 weeks and then every 6 months for 5 years.", "condition": ["Adult Nasal Type Extranodal NK/T-cell Lymphoma", "Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma", "Angioimmunoblastic T-cell Lymphoma", "Cutaneous B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Extranodal Marginal Zone B-cell Lymphoma of Mucosa-associated Lymphoid Tissue", "Hepatosplenic T-cell Lymphoma", "Intraocular Lymphoma", "Nodal Marginal Zone B-cell Lymphoma", "Noncutaneous Extranodal Lymphoma", "Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Burkitt Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Diffuse Mixed Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Diffuse Small Cleaved Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Grade III Lymphomatoid Granulomatosis", "Recurrent Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Immunoblastic Large Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Lymphoblastic Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma", "Recurrent Cutaneous T-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Recurrent Grade 1 Follicular Lymphoma", "Recurrent Grade 2 Follicular Lymphoma", "Recurrent Grade 3 Follicular Lymphoma", "Recurrent Mantle Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Marginal Zone Lymphoma", "Recurrent Mycosis Fungoides/Sezary Syndrome", "Recurrent Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma", "Small Intestine Lymphoma", "Splenic Marginal Zone Lymphoma", "Testicular Lymphoma", "Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Drug", "Biological"], "intervention_name": ["gemcitabine hydrochloride", "carboplatin", "dexamethasone", "rituximab"], "description": ["Given IV", "Given IV", "Given PO", "Given IV in Group 2 only (CD20-POSITIVE LYMPHOMAS)"], "arm_group_label": ["Treatment", "Treatment", "Treatment", "Treatment"], "other_name": ["dFdC", "difluorodeoxycytidine hydrochloride", "gemcitabine", "Gemzar", "Carboplat", "CBDCA", "JM-8", "Paraplat", "Paraplatin", "Aeroseb-Dex", "Decaderm", "Decadron", "DM", "DXM", "IDEC-C2B8", "IDEC-C2B8 monoclonal antibody", "Mabthera", "MOAB IDEC-C2B8", "Rituxan"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Patients must have relapsed or primary refractory lymphoid malignancy (including B-cell, T-cell, or Hodgkin's Disease) - Revised European American classification (REAL), or World Health Organization (WHO) classification of patients malignancies must be provided - Patients must have measurable disease defined as lesions that can be accurately measured in two dimensions by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), medical photograph (skin or oral lesion), plain x-ray, or other conventional technique and a greatest transverse diameter of 1 cm or greater;
