{"brief_title": "ABX-EGF in Combination With Paclitaxel and Carboplatin for the Treatment of Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)", "brief_summary": "Rationale: Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been observed in kidney, prostate, colon, lung, breast, and other cancers, and is often associated with a poor prognosis. TGFa and EGF, the ligands for EGFR, are also overexpressed in some of these tumor types, suggesting a self-propagating stimulus that may be responsible for rapid tumor growth. Blocking this stimulus by blocking activation of EGFR with ABX-EGF, a fully human monoclonal antibody against EGFR, may prevent tumor growth and perhaps shrink tumors. Purpose: This is a Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ABX-EGF in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in the treatment of advanced NSCLC.", "condition": "Lung Cancer", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "carboplatin", "criteria": "For complete inclusion and exclusion criteria, please refer to the investigator.
