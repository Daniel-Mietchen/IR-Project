{"brief_title": "Lead Mobilization & Bone Turnover in Pregnancy/Lactation", "brief_summary": "We are examining the role of maternal bone lead turnover during pregnancy and lactation as a potential source of lead exposure for the fetus and the infant (via breast milk). A cohort, ascertained at entry to care, consists of >1000 women to be followed through pregnancy. In the postpartum subjects are recruited for a nested case control study to assess the influence of lactation on maternal bone density, maternal blood lead and breast milk lead.", "condition": ["Lead Poisoning"], "criteria": "1. Positive pregnancy test, age 12-35 and informed consent; 2. Gestation <28 weeks at entry to prenatal care; 3. No history of serious chronic or metabolic diseases, which could affect maternal growth or bone density; 4. Not corticosteroid user or diagnosed use of illicit drugs; 5. Eligible for lactation study: Ascertainment during or participation in the pregnancy study and a negative pregnancy test.", "gender": "Female", "minimum_age": "12 Years", "maximum_age": "35 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "Accepts Healthy Volunteers", "keyword": "Maternal-Fetal Exchange", "mesh_term": ["Poisoning", "Lead Poisoning"], "id": "NCT00011726"}
