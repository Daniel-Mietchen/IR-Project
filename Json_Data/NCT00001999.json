{"brief_title": "A Pilot Study to Obtain Preliminary Information Regarding the Efficacy and Safety of the Combination of Immune Globulin and Ganciclovir as Compared to Ganciclovir Alone in the Treatment of Sight-Threatening CMV Retinitis in Patients With AIDS", "brief_summary": "To evaluate whether immune globulin and ganciclovir (DHPG) results in faster initial response as compared to DHPG alone. To evaluate whether immune globulin and DHPG gives longer duration of remission than DHPG alone (i.e. 16 weeks). To evaluate the toxicities of the combination of DHPG and immune globulin as compared to those of DHPG alone. To evaluate if there is a difference between the two groups in regard to survival, immune functions, and CMV viremia and viruria.", "condition": ["Cytomegalovirus Retinitis", "HIV Infections"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Globulin, Immune", "Ganciclovir"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria Patients must have the following: - First episode of sight-threatening CMV retinitis. - At least one pending culture for CMV from the blood or urine prior to entry. - Life expectancy > 6 months. - Karnofsky performance = or > 60. - Ability to understand the nature of the study, to comply with study requirements, and to sign informed consent.
