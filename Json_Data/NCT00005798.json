{"brief_title": "Combination Chemotherapy Followed By Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation in Treating Women With Breast Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy followed by peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating women who have breast cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine long term remission rates as measured by disease free survival in women with breast cancer treated with cyclophosphamide, thiotepa, and carboplatin followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. II. Determine the safety and efficacy of this combination chemotherapy regimen in this patient population. OUTLINE: Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are collected. Patients sequentially receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour, thiotepa IV over 1 hour, and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on days -6 to -4. PBSC are reinfused on day 0. Patients are followed at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 40 patients with 4-9 positive lymph nodes and at least 50 patients with 10 positive lymph nodes will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Breast Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Carboplatin", "Cyclophosphamide", "Thiotepa"], "description": ["Carboplatin will be given at a dose of 267 mg/m2 in D5 W IV over one hour daily on days -6, -5, and -4.
