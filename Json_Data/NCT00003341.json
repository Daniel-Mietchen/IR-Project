{"brief_title": "Epoetin Alfa in Treating Anemia in Patients With Lymphoma, Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, or Multiple Myeloma and Anemia Caused By Chemotherapy", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs such as epoetin alfa may relieve anemia caused by chemotherapy. The best time for giving epoetin alfa during chemotherapy is not yet known. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to study the effectiveness of epoetin alfa in treating anemia in patients with lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or multiple myeloma who are receiving chemotherapy.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the hematologic response and transfusion requirements of patients with malignant lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or multiple myeloma with chemotherapy related moderate anemia treated with epoetin alfa. - Determine the effect of moderate anemia on quality of life of these patients treated with this regimen. - Correlate changes in quality of life with changes in anemia associated with treatment with epoetin alfa in these patients. - Determine the effect of changing quality of life on health care resource utilization among these patients treated with epoetin alfa. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open label, multicenter study. Patients are evaluated for anemia during their prescribed chemotherapy regimens at either 3 or 4 week intervals beginning week 3 or 4. Patients with hemoglobin levels of 10.0-12.0 g/dL are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Patients with hemoglobin levels greater than 12.0 g/dL are not randomized until their hemoglobin levels decrease to 12.0 g/dL or below. - Arm I: Patients immediately receive epoetin alfa subcutaneously each week. - Arm II: Patients are observed for 6-8 weeks and then hemoglobin levels are reevaluated. Patients whose hemoglobin levels decrease below 9.0 g/dL receive epoetin alfa subcutaneously each week. Patients whose hemoglobin levels are at least 9.0 g/dL are observed for another 3-4 weeks and then hemoglobin levels are reevaluated. Patients receive epoetin alfa treatment for up to 15 or 16 weeks. Qualify of life questionnaires are completed every 3 or 4 weeks until week 30 or 32. Patients are followed through week 36. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 275 patients (at least 130 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Anemia", "Leukemia", "Lymphoma", "Multiple Myeloma and Plasma Cell Neoplasm"], "intervention_type": ["Biological", "Procedure"], "intervention_name": ["epoetin alfa", "quality-of-life assessment"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or multiple myeloma - Low grade, intermediate grade, or high grade (diffuse large cell immunoblastic only) NHL OR - Histologically confirmed Hodgkin's disease with prior chemotherapy - Evaluable lesion - Must be scheduled for at least 1 myelosuppressive cytotoxic regimen (experimental chemotherapy regimens allowed) for at least 4-6 months - No anemia predominantly due to factors other than cancer or chemotherapy (i.e.,iron or folate deficiencies, hemolysis, or gastrointestinal bleeding) NOTE: A new classification scheme for adult non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ.
