{"brief_title": "Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage IV or Relapsed Malignant Melanoma", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Vaccines made from peptides may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy in treating patients who have stage IV, or relapsed malignant melanoma.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety of administering MART-1 peptide-pulsed dendritic cells to patients with stage IV or relapsed malignant melanoma. - Determine the immunological and clinical responses in this patient population after this therapy. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients undergo leukapheresis between days -14 to -8. Mononuclear cells are isolated, used to generate dendritic cells (DC), and then pulsed with MART-1 peptide. Patients are vaccinated with MART-1 peptide-pulsed DC either IV or intradermally on days 0, 14, and 28. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of MART-1 peptide-pulsed DC until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-24 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Melanoma"], "intervention_type": ["Biological", "Procedure"], "intervention_name": ["dendritic cell-MART-1 peptide vaccine", "leukapheresis"], "description": ["Number DC: dependent on the group route of immunization: dependent on the group subjects will receive 3 biweekly vaccinations. In case of grade III-IV toxicity in 1/3 subjects at any dose group or route, up to 6 subjects will be included in that group.", "Patients require a single leukapheresis to obtain 2x10^9 PBL, which are cryopreserved in RPMI 1640, 20% autologous serum, 10% DMSO. Aliquots are thawed at days -7, 7 and 21 for the first, second, and third immunizations respectively. Blood is drawn at the time of leukapheresis and on the day of the first vaccination for autologous serum, which is sufficient for the cell cultures of all patient groups."], "arm_group_label": ["Group A", "Group B", "Group C", "Group D", "Group E", "Group F", "Group A", "Group B", "Group C", "Group D", "Group E", "Group F"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Adults over the age of 18 with malignant melanoma. - HLA-A2.1 positive and express MART-1, as assessed by either RT-PCR or by immunohistochemistry - Tumor stages T3N0M0 or greater are eligible for this trial according to the following: 1.
