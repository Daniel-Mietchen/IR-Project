{"brief_title": "A Study to Assess Capecitabine (Xeloda\u00ae) in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer", "brief_summary": "This 2 arm study compared the efficacy and safety of label dose of capecitabine (Xeloda\u00ae) to that of a lower dose of Xeloda\u00ae plus docetaxel (Taxotere\u00ae) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of chemotherapy with an anthracycline. Patients were randomized to receive either 1250 mg/m^2 or 825 mg/m^2 orally twice a day (po bid) on days 1-14 of each 3 week cycle, in combination with Taxotere\u00ae 75 mg/m2 intravenous (iv) on day 1 of each 3 week cycle. The anticipated time on study treatment was until disease progression and the target sample size was 440 individuals.", "condition": ["Breast Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["capecitabine (Xeloda\u00ae)", "docetaxel (Taxotere\u00ae)"], "description": ["825 mg/m^2 or 1250 mg/m2 orally twice a day on days 1 to 14 of each 3 week cycle.", "75 mg/m^2 intravenous on day 1 of each 3 week cycle"], "arm_group_label": ["1250 mg/m^2 capecitabine + docetaxel", "825 mg/m^2 capecitabine + docetaxel", "1250 mg/m^2 capecitabine + docetaxel", "825 mg/m^2 capecitabine + docetaxel"], "other_name": ["Xeloda\u00ae", "Taxotere\u00ae"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - women >=18 years of age; - >=1 target lesion; - locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer; - demonstrated resistance to anthracycline; - >=2 regimens of chemotherapy for advanced/metastatic disease.
