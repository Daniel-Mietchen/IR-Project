{"brief_title": "Treatment Response to Rehabilitation in Patients With Schizophrenia", "brief_summary": "This study will examine the ways in which schizophrenia-related symptoms affect response to a rehabilitation program for people with schizophrenia.", "detailed_description": "Patients with schizophrenia often suffer neurocognitive impairment and psychosocial and vocational difficulties. This study will help identify those patients most likely to benefit from existing behavioral treatments and provide clues for how to modify treatments for those who do not benefit. Two studies will be conducted. The first will investigate the relationship of symptoms and neurocognitive variables at study entry to psychosocial and vocational status 2 years later. The second study will investigate the relationship of symptoms and neurocognitive variables at study entry to treatment response in patients assigned to either a cognitive remediation track or a computer skills track as part of their rehabilitation treatment. Both the cognitive remediation and computer skills training programs will last 4 to 6 months. Participants will be assessed pre- and post-treatment. Neuropsychological, psychosocial and vocational status will be measured.", "condition": "Schizophrenia", "intervention_type": "Behavioral", "intervention_name": "Computer-skills training", "description": "A computerized cognitive rehabilitation treatment with day-program activities", "arm_group_label": "2", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder - In need of intensive outpatient care - Treatment with atypical antipsychotic medication for a minimum of 6 months prior to study entry Exclusion Criteria: - Auditory or visual impairment - Mental retardation (IQ less than 70) - Traumatic brain injury with loss of consciousness - Presence or history of any neurological illness that may affect brain physiology - Lack of proficiency in English - Concurrent substance abuse and/or dependence", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00063336.xml"}
