{"brief_title": "A Phase III Study of Abatacept (BMS-188667) in Patients With Active Rheumatoid Arthritis and Inadequate Response to Methotrexate", "brief_summary": "Short Term: The purpose of this clinical research study is to learn if abatacept (BMS-188667) in combination with methotrexate is better than methotrexate alone in participants that have active rheumatoid arthritis and are not responding to methotrexate. The safety of this treatment will also be studied.
