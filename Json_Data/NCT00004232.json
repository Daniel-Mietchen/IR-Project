{"brief_title": "Bone Marrow and Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation in Treating Patients With Hematologic Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Bone marrow and peripheral stem cell transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy or radiation therapy used to kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of bone marrow and peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have hematologic cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the toxicity of unmanipulated bone marrow augmented with CD34+ enriched peripheral blood stem cells in patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing allogeneic transplantation. - Evaluate this treatment regimen in terms of kinetics of hematopoietic engraftment, infection, severity of graft-vs-host disease, relapse rate, and cost effectiveness in this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients undergo allogeneic transplantation comprising unmanipulated bone marrow with filgrastim (G-CSF)-mobilized, CD34+ enriched peripheral blood stem cells on day 0. Patients receive graft-vs-host disease prophylaxis comprising cyclosporine IV over 24 hours on day -1 and methylprednisolone IV or oral prednisone daily on days 7-65. Patients also receive G-CSF subcutaneously daily until blood counts recover. Patients are followed weekly for 3 months, at 6 months and 1 year, and then annually for 5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-60 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": "Precancerous/Nonmalignant Condition", "intervention_type": "Procedure", "intervention_name": "peripheral blood stem cell transplantation", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Diagnosed hematologic malignancy that is eligible for an active allogeneic bone marrow transplantation protocol and leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, and aplastic anemia treatment protocols - HLA-identical or one antigen-mismatched related donor PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 10 to 65 Performance status: - Not specified Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - Not specified Hepatic: - Not specified Renal: - Not specified Other: - No known sensitivity to E. coli derivatives PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: - See Disease Characteristics", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "10 Years", "maximum_age": "65 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00004232.xml"}
