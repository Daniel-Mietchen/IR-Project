{"brief_title": "The Safety and Effectiveness of Retrovir Plus HIVID Combined With Either Nevirapine or Invirase in the Treatment of HIV Infection", "brief_summary": "To evaluate the tolerance and immunologic and virologic effects of multidrug combinations of antiretrovirals in patients with HIV infection. Specifically, to evaluate zidovudine/zalcitabine ( AZT / ddC ) alone or in combination with either nevirapine or saquinavir ( Ro 31-8959 ). Administration of three-drug combinations for treatment of HIV infection is preferred over monotherapy or duotherapy. A system has been designed to rapidly evaluate current multidrug combinations of antiretrovirals and allow the addition of new agents as they become available.", "detailed_description": "Administration of three-drug combinations for treatment of HIV infection is preferred over monotherapy or duotherapy. A system has been designed to rapidly evaluate current multidrug combinations of antiretrovirals and allow the addition of new agents as they become available. Patients are randomized to receive AZT/ddC either alone or in combination with nevirapine or Ro 31-8959 for a minimum of 48 weeks. Patients are followed at weeks 2 and 4 and every 4 weeks thereafter.", "condition": ["HIV Infections"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Saquinavir", "Nevirapine", "Zidovudine", "Zalcitabine"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria Concurrent Medication: Encouraged: - PCP chemoprophylaxis for patients whose CD4 count falls below 200 cells/mm3 or who develop PCP on study.
