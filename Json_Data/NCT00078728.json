{"brief_title": "Family-Based Prevention Program for Childhood Anxiety", "brief_summary": "This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a short-term family-based program for preventing anxiety disorders in at-risk children.", "detailed_description": "Anxiety disorders are serious conditions that can negatively impact a person's overall functioning. This study will enroll mothers with anxiety disorders and their children to determine whether a brief family-based intervention will reduce childhood anxiety better than standard care. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the family-based prevention program or to evaluation only for 8 weeks. Participants in the prevention program will have weekly sessions with a therapist and will learn skills to help reduce anxiety. Self- and parent-reports, diagnostic interviews, a computerized memory task, and a videotaped parent-child interaction task will be used to assess participants. Assessments will be conducted at study start and one week after intervention completion (Week 9). Follow-up visits will be conducted at 6 and 12 months after intervention completion.", "condition": ["Anxiety Disorders"], "intervention_type": ["Behavioral", "Behavioral"], "intervention_name": ["Family-Based Anxiety Prevention Program", "Evaluation only"], "description": ["Participants in the prevention program will have weekly sessions with a therapist and will learn skills to help reduce anxiety for 8 weeks.
