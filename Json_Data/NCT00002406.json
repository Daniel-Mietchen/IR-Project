{"brief_title": "A Comparison of Two Dose Levels of Indinavir Combined With Two Nucleoside Analogue Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) in HIV-Infected Patients", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to determine if two dose levels of indinavir combined with two nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) have the same effect on plasma viral load (level of HIV in the blood).", "detailed_description": "In this open-label study 350 seropositive HIV-1 men and women are first stratified according to baseline plasma viral RNA (less than 400 copies/mL vs negative plasma viral RNA result) then randomized into one of two arms: Arm 1: Indinavir (800 mg, q8h) plus two pre-existing NRTIs. Arm 2: Indinavir (1,200 mg, q12h) plus two pre-existing NRTIs. Plasma viral RNA will be measured every 4 weeks for the duration of the 24-week study.", "condition": "HIV Infections", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Indinavir sulfate", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria Patients must have: - Documented HIV-1 seropositive status. - CD4 count greater than 100 cells/mm3. - Parental consent for patients under 18.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "16 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00002406.xml"}
