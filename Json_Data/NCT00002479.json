{"brief_title": "Tretinoin in Treating Patients With Mycosis Fungoides or Sezary Syndrome", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of tretinoin in treating patients who have any stage mycosis fungoides or Sezary syndrome.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of tretinoin (TRA) in patients with mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome. II. Evaluate the spectrum of toxicity of TRA in this patient population. OUTLINE: Nonrandomized study. Single-agent Chemotherapy. Tretinoin, All-trans-Retinoic Acid, TRA, NSC-122758. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: If 1 or more of the first 15 evaluable patients experience an objective response, then 20 additional patients will be entered.
