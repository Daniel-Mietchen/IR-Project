{"brief_title": "COL-3 in Treating Patients With Progressive or Recurrent Brain Tumors", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: COL-3 may stop the growth of brain tumors by stopping blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of COL-3 in treating patients who have progressive or recurrent brain tumors following radiation therapy or chemotherapy.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose, dose limiting toxicity, and safety profile of oral COL-3 alone or when combined with anticonvulsants known to be metabolized by CYP450 in patients with progressive or recurrent high grade anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, or glioblastoma multiforme. - Define the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of COL-3 on this schedule and determine the effects of hepatic enzyme inducing drugs, such as anticonvulsants, on the pharmacokinetics. - Determine the response rate, disease free survival, and survival in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study of COL-3. Patients are stratified by anticonvulsant (anticonvulsants that cause induction of CYP450 vs anticonvulsants that cause modest or no induction of CYP450 or no anticonvulsant). - Phase I: Patients receive oral COL-3 daily. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of COL-3 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. - Phase II: Patients receive oral COL-3 daily at the MTD from the phase I portion of this study. Patients are followed every 2 months until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-18 patients will be accrued for phase I of the study and a total of 35 patients will be accrued for phase II of the study at a rate of 3 patients per month.", "condition": "Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "incyclinide", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically proven high grade glioma that is progressive or recurrent following radiotherapy or chemotherapy - Anaplastic astrocytoma - Anaplastic oligodendroglioma - Glioblastoma multiforme - Prior low grade glioma that has progressed to high grade glioma following radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy allowed - Measurable disease by MRI or CT scan PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 and over Performance status: - Karnofsky 60-100% Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - Absolute neutrophil count at least 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 100,000/mm^3 Hepatic: - Bilirubin normal - SGOT or SGPT no greater than 2.5 times upper limit of normal Renal: - Creatinine no greater than 1.5 mg/dL OR - Creatinine clearance greater than 60 mL/min Cardiovascular: - No myocardial infarction, stroke, or congestive heart failure within the past 3 months Other: - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception during and for 1 month after study - No serious active infection or medical illness that would preclude compliance - HIV negative - No history of gastrointestinal disorders that would interfere with absorption of study drug - No other malignancy within the past 5 years except curatively treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast, or basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer - No hypersensitivity to tetracyclines or its derivatives PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - No concurrent filgrastim (G-CSF) Chemotherapy: - At least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy (6 weeks since prior nitrosoureas) and recovered - No more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens Endocrine therapy: - Not specified Radiotherapy: - No prior large field radiotherapy (greater than 20% of total bone marrow) - At least 3 months since other prior radiotherapy and recovered Surgery: - No prior major upper gastrointestinal surgery - At least 14 days since other prior major surgery Other: - No other concurrent investigational agents - No prolonged sun exposure", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00004147.xml"}
