Exclusion Criteria Co-existing Condition: Patients with the following symptoms and conditions are excluded: - Neuropathy due to any other cause besides HIV infection. - Any symptom consistent with a new or active underlying opportunistic infection or malignancy that could interfere with the evaluation of neuropathy. - Clinical evidence of new or active CNS disease, potentially from opportunistic infection or neoplasm resulting from HIV infections, that could interfere with the evaluation of neuropathy. - Other CNS disease (e.g., myelopathy) that could complicate the evaluation of neuropathy. - Active life-threatening illness other than AIDS. Concurrent Medication: Excluded: - Dapsone. - Hydralazine. - Isoniazid (INH). - Current use of tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants, or clonidine unless the patient has used the drug without a change in dose for at least 3 months prior to study entry. - Narcotics, unless the patient has been using them for at least 6 weeks prior to study entry. Prior Medication: Excluded: - ddI or ddC in the past 8 weeks. - Prior peptide T. - Prior tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants, or clonidine unless they have been used for at least 3 months without change in dose. - Other investigational drugs within the past 30 days. Required: - Zidovudine (if intolerance not demonstrated). Required: - Zidovudine for at least the previous 3 months (unless patient has demonstrated intolerance to zidovudine). Chronic alcohol abuse, or current abuse of psychoactive recreational drugs as defined in DSM IIIR.
