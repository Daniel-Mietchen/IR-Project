{"brief_title": "Docetaxel in Treating Children With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic or Acute Myeloid Leukemia", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of docetaxel in treating children who have relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic or acute myeloid leukemia.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic or acute myeloid leukemia treated with docetaxel. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for a maximum of 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-20 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.", "condition": ["Leukemia"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["docetaxel"], "description": ["Continuous IV infusion"], "arm_group_label": ["Relapsed or Refractory ALL, AML"], "other_name": ["Taxotere\u00ae", "NSC #628503"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed acute lymphoblastic or acute myeloid leukemia - M3 bone marrow relapse required - Refractory to conventional chemotherapy - No extramedullary disease at relapse PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 21 and under at time of initial diagnosis Performance status: - ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy: - At least 2 months Hematopoietic: - Not specified Hepatic: - Bilirubin no greater than 1.5 mg/dL - AST and ALT no greater than 1.5 times normal - Alkaline phosphatase no greater than 2.5 times normal Renal: - Creatinine no greater than 1.5 times normal OR - Creatinine clearance or radioisotope glomerular filtration rate at least 70 mL/min Other: - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - At least 7 days since prior biologic therapy and recovered - At least 6 months since prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation - No concurrent immunomodulating agents during first 2 courses of therapy - No concurrent routine filgrastim (G-CSF) Chemotherapy: - See Disease Characteristics - At least 2 weeks since prior chemotherapy (4 weeks for nitrosoureas) and recovered - No prior paclitaxel or docetaxel - No other concurrent chemotherapy during first 2 courses of therapy Endocrine therapy: - No concurrent corticosteroid therapy except dexamethasone, low-dose hydrocortisone to treat allergic reactions, or treatment for adrenal crisis Radiotherapy: - Recovered from prior radiotherapy - At least 2 weeks since prior palliative local radiotherapy - At least 6 months since prior craniospinal radiotherapy or radiotherapy to at least 50% of the pelvis - At least 6 weeks since prior substantial bone marrow radiotherapy - No concurrent radiotherapy Surgery: - Not specified", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "21 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "childhood acute promyelocytic leukemia (M3)", "mesh_term": ["Leukemia", "Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute", "Docetaxel"], "id": "NCT00021242"}
