{"brief_title": "Genetic Risk Factors for Severe Asthma", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to determine whether a specific genetic factor influences the severity of asthma symptoms.", "detailed_description": "Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in the United States. It is well known that asthma susceptibility is inherited; however, it is unknown if asthma severity is heritable. Studies suggest that levels of interleukin-16 (IL-16) may influence asthma severity. This study will examine the role of differences in the control region of the IL-16 gene in a racially diverse group of asthmatics and nonasthmatics and will determine if the IL-16 gene control region is related to asthma severity. Participants in this study will undergo lung function and blood tests; they will also complete a questionnaire about their respiratory health. Asthmatic participants will complete a severity-of-asthma questionnaire.", "condition": ["Asthma"], "study_pop": "\n      ", "sampling_method": "Non-Probability Sample", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria for Asthmatic Participants: - Diagnosis of asthma Inclusion Criteria for Non-asthmatic Participants: - No diagnosis of asthma", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "44 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "mesh_term": ["Asthma"], "id": "NCT00090740"}
