{"brief_title": "Diet/Growth Factor Mechanisms of Gut Adaptation", "brief_summary": "This is a double-blind randomized controlled study on the clinical and metabolic effects and underlying gut mucosal mechanisms of modified diet, with or without recombinant human growth hormone, in adults with severe short bowel syndrome dependent upon parenteral nutrition. Clinical endpoints include ability to wean patients from parenteral feeding, metabolic endpoints include gut nutrient absorptive function and molecular endpoints include expression of growth factors and nutrient transporters in small bowel and colonic mucosa. The 6-month study is performed, in part, in the General Clinical Research Center for inpatient stays and outpatient visits.", "detailed_description": "This is a double-blind randomized controlled study on the clinical and metabolic effects and underlying gut mucosal mechanisms of modified diet, with or without recombinant human growth hormone, in adults with severe short bowel syndrome dependent upon parenteral nutrition.
