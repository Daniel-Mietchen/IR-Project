{"brief_title": "ISIS 2503 in Treating Patients With Advanced Cancer of the Pancreas", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of ISIS 2503 in treating patients who have advanced cancer of the pancreas.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate and time to progression in patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas who are treated with ISIS 2503. II. Determine the duration of response in these patients receiving this regimen. III. Characterize the safety profile of ISIS 2503 at the recommended phase II dose and schedule in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive ISIS 2503 IV continuously for 14 days. Treatment continues every 21 days for a minimum of 3 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-27 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months.", "condition": "Pancreatic Cancer", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "ISIS 2503", "description": "Beginning dosage of ISIS 2503 is 6 mg/kg/day given as a continuous i.v. infusion over the first 14 days of a 21-day treatment cycle.
