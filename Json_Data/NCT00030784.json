{"brief_title": "Liposomal Doxorubicin Plus Ifosfamide in Treating Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Soft Tissue Sarcoma", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining liposomal doxorubicin with ifosfamide in treating patients who have advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of ifosfamide in combination with doxorubicin HCl liposome in patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma. - Determine the objective response in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the dose-limiting toxicity in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of ifosfamide. Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome IV over 1 hour on day 1 and ifosfamide IV over 4 hours on days 1-3 OR on days 1-4 (for patients enrolled on dose level 6). Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of ifosfamide until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 8 weeks until disease progression and then every 12 weeks thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-24 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": "Sarcoma", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed soft tissue sarcoma - Advanced and/or metastatic disease - Must be of any of the following types: - Malignant fibrous histiocytoma - Liposarcoma (excluding lipomas and well-differentiated liposarcomas) - Rhabdomyosarcoma - Synovial sarcoma - Malignant paraganglioma - Fibrosarcoma - Leiomyosarcoma - Angiosarcoma - Neurogenic sarcoma - Sarcoma not otherwise specified - Paraffin blocks and slides must be available - Measurable disease - Osseous lesions and pleural effusions are not considered measurable disease - Evidence of progressive disease within the past 6 weeks - The following conditions are excluded: - Gastrointestinal stromal tumors - Malignant mesothelioma - Chondrosarcoma - Neuroblastoma - Osteosarcoma - Ewing's sarcoma - Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma - No symptomatic or known CNS metastases PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 to 70 Performance status: - WHO 0-1 Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - WBC at least 4,000/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 100,000/mm^3 Hepatic: - Bilirubin no greater than 1.75 mg/dL - Albumin at least 2.5 g/dL Renal: - Creatinine no greater than 1.4 mg/dL - Creatinine clearance at least 65 mL/min Cardiovascular: - Ejection fraction at least 50% by echocardiogram or isotopic methods - No history of cardiovascular disease Other: - No other prior or concurrent primary malignancies except adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix or basal cell carcinoma - No other severe medical illness - No psychosis - No psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical condition that would preclude study participation - Not pregnant - Fertile patients must use effective contraception (barrier method for men) during and for 6 months after study participation PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - Not specified Chemotherapy: - No prior chemotherapy for advanced disease - No other concurrent systemic chemotherapy for malignancy Endocrine therapy: - Not specified Radiotherapy: - No prior radiotherapy to sole indicator lesion - Concurrent radiotherapy allowed except to sole indicator lesion Surgery: - Not specified Other: - No other concurrent investigational drugs", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "70 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00030784.xml"}
