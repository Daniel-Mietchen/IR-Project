{"brief_title": "Effects of Talampanel on Patients With Advanced Parkinson's Disease", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this research study is to test the safety and effectiveness of the study drug, Talampanel, when used to treat patients with involuntary movements known as dyskinesias, as a result of treatment to Parkinson's disease. It is not clear why people with Parkinson's disease develop involuntary movements (dyskinesias) but studies show that blocking receptors in the brain for a chemical called glutamate decreases these movements. Talampanel is a drug which blocks these receptors.", "condition": "Movement Disorders", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "talampanel", "description": "75mg per day divided into 3 doses for 22 days", "arm_group_label": "2", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Troublesome on-period dyskinesias as defined by a Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) dyskinesia sub-score >25% of Duration of dyskinesia during waking hours and 33 must have moderate disability - Lang-Fahn dyskinesia rating score more than 2 for at least two of the 5 tasks - Must have Dyskinesia on average 25% of waking hours/day based on Patient Diaries - Have been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease > 5 years at Screening Exclusion Criteria: - Previous surgical therapies for PD - Isolated or predominantly diphasic dyskinesias - Moderate Dementia - On disallowed concomitant medications including CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers, amantadine, etc.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "40 Years", "maximum_age": "85 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00036296.xml"}
