Exclusion Criteria: Patients fulfilling any of the following criteria should not be enrolled in the study: - Previous myelosuppressive chemotherapy within the past 4 weeks of the start of the infusion. Patients who have received more than two chemotherapy regimens (single therapy or combination therapy) are ineligible. - Any form of brain radiation within 10 weeks of the start of the infusion. - Previous gamma knife radiosurgery, stereotactic radiosurgery, and/or internal radiotherapy, unless the recurrence/progression is histologically confirmed (fine-needle biopsy). - Prior intracavitary biologic response modifiers or monoclonal antibodies. - Uncontrolled seizures. - Bilateral or multifocal tumors. - Evidence of cerebral uncal herniation. - Midline brain shift on MRI scan of > 0.5 cm prior to resection; patients with subfalcine herniation may be enrolled. - Tumors involving the brainstem or cerebellum. - Diffuse subependymal or CSF disease. - Women who are pregnant or breast feeding. All women of child-bearing potential should be excluded unless they have a negative pregnancy test and are using adequate contraceptive measures or are surgically sterile. Post-menopausal women must be amenorrhoeic for at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing. - Fertile males not practicing adequate contraception and whose female partners are not using adequate contraceptive protection. - Prior or concurrent investigational treatment within 30 days of study entry. - Active infection requiring treatment or having an unexplained febrile illness. - Systemic diseases or other conditions which may be associated with unacceptable anesthetic/operative risk and/or which would not allow safe completion of this study protocol. - Prior or concurrent malignancy (curatively treated carcinoma-in-situ or basal cell carcinoma or patients who have been disease free for at least 5 years are eligible).", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00071539.xml"}
