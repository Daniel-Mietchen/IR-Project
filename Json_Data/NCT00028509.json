PURPOSE: Clinical trial to compare brain function of children who have been previously treated with methotrexate.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Compare the incidence of neuropsychological abnormalities and leukoencephalopathy in children previously treated with methotrexate on protocols POG-9605 versus POG-9201. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. More than 3 years after completion of therapy, patients undergo 9 different tests to assess intelligence, memory, learning, attention, concentration, processing of information, functioning, and visual-motor integration. Patients also undergo MRI of the head. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-54 patients previously treated on protocol POG-9201 will be accrued for this study. A total of 60-108 patients previously treated on protocol POG-9605 will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Long-term Effects Secondary to Cancer Therapy in Children", "Neurotoxicity"], "intervention_type": ["Procedure"], "intervention_name": ["management of therapy complications"], "study_pop": "\n      ", "sampling_method": "Non-Probability Sample", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Previously enrolled on POG-9201 or POG-9605 - Good prognosis by NCI risk (9201 and 9605 stratum 1) - Eligible for the therapeutic study - Completed therapy by 12/31/2000 - No CNS3 at diagnosis - No relapsed disease PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 1 to 9 at diagnosis Performance status: - Not specified Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - Not specified Hepatic: - Not specified Renal: - Not specified Other: - No Down syndrome PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - Not specified Chemotherapy - Not specified Endocrine therapy - Not specified Radiotherapy - Not specified Surgery - Not specified Other - See Disease Characteristics", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "1 Year", "maximum_age": "9 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "long-term effects secondary to cancer therapy in children", "mesh_term": ["Neurotoxicity Syndromes"], "id": "NCT00028509"}
