{"brief_title": "Genetic Study of Newly Diagnosed Central Nervous System Tumors in Young Children", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Genetic studies may help in understanding the genetic processes involved in the development of some types of cancer. PURPOSE: Genetic study to learn more about genes involved in the development of central nervous system tumors in young children.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Identify known genes that have significantly different levels of expression, using microarray gene chip analysis, in infants with newly diagnosed metastatic vs non-metastatic embryonal central nervous system tumors. - Determine the protein expression of genes identified by microarray analysis that are involved in cellular functions that regulate angiogenesis, invasion, or metastasis in this patient population. - Determine the quantity of gene expression of the confirmed translationally expressed genes using semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Tumor samples are analyzed using microarray gene chip analysis. Differentially expressed genes are evaluated for protein expression by standard immunohistochemistry and/or Western blot analysis, and gene expression is further quantified by semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 80-100 patients (20-25 with metastatic disease and 60-75 with non-metastatic disease) will be accrued for this study within 4-5 years.", "condition": ["Central Nervous System Embryonal Neoplasm"], "study_pop": "\n      ", "sampling_method": "Non-Probability Sample", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed, newly diagnosed, primary intracranial embryonal central nervous system tumor - Medulloblastoma - Primitive neuroectodermal tumor - Medulloepithelioma - Ependymoblastoma - Neuroblastoma - Pineoblastoma - Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor - Intracranial germ cell tumor - Choroid plexus carcinoma - M positive ependymoma - Potential enrollment on PBTC-001 therapeutic protocol PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - Under 3 Performance status: - Not specified Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - Not specified Hepatic: - Not specified Renal: - Not specified PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - Not specified Chemotherapy: - No prior chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: - Prior steroids allowed Radiotherapy: - No prior radiotherapy Surgery: - Not specified Other: - No concurrent investigational agents", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "2 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "newly diagnosed childhood ependymoma", "mesh_term": ["Nervous System Neoplasms", "Central Nervous System Neoplasms", "Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal"], "id": "NCT00010114"}
