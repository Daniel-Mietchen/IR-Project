{"brief_title": "Antineoplaston Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage IV Adrenal Gland Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Antineoplastons are naturally-occurring substances that may also be made in the laboratory. Antineoplastons may inhibit the growth of cancer cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well antineoplaston therapy works in treating patients with stage IV adrenal gland cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety and possible effectiveness of antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 in patients with stage IV adrenal gland carcinoma. - Determine the tolerance to and side effects of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the response in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: Patients receive gradually escalating doses of antineoplaston A10 and antineoplaston AS2-1 IV over a minimum of 1 hour 6 times daily until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Treatment continues for at least 3 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients achieving complete response (CR) continue treatment for an additional 8 months after reaching CR. Patients are followed every 2 months for the first year and then every 3 months for the second year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Adrenocortical Carcinoma"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["antineoplaston A10", "antineoplaston AS2-1"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed stage IV adrenal gland carcinoma that is unlikely to respond to existing therapy and for which no curative therapy exists - Measurable disease by MRI or CT scan - Tumor must be greater than 2 cm at the largest diameter for the lymph nodes located in the head, neck, axillary, inguinal, or femoral areas and at least 0.5 cm in the largest diameter for other localizations PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 6 months and over Performance status: - Karnofsky 60-100% Life expectancy: - At least 2 months Hematopoietic: - WBC at least 2,000/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 50,000/mm^3 Hepatic: - Bilirubin no greater than 2.5 mg/dL - SGOT/SGPT no greater than 5 times upper limit of normal - No hepatic failure Renal: - Creatinine no greater than 2.5 mg/dL - No history of renal conditions that contraindicate high dosages of sodium Cardiovascular: - No severe heart disease - No uncontrolled hypertension - No history of congestive heart failure - No history of other cardiovascular conditions that contraindicate high dosages of sodium Pulmonary: - No severe lung disease Other: - Not pregnant or nursing - Fertile patients must use effective contraception during and for 4 weeks after study participation - No serious active infections or fever - No other concurrent serious disease PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - At least 4 weeks since prior immunotherapy and recovered - No concurrent immunomodulating agents Chemotherapy: - At least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy (6 weeks for nitrosoureas) and recovered - No concurrent antineoplastic agents Endocrine therapy: - Concurrent corticosteroids allowed Radiotherapy: - At least 8 weeks since prior radiotherapy and recovered Surgery: - Recovered from any prior operative procedure Other: - No prior antineoplaston therapy - Prior cytodifferentiating agent allowed", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "recurrent adrenocortical carcinoma", "mesh_term": ["Carcinoma", "Adrenocortical Carcinoma"], "id": "NCT00003453"}
