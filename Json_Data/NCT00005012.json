{"brief_title": "Safety and Effectiveness of PEG-Intron in HIV-Infected Patients", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to see if it is effective to give PEG-Intron (PEG-IFN) to HIV-infected patients who are not doing well with their current anti-HIV drug combination (HAART).", "detailed_description": "At entry, patients undergo HIV genotypic/phenotypic analysis. Patients continue their current antiretroviral regimen but are randomized to receive one of four doses of PEG-IFN or PEG-IFN placebo administered subcutaneously once per week until results of HIV genotyping/phenotyping are available (approximately 4 weeks). Patients who respond with a 0.5 log or greater decrease in HIV RNA at Week 4 have optimized HAART added to their ongoing PEG-IFN regimen and are followed for 24 weeks in an observational study.", "condition": "HIV Infections", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Peginterferon alfa-2b", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria Patients may be eligible for this study if they: - Have HIV levels of more than 2000 copies/ml. - Have failed their current HAART (had a significant increase in their HIV levels with HAART). - Have a CD4 cell count greater than 200 cells/microL. - Have had more than 6 months of HAART. - Have been on their current HAART for at least 6 weeks. - Agree to use an effective method of birth control during the study.
