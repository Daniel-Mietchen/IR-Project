{"brief_title": "Walking Therapy In Hemiparetic Stroke Patients Using Robotic-Assisted Treadmill Training", "brief_summary": "The overall goal of this study is to determine whether robotic-assisted gait training is better than standard physical therapy treatments for improving walking ability in hemiparetic stroke patients.", "detailed_description": "Subjects enrolled into the study will be randomly assigned to one of 2 groups. The first group will receive one hour of conventional gait training, consisting of lower extremity strengthening exercises, stretching, and full weight bearing walking as tolerated, with appropriate physical assistance from a therapist. The second group will receive walking therapy using a Lokomat, which is a special treadmill that works in conjunction with 2 light-weight robotic arms that assists the subject to move their legs while they try to walk on the treadmill. Some of the subject\u2019s body-weight will be supported using a harness. During Lokomat training sessions, subjects will receive feedback of their walking performance on a computer monitor to help them walk. Both groups will be trained for 8-10 weeks, 3 times per week, for 1 hour training sessions (24 total sessions). Resources for transportation to the National Rehabilitation Hospital will be provided to all study participants.", "condition": ["Hemiparesis", "Stroke"], "intervention_type": ["Device"], "intervention_name": ["Lokomat (Robotic Orthosis) combined with slat belt treadmill"], "criteria": "Inclusion: - Unilateral brain lesion. - Within 6 months post-stroke. - Receiving no other therapy targeting function of lower limb. - Demonstration of hemiparesis (motor dysfunction in lower limb). - Able to walk 5 meters without therapist assistance (walking device only). - Able to follow commands and protocol.
