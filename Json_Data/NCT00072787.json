{"brief_title": "Phase 1/2 Study of S-1 and Cisplatin in Advanced Gastric Cancer", "brief_summary": "The purpose of the phase 1 portion of the study is to determine the safe dose of S-1 and cisplatin that can be administered in gastric cancer patients. The purpose of the phase 2 portion of the study is to determine the antitumor activity of the S-1 and cisplatin regimen established from phase 1 in patients with advanced gastric cancer.", "detailed_description": "S-1 is an oral fluoropyrimidine which combines tegafur (a 5-FU prodrug) with two classes of modulators which: - inhibit dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) and - block phosphorylation of 5-FU in gastrointestinal tissues. S-1 is designed to enhance the the clinical utility of an oral fluoropyrimidine while ameliorating the disadvantage of gastrointestinal toxicity. 5-Fu and cisplatin have been used as a standard treatment in gastric cancer and preliminary data indicate that S-1 plus cisplatin may result in superior tolerability and efficacy in advanced gastric cancer. S-1 is currently approved in Japan for treatment of gastric cancer and head and neck cancer.", "condition": "Gastric Cancer", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "cisplatin", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria - Has histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction - Has advanced, unresectable cancer at the time of study entry - Has measurable disease as defined by RECIST criteria, i.e., lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with the longest diameter \u226520 mm using conventional techniques or \u226510 mm using spiral CT scan - Is at least 3 weeks post-gastrectomy surgery - Has not received prior chemotherapy for their cancer (adjuvant therapy is permitted and does not count as prior chemotherapy). - Has performance status of \u2265 70% on the Karnofsky scale (Appendix B) - Has a predicted life expectancy of \u2265 12 weeks - Has an absolute granulocyte count of \u2265 1,500/mm3 - Has a platelet count \u2265 100,000/mm3 - Has a hemoglobin of \u2265 9.0 g/dL - Has a bilirubin of \u2264 1.5 times the ULN - Has transaminases \u2264 2.5 times the ULN except for patients with liver metastasis who may have transaminases \u2264 5 times the ULN - Has a creatinine \u2264 ULN and calculated creatinine \u2265 60 mL/min - According to the judgment of the Investigator, the patient has recovered from all previous anti-cancer treatment-related toxicities to at least Grade 1 (see exceptions above) - Has stopped all previous investigational drugs at least 4 weeks prior to treatment with S-1 and cisplatin. - Is able to take medications orally - Female patients of childbearing potential who are not pregnant and who use acceptable means of contraception while on study and for an additional 30 days after the last dose of study medication.
