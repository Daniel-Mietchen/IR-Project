Excess adiposity is more than just a cosmetic problem, having substantial metabolic consequences. Insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, impaired glucose tolerance, and frank diabetes are often seen in obese children. In this study the prevalence of impaired glucose (carbohydrate) tolerance in lean children with a family history of diabetes and obese children with acanthosis nigricans with or without a family history of diabetes mellitus will be studied.", "condition": ["Obesity", "Glucose Intolerance", "Diabetes", "Acanthosis Nigricans"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Obesity: BM +/- 95% for age general good health", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "8 Years", "maximum_age": "18 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "Accepts Healthy Volunteers", "mesh_term": ["Glucose Intolerance", "Acanthosis Nigricans"], "id": "NCT00000112"}
