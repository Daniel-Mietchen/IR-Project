{"brief_title": "Lenalidomide Safety/Efficacy in Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) Associated With a Deletion (Del)(5q) Cytogenetic Abnormality", "brief_summary": "This study is a multicenter, single-arm, open-label study of oral lenalidomide monotherapy administered to red blood cell (RBC) transfusion-dependent subjects with low- or intermediate-1-risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) associated with a del (5q31-33) cytogenetic abnormality. Screening procedures will take place within 28 days of the first day of lenalidomide treatment. Subjects will receive lenalidomide in 28-day cycles for up to 6 cycles, or until bone marrow disease progression or progression/relapse following erythroid hematologic improvement is documented. Study visits will occur every cycle (every 28 days) and laboratory monitoring to assess hematological parameters will occur every 14 days. Safety and efficacy assessments to be performed during the study are outlined in the Schedule of Study Assessments.", "condition": "Myelodysplastic Syndromes", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "lenalidomide", "description": "10 mg orally once daily for 21 days out of a 28-day cycle (syncopated); subsequently amended (Amendment 1, dated 27 August 2003) to employ a continuous dosage regimen in which 10 mg was taken once daily for 28 day cycles (continuous). Subjects who initially began a syncopated regimen and who did not experience a dose-limiting adverse event were allowed to switch to the continuous regimen.", "arm_group_label": "Lenalidomide", "other_name": "CC-5013", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Must understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent form - Age 18 years or older at the time of signing the informed consent - Must be able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements. - Diagnosis of low or intermediate-1-risk International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) without an abnormality of chromosome 5 involving a deletion between bands q31 and q33. - Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion-dependent anemia defined as having received greater than or equal to 2 units of RBCs within 8 weeks of the first day of study drug treatment. - Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0, 1 or 2. - Women of childbearing potential (WCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days of starting study drug. - Sexually active WCBP must agree to use adequate contraceptive methods (oral, injectable, or implantable hormonal contraceptive; tubal ligation; intra-uterine device; barrier contraceptive with spermicide; or vasectomized partner) while on study drug. - WCBP must agree to have pregnancy tests every 4 weeks while on study drug.
