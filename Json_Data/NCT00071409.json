{"brief_title": "Safety and Efficacy of INGAP-Peptide in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes", "brief_summary": "Insulin is a chemical that the body needs in order to use or store sugar. It is made by a type of cell called a beta cell which resides in an organ known as the pancreas. Type 1 diabetes is a disease where the beta cells have been destroyed so that little or no insulin is made. Sugar levels rise in the blood as a result. INGAP-Peptide is being tested to attempt to create new beta cells in the pancreas, and to restore the ability to produce insulin in type 1 diabetic patients.", "condition": "Diabetes Mellitus, Insulin-Dependent", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "placebo", "description": "1.5 mL, once daily, self-administered SC injection for 90 days", "arm_group_label": "placebo", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria - Age 18-65 - fasting C-peptide <0.3 ng/ml. - HbA1c <10% - history of onset of type 1 DM at or before 20 years of age. - Otherwise healthy", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "65 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00071409.xml"}
