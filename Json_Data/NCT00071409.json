{"brief_title": "Safety and Efficacy of INGAP-Peptide in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes", "brief_summary": "Insulin is a chemical that the body needs in order to use or store sugar. It is made by a type of cell called a beta cell which resides in an organ known as the pancreas. Type 1 diabetes is a disease where the beta cells have been destroyed so that little or no insulin is made. Sugar levels rise in the blood as a result. INGAP-Peptide is being tested to attempt to create new beta cells in the pancreas, and to restore the ability to produce insulin in type 1 diabetic patients.", "condition": ["Diabetes Mellitus, Insulin-Dependent"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["INGAP-Peptide", "INGAP-Peptide", "placebo"], "description": ["1.5 mL, once daily, self-administered SC injection for 90 days", "1.5 mL, once daily, self-administered SC injection for 90 days", "1.5 mL, once daily, self-administered SC injection for 90 days"], "arm_group_label": ["300 mg INGAP Peptide", "600 mg INGAP Peptide", "placebo"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria - Age 18-65 - fasting C-peptide <0.3 ng/ml. - HbA1c <10% - history of onset of type 1 DM at or before 20 years of age. - Otherwise healthy", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "65 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "Type 1 diabetes", "mesh_term": ["Diabetes Mellitus", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1"], "id": "NCT00071409"}
