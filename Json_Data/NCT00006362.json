{"brief_title": "PS-341 in Treating Patients With Advanced Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of PS-341 in treating patients who have advanced cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose and toxicity of PS-341 in patients with advanced malignancies. - Determine, in a preliminary manner, the therapeutic activity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. - Regimen A: Patients receive PS-341 IV twice weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of PS-341 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 1 of 3-4 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. - Regimen B: Once the MTD has been determined in regimen A, patients receive PS-341 IV twice weekly for 2 weeks. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed for 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 78 patients will be accrued for this study within 14 months.", "condition": "Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "bortezomib", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically proven advanced malignancy, including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), for which there is no known standard therapy that is potentially curative or definitely capable of extending life expectancy - Patients with B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders and a leukemic phase are eligible once the maximum tolerated dose is established - NHL patients must meet the following conditions: - No greater than 25% of bone marrow involved - No symptomatic brain metastases - Prior brain metastases allowed if definitively treated (radiotherapy and/or surgery) and stable for at least 8 weeks PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 and over Performance status: - ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy: - At least 12 weeks Hematopoietic: - Absolute neutrophil count at least 1,500/mm3 - Platelet count at least 100,000/mm3 Hepatic: - Bilirubin no greater than 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) - AST or ALT no greater than 2.5 times ULN (5 times ULN if liver involvement) Renal: - Creatinine no greater than 1.5 times ULN Cardiovascular: - No New York Heart Association class III or IV heart disease Other: - No uncontrolled infection - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - At least 4 weeks since prior biologic therapy or immunotherapy - No concurrent immunotherapy Chemotherapy: - At least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy (6 weeks for mitomycin or nitrosoureas) and recovered - No other concurrent chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: - Not specified Radiotherapy: - See Disease Characteristics - No prior radiotherapy to greater than 30% of bone marrow - At least 4 weeks since prior radiotherapy - No concurrent radiotherapy Surgery: - See Disease Characteristics Other: - No concurrent antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for HIV positive patients", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00006362.xml"}
