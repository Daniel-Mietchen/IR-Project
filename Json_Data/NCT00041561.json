{"brief_title": "Effects of Inhaled Nitric Oxide in the Treatment of Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure (AHRF) in Pediatrics", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of nitric oxide for inhalation on the duration of mechanical ventilation in pediatric patients with AHRF.", "detailed_description": "Patients will receive 5-ppm study gas (nitric oxide for inhalation or placebo) until Day 28 or extubation, whichever comes first. The following will be performed / recorded at specified times during the study: arterial blood gases, ventilator settings, methemoglobin, PRISM III score, and patient positioning. Selected centers will also be performing plasma cytokine assays, broncho-alveolar lavage fluid assays and a 6 month follow-up assessment.", "condition": "Anoxemia", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "inhaled nitric oxide", "description": "inhaled nitric oxide will be given at 5 ppm until day 28 or extubation", "arm_group_label": "1", "other_name": "INOmax\u00ae", "criteria": "Inclusion criteria: - Admitted to pediatric intensive care unit and have the diagnosis of acute respiratory failure - 44 weeks post conceptional age to 16 years of age - Oxygenation Index (OI) >=12 cm H2O/mmHg (as determined by two separate measurement taken 30 minutes to 4 hours apart) - Recent chest x-ray (within 24 hours) showing at least unilateral infiltrations - Mechanically ventilated <= 7 days Exclusion criteria: - Immunocompromised - Received a bone marrow transplant - Active oncological condition - Persistent right to left intracardiac shunt - Cardiovascular surgery within the last 14 days - Status asthmaticus - Decision by primary care physician not to provide full support - Received treatment with nitric oxide for inhalation or other investigational medications within 24 hours prior to study initiation, participating in surfactant trials - Chronically ventilated - Pregnant", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "16 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00041561.xml"}
