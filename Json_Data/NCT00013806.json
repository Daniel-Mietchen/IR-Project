{"brief_title": "CHP677: I-Metaiodobenzylguanidine (I-MIBG) Therapy for Refractory Neuroblastoma: a Phase II Study", "brief_summary": "131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG) is a norepinephrine analog that concentrates in adrenergic tissue and therefore holds promise for cell-specific treatment of neuroblastoma. This is a dual institution, Phase II study of 131I-MIBG administered at the previously defined maximum practical dose of 18 mCi/kg to children with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma.", "condition": ["Neuroblastoma"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["131I-MIBG"], "criteria": "Inclusion criteria: Refractory neuroblastoma with original diagnosis based on tumor histopathology or elevated urine VMA with typical tumor cells in the bone marrow.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "Relapsed and refractory neuroblastoma", "mesh_term": ["Neuroblastoma", "3-Iodobenzylguanidine"], "id": "NCT00013806"}
