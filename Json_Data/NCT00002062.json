Consideration must be given to the fact that spiramycin is a macrolide antibiotic and, therefore, may have the potential to induce hepatotoxicity. - Patients with a compromised immune system may have hepatic abnormalities or even hepatitis. If the benefit-to-risk ratio does not favor the use of spiramycin, the patients must be excluded from the study. Concurrent Medication: Excluded: - Other investigational drugs.
