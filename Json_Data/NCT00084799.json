{"brief_title": "Monoclonal Antibody Therapy in Treating Patients With Progressive Small Cell Lung Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects of monoclonal antibody therapy in treating patients with progressive small cell lung cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the targeting, tissue distribution, and pharmacokinetics of monoclonal antibody Hu3S193 in patients with progressive small cell lung cancer. Secondary - Determine the immunogenicity of this drug in these patients. - Determine tumor response in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the safety of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, pilot study. Patients receive monoclonal antibody Hu3S193 (MOAB Hu3S193) IV over 30 minutes on day 1 of weeks 1-4. Patients also receive indium In III MOAB Hu3S193 IV over 30 minutes on day 1 of weeks 1 and 4 and then undergo gamma camera imaging. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 1 and 4 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6-12 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Lung Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Biological"], "intervention_name": ["monoclonal antibody Hu3S193"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed small cell lung cancer - Progressive disease after 1-3 prior chemotherapy regimens - Measurable disease - At least 1 measurable lesion \u2265 2 cm that is not in a previously irradiated field - Positive immunohistochemical staining for Lewis Y - No uncontrolled brain or leptomeningeal metastases PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - 18 and over Performance status - Karnofsky 70-100% OR - ECOG 0-1 Life expectancy - Not specified Hematopoietic - WBC \u2265 3,500/mm^3 - Platelet count \u2265 150,000/mm^3 Hepatic - Bilirubin \u2264 2.0 mg/dL - INR \u2264 1.3 Renal - Creatinine \u2264 2.0 mg/dL Cardiovascular - No clinically significant cardiac disease - No New York Heart Association class III or IV cardiac disease Other - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception - Stool guaiac test negative - No gastrointestinal bleed within the past 6 months PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - No prior mouse monoclonal antibody Chemotherapy - See Disease Characteristics - At least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy Endocrine therapy - Not specified Radiotherapy - See Disease Characteristics - At least 4 weeks since prior radiotherapy Surgery - Not specified Other - More than 4 weeks since prior participation in any other clinical trial involving another investigational agent", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "recurrent small cell lung cancer", "mesh_term": ["Lung Neoplasms", "Small Cell Lung Carcinoma", "Antibodies", "Immunoglobulins", "Antibodies, Monoclonal"], "id": "NCT00084799"}
