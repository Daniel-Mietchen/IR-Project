Exclusion Criteria: - A serious uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would impair the ability of the subject to receive protocol therapy - Unresolved diarrhea, bowel obstruction, or history of inflammatory bowel disease - Known or documented brain metastases", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00063141.xml"}
