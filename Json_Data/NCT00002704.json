{"brief_title": "Radiation Therapy and Chemotherapy in Treating Children With CNS Relapse From Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia", "brief_summary": "Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of radiation therapy following chemotherapy in treating children with CNS relapse from acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more cancer cells.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy and toxicity of intensified systemic treatment with delayed central nervous system (CNS) irradiation in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and isolated CNS disease. II. Determine the efficacy of systemic thiotepa in reducing or clearing blasts in the cerebrospinal fluid of these patients. III. Evaluate the toxicity of single dose thiotepa followed by dexamethasone, vincristine, daunorubicin, and triple intrathecal therapy in these patients. IV. Determine the response rate of intrathecal sustained release cytarabine (DTC101) in patients with first bone marrow remission with first isolated CNS relapse. V. Assess the safety and toxicity of DTC101 in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients with significant neurologic symptoms (e.g., seizures, cranial nerve palsy, paresis, mental status changes) are entered directly on the Induction regimen and do not receive the Therapeutic Window.
