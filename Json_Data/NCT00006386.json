{"brief_title": "Radiation Therapy Followed by Carmustine in Treating Patients Who Have Supratentorial Glioblastoma Multiforme", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of radiation therapy followed by carmustine in treating patients who have supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the overall and progression-free survival in patients with supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme treated with accelerated radiotherapy and conformal stereotactic radiotherapy boost followed by carmustine. - Determine the short and long-term toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the feasibility of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive daily accelerated radiotherapy 5 days a week on weeks 1-2. On weeks 3-6, patients receive accelerated radiotherapy 4 days a week (3 days a week on week 6) and conformal stereotactic radiotherapy boost once weekly. Patients then receive carmustine IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-3 every 8 weeks for 6 courses beginning within 1 month after the completion of radiotherapy. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 76 patients will be accrued for this study within 15 months.", "condition": "Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors", "intervention_type": "Radiation", "intervention_name": "stereotactic radiosurgery", "arm_group_label": "External beam radiotherapy with stereotactic boost", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme by surgical biopsy or resection within 5 weeks of study - Postoperative residual contrast enhancing tumor and resection tumor cavity together no greater than 60 mm in maximum diameter - No well-differentiated or anaplastic astrocytomas or multifocal glioma - No tumors originating in the brainstem - No residual tumor within 10 mm of optic chiasm - No recurrent glioblastoma multiforme PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - Not specified Performance status: - Zubrod 0-1 Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - Hemoglobin greater than 9 g/dL - Absolute neutrophil count greater than 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count greater than 100,000/mm^3 Hepatic: - Bilirubin less than 2.0 mg/dL - Serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) or serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT) less than 2 times normal Renal: - Creatinine less than 1.8 mg/dL - Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) less than 30 mg/dL Pulmonary: - Chest x-ray normal OR - Diffusion capacity of lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) greater than 60% predicted Other: - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception - Neurologic functional status 0-3 - No other prior malignancy within the past 5 years except carcinoma in situ of the cervix or bladder, ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast, or nonmelanomatous skin cancer PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - Not specified Chemotherapy: - Not specified Endocrine therapy: - Concurrent steroids allowed Radiotherapy: - Not specified Surgery: - See Disease Characteristics Other: - Concurrent anticonvulsants allowed", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00006386.xml"}
