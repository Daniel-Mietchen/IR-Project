{"brief_title": "Safety and Effectiveness of Two Doses of ABT-874 as Compared to Placebo in Subjects With Multiple Sclerosis (MS)", "brief_summary": "The objective of the trial is to study the safety and effectiveness of ABT-874 administered weekly or every other week in patients with relapsing remitting and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis as compared to placebo. Effectiveness will be measured based on MRI scans done periodically throughout the study.", "detailed_description": "This study was done in subjects with relapsing remitting MS or secondary progressive MS with the objective of assessing the safety and efficacy of 200 mg of ABT-874 weekly or QOW versus placebo. There were 3 phases to the study, 24 week double blind followed by 24 weeks of an active extension, followed by 48 weeks of double blind active extension. The trial was discontinued by Abbott in Aug 2006.", "condition": ["Multiple Sclerosis"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["ABT-874/Human monoclonal antibody against IL-12", "Placebo"], "arm_group_label": ["ABT-874 200 mg weekly", "ABT 874 QOW", "Placebo"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Age between 18 and 55 years - Diagnosis of active relapse within 12 months of screening. - At least one relapse within 12 months of screening. - Must be able to walk at least 65 feet with or without assistance - Off Copaxone or interferon therapy for two months prior to screening - Able and willing to learn to self-administer weekly injections, or have a designee who will administer study medication - Female participants must use contraceptives while on study drug Exclusion Criteria: - Primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) - Immunosuppressive therapy (such as azathioprine, methotrexate (MTX), but excluding corticosteroids) within six months of randomization.
