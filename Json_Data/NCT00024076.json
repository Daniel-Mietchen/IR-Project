{"brief_title": "Radiofrequency Ablation in Treating Patients With Refractory or Advanced Lung Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Radiofrequency ablation uses high-frequency electric current to kill tumor cells. CT-guided radiofrequency ablation may be effective treatment for lung cancer. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation in treating patients who have refractory or advanced lung cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety and toxicity of radiofrequency ablation in patients with refractory or advanced pulmonary malignancies. - Determine the efficacy of this treatment, in terms of local control, in these patients. - Determine whether CT scan is a reasonable imaging assessment tool for treatment delivery and follow-up in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients undergo percutaneous CT-guided radiofrequency ablation directly to the tumor over 2 hours. Patients are followed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": "Thymoma and Thymic Carcinoma", "intervention_type": "Procedure", "intervention_name": "radiofrequency ablation", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Diagnosis of a primary or secondary intrathoracic malignancy - Any cell type or origin - Involving the intrapulmonary, mediastinal, or pleural/chest wall - Inoperable primary or metastatic cancer to the lung - Refractory to or not amenable to conventional therapy (e.g., surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy) - Single or multiple lesions that are non-contiguous with vital structures or organs such as: - Trachea - Heart - Aorta - Great vessels - Esophagus - Less than 5 cm in largest dimension - Accessible via percutaneous transthoracic route - Hepatic: - Coagulation profile normal", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00024076.xml"}
