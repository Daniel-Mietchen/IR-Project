{"brief_title": "Fluorouracil Plus Radiation Therapy Following Surgery in Treating Patients With Pancreatic Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells left after surgery. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining fluorouracil and radiation therapy in treating patients who have undergone surgery for pancreatic cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the tolerance of adjuvant fluorouracil with concurrent radiotherapy in patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma. - Determine survival without local relapse in these patients treated with this regimen. - Determine overall survival of these patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the effectiveness of this adjuvant therapy in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive high-dose radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5 weeks. Patients also receive low-dose radiotherapy 4 times a week during the last 2 weeks of the 5-week course of treatment. Patients concurrently receive fluorouracil IV continuously for 5 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": "Pancreatic Cancer", "intervention_type": "Radiation", "intervention_name": "radiation therapy", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed pancreatic adenocarcinoma - Complete macroscopic resection of tumor within past 30 days - No residual visceral or peritoneal metastasis - Involvement of Vater's ampulla or extrahepatic bile duct allowed - No vesicular or intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 to 75 Performance status: - ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - Absolute neutrophil count greater than 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count greater than 100,000/mm^3 Hepatic: - Alkaline phosphatase less than 3 times normal - Bilirubin less than 1.5 times normal Renal: - Creatinine less than 1.5 times normal Cardiovascular: - No serious cardiac failure Pulmonary: - No serious respiratory failure Other: - No other untreatable malignant tumors - No serious psychological, familial, social, or geographical conditions that would preclude study PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - Not specified Chemotherapy: - No prior chemotherapy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma Endocrine therapy: - Not specified Radiotherapy: - No prior radiotherapy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma - No prior radiotherapy in an anatomically proximal region to treatment area Surgery: - See Disease Characteristics", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "75 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00010062.xml"}
