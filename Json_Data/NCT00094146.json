{"brief_title": "Sandostatin LAR\u00ae Depot in Patients With Primary Insulin Hypersecretion (PIH) and at Least Moderate Obesity", "brief_summary": "This study is in patients with at least moderate obesity (Body Mass Index [BMI] > 30 kg/m2 or approximately 30 or more pounds overweight) and who also produce too much insulin (insulin stores sugar as fat). Sandostatin LAR\u00ae Depot suppresses insulin, and is being developed to help with weight loss in people who find it hard to lose weight on their own because they produce too much insulin. The main purpose of the study is to find the lowest dose of Sandostatin LAR\u00ae Depot that safely helps overweight people lose weight. The study will also compare weight loss in obese patients who receive one of three different dosages of Sandostatin LAR Depot or placebo.", "condition": ["Primary Insulin Hypersecretion", "Obesity"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Sandostatin LAR Depot"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: You may qualify for this study if you: - are between the ages of 18-70 (male or female) - are at least moderately obese (BMI > 30 kg/m2 or approximately 30 or more pounds overweight) - and pass an oral glucose tolerance test (a 3 hour test to determine if your body produces too much insulin) Exclusion Criteria: You are not qualified for this study if you: - have diabetes - have been able to lose weight with diet and exercise alone - have previously received Sandostatin LAR\u00ae Depot", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "70 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "Obesity", "mesh_term": ["Obesity", "Octreotide"], "id": "NCT00094146"}
