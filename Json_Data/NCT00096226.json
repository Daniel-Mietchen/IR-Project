{"brief_title": "Paclitaxel, Carboplatin, and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients Who Are Undergoing Surgery for Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Giving paclitaxel and carboplatin together with radiation therapy before surgery may shrink the tumor so that it can be removed. Giving chemotherapy after surgery may kill any tumor cells remaining after surgery. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving paclitaxel and carboplatin together with radiation therapy works in treating patients who are undergoing surgery for stage III non-small cell lung cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the mediastinal node clearance rate in patients with stage IIIA or IIIB non-small cell lung cancer treated with neoadjuvant induction chemoradiotherapy comprising paclitaxel, carboplatin, and high-dose radiotherapy followed by surgical resection for patients found to be resectable and consolidative chemotherapy comprising paclitaxel and carboplatin. - Determine the rate of complete pathological response in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the feasibility of surgical resection after neoadjuvant induction chemoradiotherapy in these patients. - Determine disease-free and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. - Induction chemoradiotherapy: Patients undergo high-dose radiotherapy (including a total of 6 fractions of boost radiotherapy after large field radiotherapy) once daily, 5 days a week, for approximately 7 weeks. Beginning on the first day of radiotherapy, patients also receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes once weekly for 6 weeks. Patients are reassessed 4 weeks after the completion of induction chemoradiotherapy. Patients with resectable tumors undergo surgery within 2 weeks of reassessment and then receive consolidation chemotherapy no later than 10 weeks after surgery. Patients with unresectable tumors proceed directly to consolidation chemotherapy. - Consolidation chemotherapy: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 1 hour every 21 days for 2 courses. Patients are followed at 6 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2-3 years, and then annually for 4-5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-60 patients will be accrued for this study within 20 months.", "condition": "Lung Cancer", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Consolidation Paclitaxel", "arm_group_label": "Chemoradiation, Surgery, Chemotherapy", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically or cytologically confirmed non-small cell lung cancer - Stage IIIA (T1-3, N2) or IIIB (N3) - No clinical or radiographic evidence of supraclavicular lymph node involvement - Pancoast tumors eligible - Mediastinal nodal disease by mediastinoscopy, thoracoscopy, Chamberlain procedure, or transbronchial needle aspirate - Nodes found positive by mediastinoscopy are defined as N2 disease - Primary tumor must be accessible for high-dose radiotherapy - Measurable disease - Potential candidate for surgery - No small cell lung cancer - No bronchoalveolar carcinoma with lobar or multilobar involvement - No malignant pleural effusion - No distant metastases PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - 18 and over Performance status - Zubrod 0-1 Life expectancy - At least 6 months Hematopoietic - White blood cell count (WBC) \u2265 3,000/mm^3 - Absolute granulocyte count \u2265 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count \u2265 100,000/mm^3 Hepatic - Bilirubin \u2264 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) - Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \u2264 2.5 times ULN - Albumin \u2265 3.0 g/dL Renal - Creatinine \u2264 1.5 times ULN Cardiovascular - No clinically evident superior vena cava syndrome Pulmonary - Projected post-operative forced expiratory volume(FEV)_1 > 800 mL Other - No known hypersensitivity to Cremophor EL - No unintentional weight loss \u2265 5% within the past 6 months - No active serious infection - No other serious medical condition that would preclude study participation - No dementia or significantly altered mental status that would preclude giving informed consent - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - Not specified Chemotherapy - No prior systemic chemotherapy - No other concurrent chemotherapy Endocrine therapy - Concurrent steroids allowed as antiemetics or for prevention and amelioration of hypersensitivity reactions - No concurrent hormonal therapy (except megestrol for appetite stimulation, estrogen, or birth control pills) Radiotherapy - No prior radiotherapy to the thorax - No concurrent intensity-modulated radiotherapy - No concurrent post-operative thoracic radiotherapy Surgery - Not specified Other - No other concurrent investigational therapy - No concurrent amifostine", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00096226.xml"}
