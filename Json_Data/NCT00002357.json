{"brief_title": "The Safety and Effectiveness of HBY 097 Used With or Without AZT in HIV-Infected Patients Who Have Mild or No Symptoms", "brief_summary": "To obtain preliminary information on the safety, tolerability, and antiretroviral activity of HBY 097 alone or in combination with zidovudine ( AZT ) versus AZT alone. PER 1/19/96 AMENDMENT: AZT monotherapy arm was eliminated.", "detailed_description": "Patients are randomized to receive one of three doses of HBY 097 with or without AZT or AZT alone for 12 weeks (AZT monotherapy arm eliminated per 1/19/96 amendment). All patients at a given dose level of HBY 097 must be enrolled and adequate safety data obtained before escalation in subsequent patients begins. Additional patients are entered at the optimal dose of HBY 097. Patients are evaluated weekly for the first 4 weeks and then every 2 weeks for the next 9 weeks. PER AMENDMENT: Enrollment to the lowest dose cohort is completed.", "condition": ["HIV Infections"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["HBY 097", "Zidovudine"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria Concurrent Medication: Allowed: - Treatment for opportunistic infection that develops on study.
