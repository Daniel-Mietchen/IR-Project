Arm 2 (40 patients): DLV plus IDV plus 3TC*. Arm 3 (40 patients): DLV plus ZDV plus IDV plus 3TC. Arm 4 (40 patients): ZDV plus IDV plus 3TC. - Dose determined by body weight. Patients may opt to continue on study for 24 additional weeks at the discretion of the investigator.", "condition": "HIV Infections", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Zidovudine", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria Prior Medication: Allowed: Less than 1 month prior treatment with zidovudine.
