This study is considered to be \"investigational\" because previous studies with Neulasta\u00ae used next day dosing and not same day dosing.", "condition": ["Lung Cancer", "Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Other"], "intervention_name": ["PI Discretion"], "description": ["PI Discretion"], "arm_group_label": ["PLACEBO", "Pegfilgrastim"], "study_pop": "\n      ", "sampling_method": "Non-Probability Sample", "criteria": "Eligibility Criteria: - Age 18 years or older - Diagnosis of advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) - Have not received any prior chemotherapy - Have not received radiation therapy or undergone major surgery within the past 2 weeks", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "pegfilgrastim", "mesh_term": ["Lung Neoplasms", "Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung", "Docetaxel", "Carboplatin"], "id": "NCT00094822"}
