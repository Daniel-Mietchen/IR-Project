{"brief_title": "Tocladesine in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Progressive Metastatic Colorectal Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of tocladesine in treating patients who have recurrent or progressive metastatic colorectal cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of tocladesine in patients with recurrent or progressive metastatic colorectal cancer. - Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity of this drug in these patients. - Assess any therapeutic activity in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive tocladesine IV continuously on days 1-5 and 8-12. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 10 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tocladesine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, up to 14 additional patients are treated at this dose level. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-38 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Colorectal Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["tocladesine"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum - Recurrent or progressive after failing prior fluorouracil and irinotecan chemotherapy, sequentially or in combination, unless unable to tolerate irinotecan - Measurable disease PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 to 75 Performance status: - ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - Granulocyte count at least 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 100,000/mm^3 - Hemoglobin at least 10 g/dL Hepatic: - Bilirubin no greater than 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) - AST and ALT no greater than 5 times ULN - PT/aPTT no greater than 1.2 times ULN Renal: - Creatinine no greater than 1.5 mg/dL - Creatinine clearance at least 50 mL/min - No impaired renal function Cardiovascular: - No impaired cardiac function Other: - No active infection - No other malignancy within the past 5 years except basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - Not specified Chemotherapy: - See Disease Characteristics - At least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: - Not specified Radiotherapy: - At least 4 weeks since prior radiotherapy Surgery: - Not specified Other: - No other concurrent anticancer drugs - No concurrent chronic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents - No concurrent chronic therapeutic anticoagulation", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "75 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "recurrent rectal cancer", "mesh_term": ["Colorectal Neoplasms", "8-chloro-cyclic adenosine monophosphate"], "id": "NCT00021268"}
