{"brief_title": "Radiolabeled Monoclonal Antibody in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of radiolabeled monoclonal antibody in treating patients who have relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan when administered in combination with rituximab in patients with relapsed or refractory low-grade, follicular, or transformed CD20-positive B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). - Determine the toxicity of different doses of yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the frequency of reversal of bone marrow involvement with NHL in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the antitumor response in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan. Patients receive rituximab IV once weekly on weeks 1-4. After 4 doses of rituximab, patients without bone marrow involvement and cellularity greater than 50% expected receive rituximab IV once weekly on weeks 6 and 7 and yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan IV over 10 minutes with the final dose of rituximab (day 43). Cohorts of 5-6 patients receive escalating dose of yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 4 of 5 or 3 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 6 and 12 weeks, every 2-3 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months for 2 years.
