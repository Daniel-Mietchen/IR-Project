{"brief_title": "Etoposide Plus Radiation Therapy Followed by Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Children With Newly Diagnosed Advanced Medulloblastoma", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of etoposide plus radiation therapy followed by combination chemotherapy in treating children with newly diagnosed advanced medulloblastoma.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Assess the response rate and toxicity of oral etoposide and radiotherapy in children with newly diagnosed high stage medulloblastoma. - Compare the response rate and toxicity of these patients to historical control patients registered on POG #9031. - Estimate the 2-year event-free survival and overall survival of these patients. - Evaluate the toxicity of dose intensive chemotherapy with oral etoposide, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, and vincristine following craniospinal irradiation in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients begin treatment within 1 month of surgery. Patients receive 6 weeks of radiotherapy to the head and spine, with boosts to the posterior fossa and to sites of metastasis. Patients also receive 2 courses of oral etoposide once daily for 3 weeks concurrent with and immediately following radiotherapy (weeks 1-3 and 5-7). Patients then receive adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin IV once every 4 weeks for 3 courses beginning on week 11, oral etoposide daily for 21 days every 4 weeks for 3 courses (weeks 11, 15, and 19), cyclophosphamide IV on days 1 and 2 with filgrastim (G-CSF) SQ daily for at least 10 days every 4 weeks for 8 courses (weeks 23-51), and vincristine IV on days 1, 8, and 15 every 4 weeks for 8 courses (weeks 23-51). Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 48 patients will be accrued for this study within about 2 years.", "condition": ["Brain Tumors", "Central Nervous System Tumors"], "intervention_type": ["Biological", "Drug", "Drug", "Drug", "Drug", "Radiation"], "intervention_name": ["filgrastim", "cisplatin", "cyclophosphamide", "etoposide", "vincristine sulfate", "radiation therapy"], "arm_group_label": ["Treatment 1, Etoposide, 50mg/m2/day", "Treatment 2, Etoposide, 35mg/m2/day", "Treatment 1, Etoposide, 50mg/m2/day", "Treatment 2, Etoposide, 35mg/m2/day", "Treatment 1, Etoposide, 50mg/m2/day", "Treatment 2, Etoposide, 35mg/m2/day", "Treatment 1, Etoposide, 50mg/m2/day", "Treatment 2, Etoposide, 35mg/m2/day", "Treatment 1, Etoposide, 50mg/m2/day", "Treatment 2, Etoposide, 35mg/m2/day", "Treatment 1, Etoposide, 50mg/m2/day", "Treatment 2, Etoposide, 35mg/m2/day"], "other_name": ["Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor", "r-metHuG-CSF", "G-CSF", "Neupogen\u00ae", "NSC #614629", "Cis-diamminedichloroplatinum II", "CDDP", "Platinol", "NSC #119875", "CTX", "Cytoxan", "NSC #026271", "IND #7089", "VP-16", "VePesid", "NSC #141540", "IND #9197", "VCR", "Oncovin", "NSC #067574", "IND #7161"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically diagnosed advanced (high grade) childhood medulloblastoma - Residual disease of at least 1.5 cm2 in size on MRI or CT scan OR - Evidence of CNS or extraneural metastases PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 3 to 21 Performance status: - Not specified Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - Absolute neutrophil count at least 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 100,000/mm^3 Hepatic: - SGPT less than 5 times normal - Bilirubin less than 1.5 mg/dL Renal: - Creatinine less than 1.7 mg/dL OR - Creatinine clearance greater than 70 mL/min Other: - Not pregnant or nursing - Fertile patients must use effective contraception PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - Not specified Chemotherapy: - No prior chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: - Prior corticosteroids allowed Radiotherapy: - No prior radiotherapy Surgery: - Not specified", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "3 Years", "maximum_age": "21 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "untreated childhood medulloblastoma", "mesh_term": ["Medulloblastoma", "Nervous System Neoplasms", "Central Nervous System Neoplasms", "Etoposide phosphate", "Cisplatin", "Cyclophosphamide", "Etoposide", "Vincristine", "Lenograstim"], "id": "NCT00003573"}
