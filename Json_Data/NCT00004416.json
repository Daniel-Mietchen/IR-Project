{"brief_title": "Randomized Study of Botulinum Toxin Type A for Achalasia", "brief_summary": "OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the efficacy of two doses of botulinum toxin in the treatment of achalasia. II. Compare the safety of these two doses in these patients.", "detailed_description": "PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, dose response study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms; each arm receives a different dose of botulinum toxin type A. All patients undergo a flexible upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Botulinum toxin is injected into the lower esophageal sphincter into each of 4 quadrants. Some patients may receive a second treatment, depending on response and/or time of relapse. Patients are followed daily for 7 days, then every 1-6 months for 1-2 years after treatment.
