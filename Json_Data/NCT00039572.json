{"brief_title": "Boron Neutron Capture Therapy in Treating Patients With Glioblastoma Multiforme or Melanoma Metastatic to the Brain", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Radiation therapy such as boron neutron capture therapy may kill tumor cells without harming normal tissue. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of boron neutron capture therapy in treating patients who have glioblastoma multiforme or melanoma metastatic to the brain.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the time course, uniformity, and severity of acute and chronic normal tissue reactions in patients with glioblastoma multiforme or intracranial melanoma treated with boronophenylalanine-fructose complex (BPA-f) followed by cranial neutron irradiation using a new fission converter beam facility. - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of cranial neutron capture therapy in these patients. - Determine, through serial objective measurements, the clinical response in patients treated with this therapy. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of BPA-f in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of cranial neutron capture therapy (NCT). Patients receive boronophenylalanine-fructose complex IV over 90 minutes followed by cranial NCT on days 1 and 2. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of NCT until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, additional patients are treated at the MTD. Patients are followed at 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months and then every 6 months for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.", "condition": ["Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors", "Melanoma (Skin)", "Metastatic Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["boronophenylalanine-fructose complex"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed glioblastoma multiforme OR - Radiographically diagnosed brain metastases after a diagnosis of melanoma - Contrast-enhanced tumor volume must not exceed 60 mL PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 and over Performance status: - ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy: - At least 6 months Hematopoietic: - Not specified Hepatic: - Not specified Renal: - Creatinine normal Cardiovascular: - No prior severe cardiac disease, including the following: - Uncontrolled arrhythmias or conduction defects - Unstable or newly diagnosed angina pectoris - Recent coronary artery disease - Congestive heart failure Other: - Not pregnant - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception during and for at least 6 months after study - No prior phenylketonuria - No cognitive impairment that would preclude informed consent PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - Not specified Chemotherapy: - No concurrent chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: - Not specified Radiotherapy: - No prior cranial irradiation Surgery: - Not specified", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "adult gliosarcoma", "mesh_term": ["Melanoma", "Glioblastoma", "Neoplasm Metastasis", "Nervous System Neoplasms", "Central Nervous System Neoplasms"], "id": "NCT00039572"}
