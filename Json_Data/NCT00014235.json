{"brief_title": "Fludarabine Phosphate and Total-Body Radiation Followed by Donor Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplant and Immunosuppression in Treating Patients With Hematologic Malignancies", "brief_summary": "This clinical trial studies fludarabine phosphate and total-body radiation followed by donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant and immunosuppression in treating patients with hematologic malignancies. Giving chemotherapy and total-body irradiation before a donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving total-body irradiation together with fludarabine phosphate, cyclosporine, and mycophenolate mofetil before transplant may stop this from happening.", "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the rate of grade III/IV graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in patients treated with low-dose total body irradiation (TBI), fludarabine (fludarabine phosphate), PBSC infusion and immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil and a disease risk-based cyclosporine taper. II. To estimate the risk of graft rejection, GVHD, disease response, non-relapse mortality and the incidence and severity of infectious complications using this treatment strategy. OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups. ARM I (indolent disease): CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) on days -4 to -2 and undergo TBI on day 0. TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo donor peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) on day 0. IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive cyclosporine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) or IV every 8-12 hours on days -3 to 56 with a taper to day 180 and mycophenolate mofetil PO BID or IV every 8-12 hours on days 0 to 27. ARM II (aggressive disease): CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate and undergo TBI as in Arm I. TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo donor PBSCT on day 0. IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive cyclosporine PO BID or IV every 8-12 hours on days -3 to 56 with a taper to day 70 and mycophenolate mofetil as in Arm I. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.", "condition": ["Acute Myeloid Leukemia/Transient Myeloproliferative Disorder", "Acute Undifferentiated Leukemia", "Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Remission", "Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Remission", "Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia With 11q23 (MLL) Abnormalities", "Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia With Del(5q)", "Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia With Inv(16)(p13;q22)", "Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia With t(15;17)(q22;q12)", "Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia With t(16;16)(p13;q22)", "Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia With t(8;21)(q22;q22)", "Adult Nasal Type Extranodal NK/T-cell Lymphoma", "Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma", "Angioimmunoblastic T-cell Lymphoma", "Blastic Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell Neoplasm", "Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Remission", "Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Remission", "Childhood Burkitt Lymphoma", "Childhood Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma", "Childhood Immunoblastic Large Cell Lymphoma", "Childhood Myelodysplastic Syndromes", "Childhood Nasal Type Extranodal NK/T-cell Lymphoma", "Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia", "Cutaneous B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma", "de Novo Myelodysplastic Syndromes", "Extranodal Marginal Zone B-cell Lymphoma of Mucosa-associated Lymphoid Tissue", "Hepatosplenic T-cell Lymphoma", "Intraocular Lymphoma", "Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia", "Mast Cell Leukemia", "Myelodysplastic/Myeloproliferative Neoplasm, Unclassifiable", "Nodal Marginal Zone B-cell Lymphoma", "Noncutaneous Extranodal Lymphoma", "Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma", "Post-transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder", "Previously Treated Myelodysplastic Syndromes", "Primary Systemic Amyloidosis", "Recurrent Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia", "Recurrent Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia", "Recurrent Adult Burkitt Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Diffuse Mixed Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Diffuse Small Cleaved Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Grade III Lymphomatoid Granulomatosis", "Recurrent Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Immunoblastic Large Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Lymphoblastic Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma", "Recurrent Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia", "Recurrent Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia", "Recurrent Childhood Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Childhood Grade III Lymphomatoid Granulomatosis", "Recurrent Childhood Large Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Childhood Lymphoblastic Lymphoma", "Recurrent Childhood Small Noncleaved Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Cutaneous T-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Recurrent Grade 1 Follicular Lymphoma", "Recurrent Grade 2 Follicular Lymphoma", "Recurrent Grade 3 Follicular Lymphoma", "Recurrent Mantle Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Marginal Zone Lymphoma", "Recurrent Mycosis Fungoides/Sezary Syndrome", "Recurrent Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma", "Recurrent/Refractory Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia", "Refractory Hairy Cell Leukemia", "Refractory Multiple Myeloma", "Small Intestine Lymphoma", "Splenic Marginal Zone Lymphoma", "Stage II Multiple Myeloma", "Stage III Multiple Myeloma", "T-cell Large Granular Lymphocyte Leukemia", "Testicular Lymphoma", "Untreated Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia", "Untreated Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia", "Untreated Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia", "Untreated Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Other Myeloid Malignancies", "Waldenstr\u00f6m Macroglobulinemia"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Radiation", "Procedure", "Procedure", "Drug", "Drug", "Other"], "intervention_name": ["fludarabine phosphate", "total-body irradiation", "peripheral blood stem cell transplantation", "allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation", "cyclosporine", "mycophenolate mofetil", "laboratory biomarker analysis"], "description": ["Given IV", "Undergo TBI", "Undergo PBSCT", "Undergo PBSCT", "Given PO or IV", "Given IV or PO", "Correlative studies"], "arm_group_label": ["Arm I (indolent disease)", "Arm II (aggressive disease)", "Arm I (indolent disease)", "Arm II (aggressive disease)", "Arm I (indolent disease)", "Arm II (aggressive disease)", "Arm I (indolent disease)", "Arm II (aggressive disease)", "Arm I (indolent disease)", "Arm II (aggressive disease)", "Arm I (indolent disease)", "Arm II (aggressive disease)", "Arm I (indolent disease)", "Arm II (aggressive disease)"], "other_name": ["2-F-ara-AMP", "Beneflur", "Fludara", "TBI", "PBPC transplantation", "PBSC transplantation", "peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation", "transplantation, peripheral blood stem cell", "ciclosporin", "cyclosporin", "cyclosporin A", "CYSP", "Sandimmune", "Cellcept", "MMF"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or multiple myeloma who are not eligible for a curative autologous transplantation or who have received a prior autologous transplantation;
