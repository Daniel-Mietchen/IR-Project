{"brief_title": "Morbidity After Diagnosis and Treatment of Breast Cancer Patients", "brief_summary": "This study will examine the frequency and severity of problems in women with breast cancer for 2 years following initial medical treatment, including: - Physical impairments, such as loss of strength or flexibility, increased weight and swelling. - Symptom distress, such as pain, fatigue and weakness. - Functional limitations and disabilities, such as loss of independence in activities of daily living (e.g., grooming, bathing, dressing, driving a car), work and social and recreational activities. It will identify factors associated with these problems and try to determine their relationship to them. Patients 18 years of age and older with stage I, II, III or IV breast cancer may be eligible for this study. Women who have a breast biopsy negative for cancer will also be enrolled as control subjects. Participants will be drawn from patients referred to the National Naval Medical Center for diagnosis and treatment during 2001-2003. Participants will be evaluated over a 2-year period during an initial baseline visit (before medical treatment or biopsy) and follow-up visits at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months following procedures: - Interview about past medical history and present illness, social and recreational activities, functional independence at work and during activities of daily living. - Completion of questionnaires including health survey, upper limb disability questionnaire, and physical activity questionnaire. (Questionnaires are completed only at baseline and 12 and 24 months after medical treatment begins.) The questionnaires take about 30 to 40 minutes to complete. - Upper body examination, including pain measurement using a 10-point scale, active and passive range of motion measures, manual muscle testing measures using a 10-point scale, timed upper limb lift test, and measures of upper limb volume and girth.", "detailed_description": "Patients and healthy participants will undergo an interview at the beginning of the study and 1,3,6,9, 12, 18 and 24 months and answer questions about their medical history; family history; current problem and treatment; pain history; and social, physical and recreational activities.

Healthy female individuals will be controls. Subjects must be over 18 years of age and post-puberty as breast cancer does not occur prior to puberty; and been seen pre-surgical or medical intervention for baseline measurements and agree to participate in six follow-up visits of 30-45 minutes in duration during the next two-years.
