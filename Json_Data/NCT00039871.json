{"brief_title": "PEG-Intron Plus Rebetol Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C Subjects Who Failed Response to Alpha-Interferon Plus Ribavirin (Study P02370)", "brief_summary": "The objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of PEG-Intron 1.5 ug/kg/wk plus REBETOL (ribavirin) 800-1400 mg/day in adults with chronic hepatitis C with moderate to severe liver fibrosis or cirrhosis who failed to respond to previous treatment with an alpha interferon in combination with ribavirin. Patients who do not respond to PEG-Intron plus REBETOL (ribavirin) will be enrolled in a long-term maintenance study to evaluate the effectiveness of PEG-Intron monotherapy versus no treatment for the prevention of disease progression (Protocols P02569 and P02570).", "condition": ["Hepatitis", "Hepatitis C, Chronic", "Fibrosis", "Liver Cirrhosis"], "intervention_type": ["Biological", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["PegIntron (peginterferon alfa-2b; SCH 54031)", "REBETOL (ribavirin; SCH 18908)"], "description": ["PegIntron (peginterferon alfa-2b) administered at a dose of 1.5 mcg/kg subcutaneously (SC) once a week (QW) for up to 48 weeks", "REBETOL (ribavirin) administered on a weight basis: 800-1400 mg/day orally (PO) for up to 48 weeks"], "arm_group_label": ["Overall study population", "Overall study population"], "other_name": ["SCH 54031"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Age at entry 18-65 - Positive for Hepatitis C - Nonresponder to previous treatment (minimum of 3 months) with an alpha Interferon plus ribavirin - Liver biopsy demonstrating moderate to severe fibrosis or cirrhosis Exclusion Criteria: - Any cause for the liver disease other than chronic hepatitis C - History or presence of complications of cirrhosis - Alcohol or illicit drug use or methadone treatment within the past 2 years - Treatment for chronic hepatitis C within the previous 6 months - Diseases or conditions that could interfere with the subject's participation in and completion of the study", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "65 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "mesh_term": ["Hepatitis", "Hepatitis A", "Hepatitis C", "Hepatitis, Chronic", "Hepatitis C, Chronic", "Liver Cirrhosis", "Interferons", "Ribavirin", "Peginterferon alfa-2b", "Interferon-alpha"], "id": "NCT00039871"}
