{"brief_title": "Natalizumab in the Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis in Subjects Receiving Methotrexate", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability and efficacy of natalizumab in subjects diagnosed with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) receiving concomitant treatment with methotrexate (MTX). It is thought that natalizumab may stop the movement of certain white blood cells, known as lymphocytes, into joint tissue. These cells are thought to cause damage in the joints leading to the symptoms of RA.", "condition": "Rheumatoid Arthritis", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "placebo", "arm_group_label": "placebo", "other_name": "TYSABRI", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: Subjects will be eligible to begin study participation if they meet all of the following inclusion criteria: - Subject is able to read, understand, and voluntarily sign the approved Informed Consent form prior to the performance of any study-specific procedures; - Male or female subjects, \u226518 to \u226475 years of age, who has a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis Functional Class 1 to 3 by the 1987 Revised American Rheumatism Association Criteria for the Classification of Rheumatoid Arthritis for at least 6 months prior to screening; - Subject is on a stable dose of MTX of at least 10 mg/week for \u22653 months prior to randomization (Month 0) without an adequate response; - Female subjects of childbearing potential agree to use adequate, contraceptive methods (either intrauterine device [IUD], oral or depot contraceptive, or barrier plus spermicide).
