{"brief_title": "Effects of Exercise on Markers of Inflammation in Skeletal Muscle in Elderly Hip Fracture Patients", "brief_summary": "Decreased skeletal muscle mass is a prevalent condition among the elderly, and an important cause of disability and functional decline. The declines in muscle mass associated with aging may be related to alterations in specific kinds of growth factors in the muscle. Elderly hip fracture patients often have significant decreases in muscle mass. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether an exercise program can induce changes in muscle growth factors that are associated with increases in muscle mass and strength in elderly hip fracture patients.", "condition": ["Hip Fractures", "Muscular Atrophy"], "intervention_type": ["Behavioral"], "intervention_name": ["Exercise"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Enrollment in HSC protocol #97-0695 \"Rehabilitation Intensification Post Hip Fracture\" - Community-dwelling - Hip fracture within 16 weeks of the screening assessment for protocol 97-0695 - Persistent mobility and/or ADL impairments, but independent in ambulation - Modified Physical Performance Test (PPT) score between 12 and 28", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "65 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "sarcopenia", "mesh_term": ["Fractures, Bone", "Atrophy", "Hip Fractures", "Muscular Atrophy"], "id": "NCT00006194"}
