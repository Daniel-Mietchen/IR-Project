{"brief_title": "Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Advanced Kidney Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of fenretinide in treating patients who have advanced kidney cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma treated with fenretinide. - Determine progression-free and overall survival of this patient population treated with this drug. - Determine the quantitative and qualitative toxic effects of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral fenretinide twice a day for 7 days. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 9-21 months.", "condition": ["Kidney Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["fenretinide"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced unresectable, locally recurrent, or metastatic renal cell carcinoma - Measurable disease - At least 20 mm with conventional techniques OR - At least 10 mm with spiral CT scan - No nonmeasurable disease only including: - Bone lesions - Leptomeningeal disease - Ascites - Pleural/pericardial effusion - Lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis - Abdominal masses not confirmed and followed by imaging techniques - Cystic lesions - No known brain metastases - History of brain metastases that have been resected and/or irradiated with subsequent normal brain CT scan allowed PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 and over Performance status: - ECOG 0-2 OR - Karnofsky 60-100% Life expectancy: - More than 12 weeks Hematopoietic: - Absolute neutrophil count at least 1,500/mm3 - Platelet count at least 100,000/mm3 Hepatic: - Bilirubin no greater than 1.5 mg/dL - AST no greater than 2.5 times upper limit of normal Renal: - Creatinine no greater than 2 mg/dL OR - Creatinine clearance at least 60 mL/min Cardiovascular: - No symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or cardiac arrhythmia Other: - Not pregnant or nursing - Fertile patients must use effective contraception - No other prior malignancy within the past 2 years except nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of any site - No history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to fenretinide - No other concurrent uncontrolled illness (e.g., ongoing or active infection) - No concurrent psychiatric illness or social situation that would preclude study - History of HIV allowed if no active infection or history of retinitis - No history of retinal disease, night blindness, or difficulty seeing in the dark PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - Prior biologic therapy allowed Chemotherapy: - No more than 1 prior chemotherapy regimen Endocrine therapy: - Not specified Radiotherapy: - See Disease Characteristics - At least 4 weeks since prior radiotherapy Surgery: - See Disease Characteristics Other: - Recovered from prior therapy - No prior systemic retinoid therapy - No concurrent antioxidants (e.g., ascorbic acid or vitamin E) - No other concurrent therapy for renal cell carcinoma", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "recurrent renal cell cancer", "mesh_term": ["Carcinoma, Renal Cell", "Kidney Neoplasms"], "id": "NCT00011973"}
