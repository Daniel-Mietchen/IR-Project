{"brief_title": "Prolonged Exposure Therapy for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Following Sexual Assault", "brief_summary": "This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a brief cognitive behavioral therapy, administered by community agencies, for the treatment of patients with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).", "detailed_description": "PE is a brief cognitive behavioral therapy that can ameliorate symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety in survivors of various types of trauma. PE has been successfully implemented by counselors at a community rape crisis clinic (Women Organized Against Rape [WOAR]) who received extensive training and weekly supervision from PE experts. Such extensive expert involvement is not a practical model for long-term clinical practice in a community-based clinic. Therefore, Part 1 of this study will examine whether counselors at WOAR can maintain their PE implementation success with reduced expert involvement. In Part 2 of this study, PE will be implemented by counselors at another community clinic (Joseph J. Peters Institute [JJPI]) to examine its effectiveness in treating PTSD and to determine the generalizability of training procedures. Participants in this study are randomly assigned to either PE or to individual and group therapy. Treatment sessions are conducted weekly for 10 to 20 weeks, based on participants' rates of improvement. Participants are assessed before treatment, after 10 weeks, and again in the follow-up phase at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months post-treatment.", "condition": "Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic", "intervention_type": "Behavioral", "intervention_name": "Supportive counseling (SC)", "description": "Supportive counseling is an individual therapy delivered in 10 weekly, 90 minute sessions.
