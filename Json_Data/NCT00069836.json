{"brief_title": "Study Of AVANDAMET\u00ae With Or Without Insulin In Type II Diabetes Mellitus Patients. AVANDAMET\u00ae is a Registered Trademark of the GSK Group of Companies.", "brief_summary": "This study was designed to test the safety and efficacy (how well it works) of AVANDAMET in combination with insulin in improving the control of blood sugar when compared with taking insulin on its own. AVANDAMET capsules contain a fixed dose of AVANDIA and metformin. Both AVANDIA and metformin are medicines which are individually licensed for the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus. Because they act in different ways, it is thought that combining them may give an increased benefit of treating diabetes and reducing blood sugar.", "condition": "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Rosiglitazone/metformin", "arm_group_label": "Arm 1", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Patients must have been diagnosed with type II diabetes mellitus and not have adequate glycaemic controlled while receiving at least 1.5g of metformin. - Patients must have a body mass index of greater than 25 kg/m2 and must not suffer from ankle swelling.
