{"brief_title": "Phase II Study of Ribose, Uridine, and Thymidine for a Complex Syndrome Involving Excessive 5'-Nucleotidase Activity", "brief_summary": "OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy of oral ribose in patients with a complex 5'-nucleotidase syndrome who have not received uridine (UR) and thymidine (TDR). II. Evaluate the efficacy of UR/oral ribose and UR/TDR. III. Evaluate the efficacy of oral ribose given in combination with UR/TDR.", "detailed_description": "PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Newly identified patients receive ribose daily for 8 weeks. Patients who improve continue therapy. If improvement then reaches a plateau, uridine (UR) and thymidine (TDR) are added to the regimen. Patients who receive no benefit after 8 weeks of ribose are treated with UR/TDR. Patients who improve after 8 weeks of this combination continue therapy. Ribose is added to the treatment regimen for patients on UR/TDR at entry. At maximal improvement, TDR and UR are sequentially tapered.", "condition": ["5'-Nucleotidase Syndrome"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["ribose", "thymidine", "uridine"], "criteria": "PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA: --Disease Characteristics-- Complex syndrome with excessive skin fibroblast 5'-nucleotidase activity characterized by: Recurrent infection Seizure disorder Speech impairment Attention deficit and behavior problems --Prior/Concurrent Therapy-- Concurrent uridine and thymidine therapy allowed --Patient Characteristics-- Other: No pregnant women", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "21 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "rare disease", "mesh_term": ["Syndrome", "Metabolism, Inborn Errors"], "id": "NCT00004658"}
