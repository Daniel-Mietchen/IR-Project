{"brief_title": "Immunomodulation of HIV-1 Infected Individuals With PEG-Interleukin-2", "brief_summary": "To evaluate the safety and immunological effects of polyethylene glycolated-interleukin-2 (PEG-IL-2) on asymptomatic (without symptoms) HIV-seropositive patients who are taking zidovudine (AZT). To enhance measures of immune function with well-tolerated doses of PEG-IL-2, an immunomodulator, in a regimen designed to allow its use in outpatients with normal daily activity (i.e., full-time employment, etc.). Recombinant IL-2 (without PEG modification) was administered to HIV-infected patients by daily intradermal injection. At the low doses used, this was non-toxic, well-tolerated, and gave a systemic response as measured by natural killer cell and lymphokine-activated killer cell activity, but required daily administration. In the current study, the PEG modification of IL-2 is used since it has a much longer prolonged half-life compared with the non-PEG compound, without loss of functional activity.", "detailed_description": "Recombinant IL-2 (without PEG modification) was administered to HIV-infected patients by daily intradermal injection.

In the current study, the PEG modification of IL-2 is used since it has a much longer prolonged half-life compared with the non-PEG compound, without loss of functional activity. In the first, dose-escalation phase of the study, PEG-IL-2 is injected into the skin of the back by either the intradermal (ID) or subcutaneous (SC) route, to establish an optimal dose (which when given ID results in local induration = or > 25 mm without significant toxicity). The ID and SC routes are compared for systemic effect and toxicity. In the second phase of the study, the PEG-IL-2 is administered for 6-8 weeks using the optimal dosage, frequency, and route determined in the initial phase (probably 2-3 times per week) while local and systemic effects are monitored. These include measures of viral titer, peripheral blood mononuclear cell phenotype, CBC and CD4 counts, and in vitro cytotoxicity assays.", "condition": "HIV Infections", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Interleukin-2, Polyethylene Glycolated", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria Concurrent Medication: Allowed: - Zidovudine (AZT). - Necessary topical agents such as nystatin, clotrimazole, and acyclovir. - Aerosolized pentamidine for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis. - Oral antibiotics for PCP prophylaxis if hematologically stable for = or > 30 days prior to study entry. - Necessary systemic agents for the treatment of other chronic disorders, such as diabetes or asthma.
