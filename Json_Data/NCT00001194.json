{"brief_title": "NMR Scanning on Patients", "brief_summary": "This protocol is designed to investigate the use of novel techniques in MRI that may not yet be commercially available. Specifically, the protocol enables patients to take advantage of new pulse sequence software, coil design or post processing capabilities not otherwise available. The informed consent explains MRI in lay terms, describes the use of contrast agents and lists contraindications to MRI.", "detailed_description": "NMR imaging promises to provide useful and unique diagnostic information in a variety of diseases. In an attempt to evaluate its role, we plan to study a wide range of diseases during the initial year of imaging. Exposure to magnetic fields and radiofrequency energies of this magnitude have demonstrated no deleterious effects clinically or in the laboratory. The only restrictions will be those imposed by ferromagnetic objects within the patient which would increase the risk of placing them in a strong magnetic field.", "condition": "Diagnostic Imaging", "criteria": "Any patient undergoing MRI for research or clinical purposes who is participating in a currently active NIH protocol. No patients with pacemakers, cochlear implants, implanted pumps, shrapnel, metal in the globe of the eye, cerebral aneurysm clips or other contraindication to MRI.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "Accepts Healthy Volunteers", "id": "NCT00001194.xml"}
