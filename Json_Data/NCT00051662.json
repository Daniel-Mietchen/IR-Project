Exclusion criteria: - Previous treatment with efalizumab. - Rheumatoid Factor positive without dactylitis or positive X-rays of the hands or feet, or with rheumatoid nodules. - History of joint replacement surgery within 60 days prior to the start of study drug dosing. - Joint replacement therapy planned within nine months subsequent to the start of study drug dosing. - Intra-articular cortisone injections within 28 days prior to the start of study drug dosing. - Pregnancy or lactation. - History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions to humanized or murine monoclonal antibodies. Respiratory distress (dyspnea, oxygen desaturation with pO2 < 90% or onset of acute respiratory distress syndrome), flank or back pain, and/or hypotension may be signs of anaphylaxis. - Active bacterial, viral, fungal, mycobacterium tuberculosis or atypical mycobacterium infection. - Positive PPD test unless subject with positive PPD test completed a course of treatment for tuberculosis - History of any opportunistic infection. - History of a malignancy within the past five years. Subjects with a history of fully resolved, resected, basal or squamous cell carcinoma may be enrolled. - Received any vaccine within 28 days prior to the start of study drug dosing. - Chronic disorders apart from PsA affecting the joints, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, scleroderma or known reactive arthritis (e.g., Reiter\u2019s syndrome). - COPD, asthma, or other pulmonary disease requiring more therapy than using one inhaler 4\u00d7 daily. - Failed to respond or maintain response to Enbrel. - Received any DMARD other than methotrexate or sulfasalazine during the 28 days prior to the start of study drug dosing. - Approved biologic PsA therapy during the 28 days or seven half-lives of the drug prior to the start of study drug dosing, whichever is the greater length of time; Enbrel within 42 days prior to the start of study drug dosing. - Investigational drug and/or treatment during the 28 days or 7 half-lives of the drug prior to the start of study drug dosing, whichever is the greater length of time. - Any condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would jeopardize the subject\u2019s safety following exposure to efalizumab. - Liver disease (e.g., hepatitis, cirrhosis) or abnormal hepatic function (AST or ALT \u2265 2.5 - ULN). - Serum creatinine level \u2265 1.5 mg/dL - Platelet count \u2264 125,000 cells/mm3 - WBC count \u2264 3,500 cells/mm3 - Total lymphocyte count \u2264 1000 cells/mm3 - Seropositive for hepatitis B - Seropositive for hepatitis C antibody - Seropositive for HIV - Antinuclear antibodies titer \u2265 1:80 - History of inflammatory bowel disease", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "80 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "mesh_term": ["Arthritis", "Arthritis, Psoriatic"], "id": "NCT00051662"}
