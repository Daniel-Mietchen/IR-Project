{"brief_title": "Trastuzumab Plus Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining monoclonal antibody therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab plus carboplatin and paclitaxel in treating patients who have advanced non-small cell lung cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the toxicity of monoclonal antibody HER2 with carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with HER2 positive non-small cell lung cancer. II. Determine median time to progression and one year freedom from progression in this patient population. III. Evaluate one year survival rate and overall objective response rate in this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours immediately followed by carboplatin IV over 30 minutes immediately followed by monoclonal antibody HER2 IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive monoclonal antibody HER2 on days 8 and 15. Treatment is repeated every 3 weeks for 6 courses. After 6 courses of treatment, patients may receive monoclonal antibody HER2 weekly for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years and once a year thereafter until disease progression or death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-44 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": "Lung Cancer", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "paclitaxel", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) Recurrent AND/OR Stage IIIB with pleural or pericardial effusion OR Stage IV Must have at least one bidimensionally measurable lesion Must be HER2 positive (1-3+) Brain metastases allowed, if symptoms controlled and not requiring steroids Prior/Concurrent Therapy-- Biologic therapy: Not specified Chemotherapy: No prior chemotherapy for NSCLC Endocrine therapy: No concurrent steroids Radiotherapy: At least 2 weeks since prior radiotherapy Surgery: Not specified PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: 18 and over Performance status: ECOG 0-1 Life expectancy: Not specified Hematopoietic: Absolute neutrophil count at least 1,500/mm3 Platelet count at least 100,000/mm3 Hepatic: Bilirubin no greater than 1.5 mg/dL Transaminases no greater than 5 times upper limit of normal Renal: Creatinine no greater than 2 mg/dL Cardiovascular: No uncontrolled angina pectoris and arrhythmias No myocardial infarction within past 3 months No uncompensated congestive heart failure Ejection fraction at least 45% Other: No active infections Not pregnant or nursing Fertile patients must use effective contraception HIV negative No other active malignancies No evidence of peripheral sensory neuropathy of at least grade 2", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00003881.xml"}
