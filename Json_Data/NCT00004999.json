{"brief_title": "Effectiveness of a New Anti-HIV Drug (AG1549) Plus Viracept (Nelfinavir) Plus Combivir (Zidovudine/Lamivudine) in HIV-Infected Patients", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to look at the effectiveness of giving a new anti-HIV drug (AG1549) plus Viracept (nelfinavir) plus Combivir (a tablet containing zidovudine plus lamivudine) to HIV-infected patients who are not taking anti-HIV drugs.", "detailed_description": "[Note: As of 2/28/2001, due to toxicity studies and concerns for safety, sites were notified that they need to discontinue patients from the capravirine/placebo arms and continue patients with their background therapies or switch patients to new therapies, as deemed appropriate by the investigators.] Patients are randomized to receive Viracept plus Combivir plus either AG1549 or placebo. Patients remain on their assigned therapy for 48 weeks with one post-therapy follow-up visit. Blood samples are taken regularly to quantify plasma HIV-1 RNA, CD4 and CD8 counts, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Physical exams, safety assessments, and other tests are also done throughout the study. A blood sample is taken at baseline (pre-dose) for a pharmacokinetics assessment. On Day 8 and at the end of Weeks 4, 8, 16, 24, 36, and 48, pharmacokinetic sampling is done prior to dosing and between 2 to 4 hours post-dose.", "condition": "HIV Infections", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Nelfinavir mesylate", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria Patients may be eligible if they: - Are HIV-positive. - Are at least 18 years old. - Have a CD4 cell count of more than 50 cells/mm3. - Have an HIV level of more than 5000 copies/ml.
