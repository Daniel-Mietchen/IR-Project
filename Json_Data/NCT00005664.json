{"brief_title": "Evaluation of Patients With Endocrine-Related Conditions", "brief_summary": "This study will evaluate patients with a variety of endocrine disorders in order to 1) learn more about conditions that affect the endocrine glands (glands that secrete hormones) and 2) to train physicians in endocrinology. Patients of all ages with endocrine-related conditions may be eligible for evaluation under this protocol. Those enrolled may be required to provide blood, saliva, urine or stool samples, and to undergo ultrasound examination of the thyroid gland, ovaries or testes, adrenal glands or other parts of the body. Laboratory or X-ray studies may be done for diagnostic or treatment purposes. In some cases, patients will receive medical or surgical treatment for their disorder. Patients and family members of patients with a hereditary disorder may be asked to provide a blood sample for genetic analysis.", "detailed_description": "This protocol is designed to allow inpatient and outpatient evaluation of patients with a variety of endocrine disorders for purposes of research and physician education in our accredited endocrinology training programs, and to allow for small pilot studies in normal volunteers. The research-directed evaluations may include blood, saliva, urine or stool samples, and/or ultrasound examinations. In some patients with endocrine disorders, laboratory or radiological studies will be performed to confirm the diagnosis or to aid in the management of the patient, as would be done in current clinical practice. In some cases, the patient will receive medical or surgical treatment for their disorder. The purpose of these evaluations or treatments will be to support our clinical training or research missions.", "condition": "Obesity", "criteria": "- INCLUSION CRITERIA: Patients of all ages with endocrine-related conditions will be eligible for this protocol. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Unstable patients and patients with severe organ failure that may affect/limit the endocrine work-up and exhaust Clinical Center and/or NICHD resources will be excluded if appropriate. Decisions will be made on a case by case basis by the principal and associate investigators.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "1 Month", "maximum_age": "100 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "Accepts Healthy Volunteers", "id": "NCT00005664.xml"}
