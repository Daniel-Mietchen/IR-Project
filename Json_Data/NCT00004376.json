Patients are stratified by pubertal status. There is a 7- to 14-day washout with a placebo prior to treatment for all patients. The first group receives oral guanfacine 3 times a day for 8 weeks. The dose is gradually increased to minimize sedation; by day 14, most patients are stabilized and the dose is then increased as clinically indicated and tolerated. The second group receives a placebo 3 times a day for 8 weeks. Patients in either group may be treated with guanfacine for an additional 8 weeks.", "condition": "Tourette Syndrome", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "guanfacine", "criteria": "PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA: --Disease Characteristics-- - Tourette syndrome or other chronic tic disorder meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) criteria - DSM-IV diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) Clinician's Global Impression for ADHD greater than 4 Hyperactivity Index of Conners Parent or Teacher Questionnaire standard score 65 or higher (1.5 standard deviation units) --Prior/Concurrent Therapy-- - At least 2 weeks since medication for tics, ADHD, or obsessive compulsive disorder (4 weeks since neuroleptics or fluoxetine) - No failure on prior guanfacine --Patient Characteristics-- - Hepatic: No liver failure - Renal: No renal failure - Cardiovascular: No hypertension No other heart disease - Pulmonary: No pulmonary disease - Other: No Intelligence Quotient below 80 No current DSM-IV diagnosis of the following: Major depression Bipolar disorder Pervasive developmental disorder Psychotic disorder No seizure disorder No other significant medical condition No pregnant women", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "7 Years", "maximum_age": "16 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00004376.xml"}
