{"brief_title": "Study of the Nutritional, Metabolic, and Body Composition Profile in Children and Adolescents With Epidermolysis Bullosa", "brief_summary": "OBJECTIVES: I. Characterize the nutritional and metabolic profile of children and adolescents with epidermolysis bullosa. II. Determine patterns of body composition in these patients. III. Determine the energy requirements of these patients by measuring resting energy expenditure. IV. Assess protein nutrition by measuring lean body mass.", "detailed_description": "PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Data collected from a 5-day food diary are analyzed for protein, nutrient, and calorie intake. Nutritional, metabolic, and body composition are evaluated by indirect calorimetry, total body electrical conductivity, total body potassium, and lean body mass.", "condition": ["Epidermolysis Bullosa"], "criteria": "PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA: - Epidermolysis bullosa - Patient age: 2 months to 18 years", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "18 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "rare disease", "mesh_term": ["Epidermolysis Bullosa"], "id": "NCT00004791"}
