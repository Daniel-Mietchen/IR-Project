{"brief_title": "Comparison of Teriparatide With Alendronate for Treating Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis", "brief_summary": "Osteoporosis is a condition in which the amount of bone is reduced, the bones are weak, and there is an increased risk for fractures. Glucocorticoids (such as prednisone) are prescribed to treat a large number of conditions such as arthritis and asthma. When taken for several months or longer, glucocorticoids can cause bone loss and lead to a form of osteoporosis called \"glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.\" This study compared the effects of teriparatide, the study drug, with alendronate, an approved drug for treating glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.", "condition": "Osteoporosis", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Placebo", "description": "Injection placebo, daily, 36 months", "arm_group_label": "B", "other_name": "Forsteo", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Men or women age 21 years or older - Taking on average 5.0 mg/day prednisone or equivalent for at least 3 months prior to screening Exclusion Criteria: - Taking bisphosphonates within past 6 months - More than 30 micrograms/day of estradiol or equivalent in past 3 months - History of alcoholism or drug abuse in past year - Pregnant women or nursing mothers", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "21 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00051558.xml"}
