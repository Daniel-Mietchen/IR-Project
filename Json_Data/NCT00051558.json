{"brief_title": "Comparison of Teriparatide With Alendronate for Treating Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis", "brief_summary": "Osteoporosis is a condition in which the amount of bone is reduced, the bones are weak, and there is an increased risk for fractures. Glucocorticoids (such as prednisone) are prescribed to treat a large number of conditions such as arthritis and asthma. When taken for several months or longer, glucocorticoids can cause bone loss and lead to a form of osteoporosis called \"glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.\" This study compared the effects of teriparatide, the study drug, with alendronate, an approved drug for treating glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.", "condition": ["Osteoporosis"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Teriparatide", "Alendronate Sodium", "Placebo", "Placebo"], "description": ["20 micrograms/day, injection, 36 months", "10 mg/day, oral, 36 months", "Oral placebo, daily, 36 months", "Injection placebo, daily, 36 months"], "arm_group_label": ["A", "B", "A", "B"], "other_name": ["LY333334", "Forteo", "Forsteo"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Men or women age 21 years or older - Taking on average 5.0 mg/day prednisone or equivalent for at least 3 months prior to screening Exclusion Criteria: - Taking bisphosphonates within past 6 months - More than 30 micrograms/day of estradiol or equivalent in past 3 months - History of alcoholism or drug abuse in past year - Pregnant women or nursing mothers", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "21 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "mesh_term": ["Osteoporosis", "Glucocorticoids", "Alendronate", "Teriparatide"], "id": "NCT00051558"}
