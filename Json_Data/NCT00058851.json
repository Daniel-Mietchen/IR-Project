{"brief_title": "Massage Therapy for Breast Cancer Treatment-Related Swelling of the Arms", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to examine the short-term and long-term efficacy of massage therapy alone compared to massage therapy plus compression bandaging in the treatment of breast cancer treatment-related swelling of the arms and legs.", "detailed_description": "Massage therapy (in the form of manual lymph drainage [MLD]) and compression bandaging (CB) are integral components of combined physical therapy (CPT), the recommended treatment for peripheral lymphedema (LE). According to the World Health Organization, LE afflicts hundreds of millions worldwide and probably millions in the United States. Effects of various forms of massage on lymph circulation have been postulated for more than a century, but the efficacy of MLD alone without CB has not been demonstrated. New data suggest that MLD alone reduces established LE volume as effectively as CB in combination with CPT and minimizes LE development. Patients will be randomly assigned to either treatment with MLD alone or a combination of MLD and CB. Patients will be treated in 10 one-hour sessions over 2 weeks. They will also undergo lymphangioscintigraphy (a nuclear medicine test) to depict the function of their lymphatic system. Patients will continue self treatment at home and will be followed for 6 months.", "condition": ["Lymphedema"], "intervention_type": ["Procedure", "Procedure", "Procedure"], "intervention_name": ["Manual lymph drainage", "Combined physiotherapy", "Compression bandaging"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Lymphedema (5% to 20% increase in volume) after breast cancer treatment Exclusion Criteria: - Physically unable to perform massage or bandaging during home program", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "Combined physiotherapy", "mesh_term": ["Lymphedema"], "id": "NCT00058851"}
