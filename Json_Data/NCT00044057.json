{"brief_title": "A Study to Evaluate the Effects of YM872 on Brain Function and Disability When Administered in Combination With Alteplase (Tissue Plasminogen Activator)", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to determine if YM872 in combination with t-PA can reduce disability and brain damage from stroke. YM872 or placebo will be given as a continuous intravenous (iv) infusion for 24 hours. It is important that the study medication, YM872 or placebo, is administered prior to the completion of the t-PA administration. The clinical effects of YM872 in addition to t-PA will be determined by assessing neurological function and disability scores at follow up visits through Day 90 of the study.", "condition": ["Acute Ischemic Stroke"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["YM872 (zonampanel), t-PA (alteplase)"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Patients with acute ischemic stroke who are treated with alteplase within 3 hours of stroke onset (Onset is defined as the time that which the patient was last seen in a normal state, or bedtime for unwitnessed strokes occurring during the night). - Patients who are able to provide written informed consent or have consent provided by a legally authorized representative. - Patients who are at least 18 years of age. - Patients who have a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of at least 7 but not more than 23 and who are conscious. - Other criteria as specified in the study protocol Exclusion Criteria: - Patients who are not eligible to receive treatment with alteplase (t-PA) due to brain hemorrhage, risk for hemorrhage, or other criteria. - Patients who have stroke of the brainstem or cerebellum. - Patients who have renal (kidney) disease or insufficiency. - Patients who have active epilepsy or convulsions during the current stroke episode. - Patients who are IV drug users or are inebriated. - Patients who have a history of drug-related anaphylaxis. - Patients who have taken sedatives, anticonvulsants, or any medication with sedating effects in the 10 days prior study enrollment. - Patients who have taken more than 1.3 g of aspirin per day in the 2 days prior to enrollment. - Patients who have a known vitamin hypersensitivity. - Other exclusion criteria as specified by the study protocol", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "ARTIST", "mesh_term": ["Stroke", "Ischemia", "Plasminogen", "Tissue Plasminogen Activator"], "id": "NCT00044057"}
