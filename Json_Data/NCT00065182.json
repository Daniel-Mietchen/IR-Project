In addition, subjects are allowed to have previously received a non-cytotoxic therapy, such as an endothelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) or angiogenesis inhibitor. - Presence of either measurable or non-measurable disease by radiologic study or physical examination. - Full recovery and at least 21 days from prior treatment for NSCLC; 42 days from treatment with mitomycin or nitrosureas and 30 days from prior non-cytotoxic therapy. - At least 3 weeks since last major surgery (a lesser period is acceptable if deemed in the best interest of the patient). - At least 7 days since prior radiotherapy. - A probable life expectance of at least 3 months. - Adequate bone marrow reserve, CBC/Platelet, kidney and liver function. Exclusion criteria: - Concomitant malignancies or other malignancies within the last five years. - Symptoms of brain metastases requiring treatment with steroids. - Active infection. - Severe medical problems other than the diagnosis of NSCLC that would limit the ability of the subject to follow study guidelines or expose the subject to extreme risk. - Ongoing or planned chemotherapy (other than treatment during this study), immunotherapy, radiotherapy, or investigational therapy for the treatment of NSCLC. - Use of investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half-lives prior to the first dose of study medication. - Women who are pregnant or lactating. - Subjects of child-bearing potential refusing to practice adequate contraception. - Prior treatment with or history of allergic reaction to either HYCAMTIN or TAXOTERE. - Subjects who cannot receive steroid premedication.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00065182.xml"}
