{"brief_title": "Decompression Intervention of Variceal Rebleeding Trial (DIVERT)", "brief_summary": "The Decompression Intervention of Variceal Rebleeding Trial (DIVERT) is a multi-center prospective randomized clinical trial comparing the radiologic procedure of transjugular intrahepatic portal-systemic shunt (TIPS) with the surgical procedure of distal splenorenal shunt (DSRS) for variceal bleeding in patients with Child's Class A and B cirrhosis. This is recognized nationally and internationally as the study that will answer the question as to which of these is the best treatment for decompression of varices in patients who have failed endoscopic and pharmacologic therapy.", "condition": "Liver Cirrhosis", "intervention_type": "Procedure", "intervention_name": "Distal Splenorenal Shunt", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Variceal bleeding secondary to cirrhosis and portal hypertension - Child's Class A or B cirrhosis of any etiology - Patients who have failed endoscopic therapy (sclerotherapy or banding) of varices; or patients who are not candidates for endoscopic therapy Exclusion Criteria: - Prior shunt procedure - Portal vein thrombosis - Polycystic liver disease - Intractable ascites - Prior organ transplant - Any medical intractable disease", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00006161.xml"}
