{"brief_title": "Carmustine Plus O6-benzylguanine in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Progressive Glioma", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining carmustine and O6-benzylguanine in treating patients who have recurrent or progressive glioma.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the activity of carmustine and O6-benzylguanine in patients with recurrent or progressive glioblastoma multiforme, anaplastic astrocytoma, or gliosarcoma resistant to nitrosourea. II. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive O6-benzylguanine IV over 1 hour, followed 1 hour later by carmustine IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-32 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18 months.", "condition": "Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "carmustine", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed recurrent or progressive glioblastoma multiforme, anaplastic astrocytoma, or gliosarcoma Resistant to nitrosourea (defined as progressive or recurrent disease within 8 weeks of receiving nitrosourea) Measurable residual disease by MRI or CT scan PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: 18 and over Performance status: Karnofsky 60-100% Life expectancy: Not specified Hematopoietic: Absolute granulocyte count at least 1,500/mm3 Platelet count at least 100,000/mm3 Hemoglobin greater than 10 g/dL Hepatic: Bilirubin normal SGOT no greater than 2.5 times upper limit of normal Renal: Creatinine no greater than 1.5 mg/dL BUN no greater than 25 mg/dL Pulmonary: DLCO greater than 80% predicted Other: Not pregnant or nursing Fertile patients must use effective contraception during and for 2 months after study PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: Not specified Chemotherapy: See Disease Characteristics At least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy At least 6 weeks since prior nitrosourea, procarbazine, or mitomycin and recovered No prior nitrosourea greater than 1,200 mg/m2 Endocrine therapy: Concurrent stable dose corticosteroids allowed if on for at least two weeks prior to study Radiotherapy: At least 4 weeks since prior radiotherapy Surgery: Not specified", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00005081.xml"}
