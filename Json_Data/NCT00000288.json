{"brief_title": "Role of Metabolites in Nicotine Dependence (2) - 5", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of varying doses of cotinine on cigarette self-administration.", "detailed_description": "Previous studies have shown that cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine, antagonizes some of the effects of nicotine. One study showed that nicotine eliminates some of the beneficial effects of the nicotine patch in reducing withdrawal symptoms. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of cotinine. The results generally showed no effects on self-administration of cigarettes, although higher serum nicotine levels were observed on the highest doses of cotinine compared to placebo or lower doses of cotinine.", "condition": "Tobacco Use Disorder", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Cotinine fumarate", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: Male/Female subjects ages 21-45 yrs. inclusive, with a smoking history of at least 1 pack of cigarettes daily for at least 1 year.
