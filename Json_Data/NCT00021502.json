{"brief_title": "Safety and Efficacy of PHP in the Treatment of Shock Associated With Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS)", "brief_summary": "To determine the safety and effectiveness of pyridoxylated hemoglobin polyoxyethylene conjugate (PHP) administered by continuous intravenous (IV) infusion in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) patients with shock. PHP is a human-derived chemically modified hemoglobin preparation. PHP selectively scavenges excess nitric oxide (NO) and does so in a catalytic, concentration-dependent reaction that results in the formation of the non-toxic NO metabolite, nitrate. PHP is postulated to reduce excess, toxic levels of NO while allowing critical beneficial levels of the molecule to persist.", "detailed_description": "This Phase 3, randomized, placebo controlled, multi-center study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of continuous IV infusion of PHP plus conventional vasopressor treatment, as compared to continuous IV infusion of Plasma-Lyte A plus conventional vasopressor, as a treatment for restoring hemodynamic stability in SIRS patients with shock. Conventional vasopressors include dopamine > 5 mcg/kg/min; or norepinephrine, phenylephrine or epinephrine at any dose. The study consists of a Screening period, a Pre-Treatment period, and a 28-day Treatment period. Efficacy will be determined by evaluating objective clinical measures of mortality and organ function over the 28-day treatment period. The safety and tolerability of PHP will be evaluated over the continuous 28 days using a number of measures including an evaluation of: - all cause mortality, - median patient survival time and - adverse event rates and duration.", "condition": ["Shock", "Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["pyridoxalated hemoglobin polyoxyethylene conjugate (PHP)"], "criteria": "Determination of study eligibility will be made by the Investigator on the basis of the inclusion criteria listed below: SIRS Inclusion Criteria Patients with SIRS as characterized by two or more of the following conditions (worst values in a 24 hour period): - Either respiratory rate >/= 20 breaths/minute, partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2) </= 32 torr, or mechanical ventilation, - Heart rate >/= 90 beats/minute, - Either hyperthermia >/= 38 degrees C, or hypothermia </= 36 degrees C or - Either white blood cell (WBC) >/= 12,000 cells/mm3, </= 4,000 cells/mm3, or >/= 10% immature (band) forms Shock Inclusion Criteria Patients with adequate fluid resuscitation (PCWP >/= 12mmHg) and with one or more conventional vasopressors (continuing up to the time of randomization) being used to treat hypotension (MBP < 60 mmHg or SBP < 90 mmHg).
