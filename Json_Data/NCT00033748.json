{"brief_title": "Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Colorectal Cancer Metastatic to the Liver", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy in treating patients who have colorectal cancer that has spread to the liver.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the 2-year recurrence-free survival of patients with minimal metastatic colorectal cancer after hepatic resection when treated with adjuvant monoclonal antibody 3H1 anti-idiotype vaccine and monoclonal antibody 11D10 anti-idiotype vaccine. Secondary - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Beginning 6-12 weeks after curative hepatic resection, patients receive monoclonal antibody 3H1 anti-idiotype vaccine and monoclonal antibody 11D10 anti-idiotype vaccine intracutaneously at separate sites on days 1, 15, 29, and 45, then subcutaneously monthly for 4 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 63 patients will be accrued for this study within 9 months.", "condition": ["Colorectal Cancer", "Metastatic Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Biological", "Biological"], "intervention_name": ["monoclonal antibody 11D10 anti-idiotype", "monoclonal antibody 3H1 Alu Gel"], "description": ["2 mg intradermal injection q 14 days for 4 doses, then sub Q monthly for 4 months, following a 6-12 wk rest period after curative hepatic resection", "2 mg intradermal injection q 14 days for 4 doses, then sub Q monthly for 4 months, following a 6-12 wk rest period after curative hepatic resection"], "arm_group_label": ["Combined Monoclonal Antibody Therapy", "Combined Monoclonal Antibody Therapy"], "other_name": ["TriAb", "CeaVac"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed hepatic colorectal metastases - Must have undergone complete resection of hepatic colorectal metastases with tumor-free margins (curative resection) at least 6, but no more than 10, weeks prior to study entry - No evaluable or measurable disease after hepatic resection, documented by intraoperative palpation or imaging studies including intraoperative ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI - No hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer type B - No CNS metastases PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 and over Performance status: - CTC 0-2 Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - WBC at least 4,000/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 150,000/mm^3 Hepatic: - Bilirubin no greater than 2 mg/dL - AST no greater than 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) Renal: - Creatinine no greater than 1.5 times ULN Gastrointestinal: - No celiac disease - No familial polyposis - No Gardner's syndrome - No Peutz-Jeghers syndrome Other: - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception - No seizure disorders requiring continuous medication - No history of clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions, including known hypersensitivity to rodent proteins - No other malignancy within the past 5 years except adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix or nonmelanoma skin cancer PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - No prior murine antibodies (e.g., oncoscint scan) - No prior monoclonal antibody 3H1 anti-idiotype vaccine or monoclonal antibody 11D10 anti-idiotype vaccine Chemotherapy: - No concurrent chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: - No concurrent hormonal therapy except steroids for adrenal failure or hormones for non-disease-related conditions (e.g., insulin for diabetes) Radiotherapy: - Not specified Surgery: - See Disease Characteristics Other: - Prior treatment for primary lesion or hepatic metastases allowed - No concurrent immunomodulatory therapy", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "liver metastases", "mesh_term": ["Colorectal Neoplasms", "Neoplasm Metastasis", "Antibodies", "Immunoglobulins", "Antibodies, Monoclonal", "Immunoglobulin Idiotypes"], "id": "NCT00033748"}
