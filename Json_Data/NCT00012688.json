Goals of diabetes care include the prevention and/or delay of complications via adequate glycemic control. Improvements in periodontal status may also improve diabetes control. Objectives: This project will determine the efficacy of a program of periodontal screening and therapy in improving the level of glycemic control in poorly controlled diabetics.
