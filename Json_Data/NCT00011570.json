{"brief_title": "Electrical Control of Bladder in Spinal Cord Injury Patients", "brief_summary": "The investigators will continue their work with implanted stimulators to improve bladder and bowel function. Electrical stimulation produces simultaneous contraction of sphincters with the target organs, making emptying difficult. By optimizing electrode placement, employing a new electrode design and waveform choice, it is hoped to improve the 50% of subjects able to defecate with existing approaches. This is part of a multi-center study with multiple support sources, including Rehab R&D, PVA and a commercial stimulator company.", "condition": ["Spinal Cord Injury"], "intervention_type": ["Device"], "intervention_name": ["Bladder & Bowel Control"], "arm_group_label": ["1"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: Spinal cord injury with bowel & bladder problems Exclusion Criteria:", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "urology", "mesh_term": ["Wounds and Injuries", "Spinal Cord Injuries"], "id": "NCT00011570"}
