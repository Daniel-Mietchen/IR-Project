{"brief_title": "S0002 - A Program to Quit Smoking With or Without Bupropion in Treating Patients With Stage I or II Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Who Have Undergone Surgery", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: A program that includes bupropion may be more effective in helping early-stage lung cancer patients to quit smoking. It is not yet known if a program to quit smoking is more effective with or without bupropion. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of a program to quit smoking with or without bupropion in treating patients who have undergone surgery for stage I or stage II non-small cell lung cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Compare the effect of a smoking cessation intervention comprising behavior intervention and nicotine replacement with or without bupropion on 12-month quit rates in patients with completely resected stage I or II non-small cell lung cancer who are current smokers. - Compare the predictors of smoking cessation success in patients treated with these regimens. - Determine the relationship between smoking cessation and standard outcome measures (e.g., second malignancies, survival, and symptom status) in patients treated with these regimens. - Compare the effect of these treatment regimens on emotional functioning in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to gender, prior neoadjuvant or concurrent adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy (yes vs no), and time since prior surgery (less than 6 months vs 6 to 12 months vs more than 12 months). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. All patients receive behavioral intervention comprising smoking cessation advice and education on day 1. Patients quit smoking on day 8. Patients then receive a nicotine transdermal patch once daily on days 8-77. - Arm I: Patients receive oral bupropion once daily on days 1-3 and twice daily on days 4-77. - Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo as in arm I. Patients are followed at 3, 6, and 12 months and then annually for 10 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 468 patients (234 [117 men and 117 women] per arm) will be accrued for this study within 3 years.", "condition": "Lung Cancer", "intervention_type": "Procedure", "intervention_name": "psychosocial assessment and care", "description": "The nurse/CRA will debrief the patients after the brief physician intervention and will follow-up with a series of 5 phone calls to provide booster advice.
