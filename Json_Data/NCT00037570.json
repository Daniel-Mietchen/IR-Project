{"brief_title": "Study Evaluating Pantoprazole in Peptic Ulcer Hemorrhage", "brief_summary": "This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, dose-ranging, comparator-controlled study of the effect of pantoprazole on intragastric pH after successful endoscopic hemostasis in hospitalized patients. Patients will receive either intravenous pantoprazole (one of two regimens) or ranitidine (the comparator) within 2 hours of successful hemostasis and administration will continue for 72 hours after hemostasis.", "condition": ["Peptic Ulcer Hemorrhage"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Pantoprazole"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Patients must be men or nonpregnant women at least 18 years of age - Patients who present with a gastric or duodenal ulcer (major dimension of the ulcer must be \u2265 5 mm and \u2264 20 mm) with endoscopic appearance of spurting, oozing, or nonbleeding visible vessel (NBVV) Patients presenting with adherent protruding clot are eligible if, after removal of the clot by irrigation, the underlying lesion is classified as spurting, oozing or a NBVV.
