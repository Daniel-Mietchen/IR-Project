{"brief_title": "Study of Two Complementary and Alternative Medical Treatments for Maintenance of Weight Loss", "brief_summary": "The goal of this study is to pilot test in a group of overweight-obese individuals the feasibility and acceptability and indications of efficacy of two CAM treatments, qigong, and acupressure-TAT, for improving long term maintenance of weight loss.", "detailed_description": "The prevalence of obesity is at epidemic proportions, 60% of US adults are overweight or obese. Obesity contributes to chronic diseases (diabetes, cardiovascular disease [CVD], hypertension, cancer, and osteoarthritis) and to escalating health care costs. Weight loss can have a substantial impact on reducing these conditions. Substantial efforts have been made in developing effective short-term weight loss programs using behavioral treatments. However, long-term maintenance of weight loss continues to be problematic - many individuals regain the weight lost within a year. Innovative intervention options are critically needed to help people successfully maintain weight loss and to fight the obesity epidemic. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) approaches-mind-body, energy healing, and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) approaches may hold great promise for helping improve the maintenance of weight loss.", "condition": ["Obesity"], "intervention_type": ["Behavioral", "Behavioral"], "intervention_name": ["qigong", "acupressure-TAT"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - BMI 25-35 kg/m 2 - Reside in Portland metropolitan area - Willing to complete the 12-week weight loss program - Willing to accept random assignment to one of the three maintenance treatment conditions - Willing to provide informed consent Exclusion Criteria: - Medical conditions or treatments that would be contraindicated using a diet & exercise weight loss treatment - Cancer - Significant GI disease inappropriate for diet and physical activity intervention - Diabetes dependent on insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications - Psychiatric hospitalization in past 2 years - Conditions that require limitation of physical activity - Congestive Heart Failure - Cardiovascular Disease (stroke, MI, CABG, ASCVD) - Taking weight loss medications currently or within past 6 months - Previous history of complementary or alternative medicine (CAM) weight loss treatment - Current acupressure, or Qi Gong, or acupuncture - Reported consumption of more than 21 alcoholic drinks per week - Planning to leave the area prior to the end of the program - Body weight change > 10 pounds in the 6 months prior to Screening visit one - Pregnant, breast feeding, or planning pregnancy prior to the end of participation - Current participation in another clinical trial - Investigator discretion for safety or adherence reasons - Household member of another CAM WT participant - Unavailable for group sessions", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "80 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "Accepts Healthy Volunteers", "keyword": "Traditional Chinese Medicine", "mesh_term": ["Weight Loss"], "id": "NCT00069732"}
