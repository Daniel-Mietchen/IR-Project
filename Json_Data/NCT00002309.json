Patients must have: - HIV infection. - CD4 count < 100 cells/mm3. - No MAC positive blood cultures within 1 month prior to study entry. - No symptoms suggestive of disseminated MAC infection (including unexplained diarrhea, fever, and night sweats) within 1 month of study entry. Exclusion Criteria Co-existing Condition: Patients with the following symptoms or conditions are excluded: - Positive PPD within 3 months prior to study entry (negative PPD defined as < 5 mm induration). - Chest x-ray suggestive of any active disease, in particular tuberculosis. - Known hypersensitivity to macrolide antibiotics. - Any other acute clinical condition likely to interfere with completion of the protocol. - Inability to care for self without considerable assistance and medical care. Concurrent Medication: Excluded: - Other investigational new drugs (except for foscarnet or ddC) unless prior agreement has been reached between the investigator and the Pfizer project physician. - Concomitant putative immunostimulants. Patients with the following prior conditions are excluded: History of MAC or Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb) infection. Prior Medication: Excluded within the past 4 weeks: - Any putative anti-MAC therapies including rifampin, rifabutin, clofazimine, ethambutol, cycloserine, ethionamide, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin or other quinolones thought to be active against MAC.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "Azithromycin", "mesh_term": ["Infection", "Communicable Diseases", "HIV Infections", "Mycobacterium Infections", "Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare Infection"], "id": "NCT00002309"}
