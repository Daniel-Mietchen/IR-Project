{"brief_title": "Insulin Action: Role of Skeletal Muscle and Insulin-Mediated Blood Flow", "brief_summary": "The overall objective of this proposal is to examine the contribution of changes in total body fat, enhancement in insulin-mediated vasodilatation and enhancement in endothelium-derived nitric oxide production to the improvements in metabolic insulin action. In addition, the study will track whether these improvements are related to changes in blood pressure.", "condition": ["Hypertension"], "criteria": "Age 50 - 75 years, elevated blood pressure, BMI greater than 25 but less than 40 kg/m2", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "50 Years", "maximum_age": "75 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "Accepts Healthy Volunteers", "keyword": "blood flow", "mesh_term": ["Insulin, Globin Zinc", "Insulin"], "id": "NCT00018304"}
