{"brief_title": "Familial Atherosclerosis Treatment Study", "brief_summary": "To compare the effects of two intensive lipid-lowering regimens with conventional therapy on coronary atherosclerosis as assessed by arteriography.", "detailed_description": "BACKGROUND: For several decades, clinical trials have addressed the question of whether treatment of hyperlipidemia reduces the risk of cardiovascular events. Substantial evidence supports the idea that cardiovascular benefits are related to the degree of reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level and perhaps to the degree of increase in the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level. In these trials, changes in lipid levels have usually been small and the overall clinical benefits have been limited. The appearance in the 1980s of more effective treatments for hyperlipidemia, new arteriographic methods for assessing atherosclerosis, and new insights into atherogenesis permitted an objective investigation into whether the progression of atherosclerosis was retarded or reversed by lipid-lowering agents. The clinical trial was supported by a subproject within a program project grant. DESIGN NARRATIVE: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled. Baseline arteriograms were performed and fasting lipid samples drawn before heparinization. Patients were stratified for age below 45 years, cigarette smoking within the previous month, and lipid patterns including familial hypercholesterolemia and triglyceride levels. Patients were given dietary counseling and randomly assigned to one of three treatments: lovastatin (20 mg twice a day) and colestipol (10 g three times a day); niacin (1 g four times a day) and colestipol (10 g three times a day): or conventional therapy with placebo (or colestipol if the LDL cholesterol level was elevated). The primary endpoint was a measure of change in the severity of disease in the proximal coronary arteries as measured by quantitative arteriography.", "condition": ["Cardiovascular Diseases", "Coronary Arteriosclerosis", "Coronary Disease", "Heart Diseases", "Myocardial Ischemia"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Drug", "Other", "Other"], "intervention_name": ["lovastatin", "colestipol", "niacin", "Placebo for colestipol", "Placebo for lovastatin"], "description": ["Lovastatin was begun at a dose of 20 mg twice a day (in the morning and at bedtime).
