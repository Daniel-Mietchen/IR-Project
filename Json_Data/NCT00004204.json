{"brief_title": "Temozolomide in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Progressive Malignant Glioma", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of temozolomide in treating patients who have recurrent or progressive malignant glioma.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the progression-free survival and response rate of patients with recurrent or progressive malignant glioma treated with temozolomide. - Determine whether certain categories of malignant gliomas, such as oligodendroglioma, are more sensitive to temozolomide. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to histologic categories (recurrent glioblastoma multiforme [closed to accrual 11/30/01] vs recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma vs recurrent anaplastic oligodendroglioma). Patients receive oral temozolomide twice daily for 5 consecutive days. Courses repeat every 28 days for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.", "condition": "Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "temozolomide", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically proven recurrent or progressive malignant glioma of one of the following types: - Anaplastic oligodendroglioma or oligoastrocytoma - Anaplastic astrocytoma - Glioblastoma multiforme (stratum closed to accrual 11/30/01) - Patients who have failed radiotherapy are eligible - Measurable disease by CT scan or MRI PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 and over Performance status: - Karnofsky 70-100% Life expectancy: - At least 12 weeks Hematopoietic: - Absolute neutrophil count greater than 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count greater than 100,000/mm^3 - Hemoglobin greater than 10 g/dL Hepatic: - SGOT or SGPT less than 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) - Alkaline phosphatase less than 2 times ULN (if greater than 2 times ULN then a gamma glutamyl transferase test must be performed) Renal: - BUN less than 1.5 times ULN - Creatinine less than 1.5 times ULN Other: - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective barrier contraception - No other serious concurrent infection or other medical illness that would preclude study entry - No frequent vomiting or partial bowel obstruction - HIV negative - No AIDS-related illness - No other concurrent malignancy except carcinoma in situ of the cervix or basal cell skin cancer PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - No concurrent epoetin alfa Chemotherapy: - At least 6 weeks since other prior chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: - Not specified Radiotherapy: - See Disease Characteristics - At least 3 months since prior radiotherapy (exceptions allowed for recurrent/progressive disease at discretion of primary investigator) Surgery: - Recovered from prior surgery Other: - No other concurrent investigational agents - Concurrent anticonvulsant therapy allowed", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00004204.xml"}
