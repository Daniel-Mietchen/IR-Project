{"brief_title": "MSI-1256F (Squalamine Lactate) in Combination With Verteporfin in Patients With \"Wet\" Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)", "brief_summary": "Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a degenerative disease of the retina that causes a progressive loss of central vision. AMD is the leading cause of legal blindness among adults age 50 or older in the Western world. AMD presents in two different types - \"dry\" and the more severe \"wet\" form. Wet AMD is caused by the growth of abnormal blood vessels in the macula. Squalamine lactate is an investigational drug that may prevent the growth of these abnormal blood vessels. This study will test the safety and efficacy of Squalamine when administered with verteporfin therapy in patients with \"wet\" AMD.", "condition": ["Macular Degeneration"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["MSI-1256F (Squalamine Lactate)"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Patients with a diagnosis of \"wet\" age-related macular degeneration Exclusion Criteria: - Prior treatment for \"wet\" age-related macular degeneration", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "50 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "Age-Related Macular Degeneration - Wet Type", "mesh_term": ["Macular Degeneration", "Verteporfin", "Squalamine"], "id": "NCT00094120"}
