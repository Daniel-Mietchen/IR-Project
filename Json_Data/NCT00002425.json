(This study provides only SQV.) Patients may not choose another protease inhibitor (PI) as part of their combination therapy; furthermore, patients taking PIs other than SQV must undergo a 5-day washout period before study-drug administration. Patients are monitored for adverse events and changes in routine laboratory tests, plasma viral load, and CD4+ T cell levels. Outcomes are analyzed by stratifying patients according to CD4+ T cell levels and prior history with protease inhibitors.", "condition": "HIV Infections", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Saquinavir", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria Concurrent Medication: Allowed: Antiretroviral treatments other than PIs. Patients must have: - HIV infection. - No prior experience with PIs. (Note: - At least 75 percent of patients must be naive to PIs.)
