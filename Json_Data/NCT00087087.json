{"brief_title": "Pemetrexed Disodium in Treating Patients With Ovarian Epithelial Cancer or Primary Peritoneal Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as pemetrexed disodium, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well pemetrexed disodium works in treating patients with recurrent or persistent ovarian epithelial cancer or primary peritoneal cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the antitumor activity of pemetrexed disodium in patients with recurrent or persistent platinum-resistant ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer that failed higher priority treatment protocols. - Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 7 days before and continuing until 3 weeks after the last dose of pemetrexed disodium, patients also receive oral folic acid daily and cyanocobalamin (vitamin B_12) intramuscularly every 9 weeks. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-51 patients will be accrued for this study within 11-22 months.", "condition": ["Ovarian Cancer", "Primary Peritoneal Cavity Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["pemetrexed disodium"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer - Recurrent or persistent disease - Measurable disease - At least 1 unidimensionally measurable target lesion \u2265 20 mm by conventional techniques (e.g., palpation, plain x-ray, CT scan, or MRI) OR \u2265 10 mm by spiral CT scan - Tumors within a previously irradiated field are considered non-target lesions - Must have received 1 prior platinum-based (carboplatin, cisplatin, or another organoplatinum compound) chemotherapy regimen for primary disease - Initial treatment may have included high-dose therapy, consolidation, or extended therapy administered after surgical or non-surgical assessment - Patients who had not received prior paclitaxel may have received a second regimen that included paclitaxel - Platinum-resistant or refractory disease - Treatment-free interval < 6 months after prior platinum-based therapy OR progressed during platinum-based therapy - Not eligible for a higher priority GOG protocol (i.e., any active phase III GOG protocol for the same patient population) PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - Any age Performance status - GOG 0-2 Life expectancy - Not specified Hematopoietic - Absolute neutrophil count \u2265 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count \u2265 100,000/mm^3 - Hemoglobin \u2265 9 g/dL Hepatic - Bilirubin \u2264 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) - Alkaline phosphatase \u2264 3 times ULN* - AST and ALT \u2264 3 times ULN* NOTE: * \u2264 5 times ULN if due to hepatic metastases Renal - Creatinine clearance \u2265 45 mL/min Other - No other malignancy within the past 5 years except nonmelanoma skin cancer - No neuropathy (sensory or motor) > grade 1 - No active infection requiring antibiotics - Not pregnant - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception during and for at least 3 months after study treatment PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - One prior noncytotoxic (biologic or cytostatic) regimen allowed for management of recurrent or refractory disease, including, but not limited to, the following: - Monoclonal antibodies - Cytokines - Small-molecule inhibitors of signal transduction - At least 3 weeks since prior biologic or immunologic therapy - At least 24 hours since prior growth factors - No concurrent routine colony-stimulating factors Chemotherapy - See Disease Characteristics - Recovered from prior chemotherapy - No prior cytotoxic chemotherapy for recurrent or persistent disease, including retreatment with initial chemotherapy regimens - No prior pemetrexed disodium Endocrine therapy - At least 1 week since prior hormonal therapy for the malignant tumor - Concurrent hormone replacement therapy allowed Radiotherapy - See Disease Characteristics - No prior radiotherapy to > 25% of bone marrow - At least 2 weeks since prior radiotherapy and recovered Surgery - Recovered from prior surgery Other - No prior cancer treatment that would preclude study participation - No non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for 2-5 days before, during, and for 1-2 days after study drug administration - Concurrent low-dose (\u2264 325 mg/day) aspirin allowed - At least 3 weeks since other prior therapy for the malignant tumor", "gender": "Female", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "primary peritoneal cavity cancer", "mesh_term": ["Peritoneal Neoplasms", "Pemetrexed"], "id": "NCT00087087"}
