{"brief_title": "Assessment of a B-Mode Ultrasound Technique for the Measurement of Carotid Artery Intima-Media Thickness", "brief_summary": "This minimal risk protocol is designed to assess the reproducibility of B-mode ultrasound measurements of carotid intima media thickness (IMT) when the scans are performed in CC Radiology and read using a computerized edge reader. Up to 20 volunteers will have two ultrasounds performed within a 6-month period. IMT thickness is used as a surrogate marker for atherosclerosis and may be of value in clinical trials.", "detailed_description": "This minimal risk protocol is designed to assess the reproducibility of B-mode ultrasound measurements of carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) when the scans are performed in CC Radiology and read using a computerized edge reader. Up to 50 volunteers will have two ultrasounds performed within a 6-month period. IMT thickness is used as a surrogate marker for atherosclerosis and may be of value in clinical trials.", "condition": ["Atherosclerosis", "Myocardial Infarction"], "criteria": "Adult (age 18 or older).
