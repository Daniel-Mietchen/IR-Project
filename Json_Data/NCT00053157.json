{"brief_title": "Sargramostim in Reducing Graft-Versus-Host Disease in Patients Who Are Undergoing Donor Stem Cell Transplantation for Hematologic Cancer or Aplastic Anemia", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Colony-stimulating factors such as sargramostim may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's immune system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Giving sargramostim to the stem cell donor and the patient may reduce the chance of developing graft-versus-host disease following stem cell transplantation. PURPOSE: Clinical trial to study the effectiveness of sargramostim in decreasing graft-versus-host disease in patients who are undergoing donor stem cell transplantation for hematologic cancer or aplastic anemia.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of sargramostim (GM-CSF) to mobilize CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells in donors and to reduce graft-vs-host disease in patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for hematologic malignancy or aplastic anemia. - Determine the safety of GM-CSF after allogeneic SCT transplantation in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a pilot study. - Donors: Donors receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) once daily on days 1-6. Donors undergo stem cell harvest on day 7. Donors may undergo up to 3 apheresis procedures to reach the target stem cell dose and may receive additional GM-CSF prior to each collection. - Patients: Patients receive conditioning therapy as per transplantation protocol RP98-15. Patients undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation on day 0. Patients then receive GM-CSF SC once daily beginning on day 7 and continuing until blood counts recover. Patients are followed weekly until day 100 and then at days 180 and 360. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients and 10 donors will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Chronic Myeloproliferative Disorders", "Graft Versus Host Disease", "Leukemia", "Lymphoma", "Myelodysplastic Syndromes", "Myelodysplastic/Myeloproliferative Neoplasms"], "intervention_type": ["Biological"], "intervention_name": ["sargramostim"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Diagnosis of a malignant hematologic disease, including: - Acute or chronic leukemia - Myelodysplastic syndromes - Myeloproliferative disorder - Hodgkin's lymphoma - Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma OR - Aplastic anemia - Planned transplantation on an RPCI IRB-approved allogeneic stem cell transplantation protocol - HLA-matched (6/6) related donor available PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - 5 to 60 Performance status - Not specified Life expectancy - Not specified Hematopoietic - Not specified Hepatic - Not specified Renal - Not specified Other - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients and donors must use effective contraception - No known allergy to GM-CSF - No prior of adverse reaction to any yeast recombinant molecule PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - See Disease Characteristics - No prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation Chemotherapy - Not specified Endocrine therapy - Not specified Radiotherapy - Not specified Surgery - Not specified", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "5 Years", "maximum_age": "60 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "childhood myelodysplastic syndromes", "mesh_term": ["Lymphoma", "Syndrome", "Leukemia", "Myelodysplastic Syndromes", "Preleukemia", "Graft vs Host Disease", "Myeloproliferative Disorders", "Myelodysplastic-Myeloproliferative Diseases"], "id": "NCT00053157"}
