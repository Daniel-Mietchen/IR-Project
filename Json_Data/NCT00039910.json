This investigational drug has been demonstrated to increase platelet counts. This study will test the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug in the prevention of thrombocytopenia in patients with recurrent or refractory intermediate-grade or high-grade non-Burkitt's, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), or Hodgkin's disease receiving DHAP (Dexamethasone, high-dose Cytarabine, and Cisplatin) chemotherapy.", "condition": ["Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Hodgkin Disease", "Thrombocytopenia"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["(PN-152,243)/ PN-196,444"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Patients must have recurrent or refractory intermediate-grade or high-grade non-Burkitt's, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) or Hodgkin's disease and be scheduled for a minimum of 2 cycles of DHAP (Dexamethasone, high-dose Cytarabine and Cisplatin) chemotherapy Exclusion Criteria: - Patients must not have active bleeding (exclusions do apply) or history of platelet disorder", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "mesh_term": ["Lymphoma", "Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin", "Thrombocytopenia", "Hodgkin Disease"], "id": "NCT00039910"}
