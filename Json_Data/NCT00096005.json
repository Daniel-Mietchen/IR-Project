{"brief_title": "Tanespimycin and Bortezomib in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors or Lymphomas", "brief_summary": "This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of giving tanespimycin together with bortezomib in treating patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas. (Accrual for lymphoma patients closed as of 11/27/09) Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as tanespimycin, work in different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth. It may also increase the effectiveness of tanespimycin by making cancer cells more sensitive to the drug. Combining tanespimycin with bortezomib may kill more cancer cells.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) (tanespimycin) and bortezomib in patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas (Accrual for Lymphoma Patients Closed as of 11/27/09). II. Determine changes in biomarkers (e.g., HSP70, client proteins, and ubiquitination of proteins) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tumor specimens from patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas (Accrual for Lymphoma Patients Closed as of 11/27/09) treated with this regimen. III. Determine responses in patients treated with this regimen. IV. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive tanespimycin intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours and bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tanespimycin and bortezomib until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, at least 12 additional patients are treated as above* at the MTD. NOTE: *Bortezomib is not administered on day 1 of course 1 only. Patients are followed at 3 months.", "condition": ["Adult Grade III Lymphomatoid Granulomatosis", "AIDS-related Peripheral/Systemic Lymphoma", "Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma", "Angioimmunoblastic T-cell Lymphoma", "Extranodal Marginal Zone B-cell Lymphoma of Mucosa-associated Lymphoid Tissue", "Nodal Marginal Zone B-cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Burkitt Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Diffuse Mixed Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Diffuse Small Cleaved Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Grade III Lymphomatoid Granulomatosis", "Recurrent Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Immunoblastic Large Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Lymphoblastic Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma", "Recurrent Cutaneous T-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Recurrent Grade 1 Follicular Lymphoma", "Recurrent Grade 2 Follicular Lymphoma", "Recurrent Grade 3 Follicular Lymphoma", "Recurrent Mantle Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Marginal Zone Lymphoma", "Recurrent Mycosis Fungoides/Sezary Syndrome", "Recurrent Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma", "Stage III Adult Burkitt Lymphoma", "Stage III Adult Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma", "Stage III Adult Diffuse Mixed Cell Lymphoma", "Stage III Adult Diffuse Small Cleaved Cell Lymphoma", "Stage III Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Stage III Adult Immunoblastic Large Cell Lymphoma", "Stage III Adult Lymphoblastic Lymphoma", "Stage III Adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma", "Stage III Cutaneous T-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Stage III Grade 1 Follicular Lymphoma", "Stage III Grade 2 Follicular Lymphoma", "Stage III Grade 3 Follicular Lymphoma", "Stage III Mantle Cell Lymphoma", "Stage III Marginal Zone Lymphoma", "Stage III Mycosis Fungoides/Sezary Syndrome", "Stage III Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Burkitt Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Diffuse Mixed Cell Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Diffuse Small Cleaved Cell Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Immunoblastic Large Cell Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Lymphoblastic Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma", "Stage IV Cutaneous T-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Stage IV Grade 1 Follicular Lymphoma", "Stage IV Grade 2 Follicular Lymphoma", "Stage IV Grade 3 Follicular Lymphoma", "Stage IV Mantle Cell Lymphoma", "Stage IV Marginal Zone Lymphoma", "Stage IV Mycosis Fungoides/Sezary Syndrome", "Stage IV Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma", "Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific", "Waldenstr\u00f6m Macroglobulinemia"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Other"], "intervention_name": ["tanespimycin", "bortezomib", "laboratory biomarker analysis"], "description": ["Given IV", "Given IV", "Correlative studies"], "arm_group_label": ["Treatment (chemotherapy and enzyme inhibitor therapy)", "Treatment (chemotherapy and enzyme inhibitor therapy)", "Treatment (chemotherapy and enzyme inhibitor therapy)"], "other_name": ["17-AAG", "LDP 341", "MLN341", "VELCADE"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: -
