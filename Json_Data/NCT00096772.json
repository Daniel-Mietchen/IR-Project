The Terry Beirn Community Programs for Clinical Research on AIDS (CPCRA) was created to conduct studies in HIV infected communities and particularly in people of color, women, and injection drug users. This study will collect whole blood samples from HIV infected individuals. The samples will be used in future CPCRA studies comparing human genetic factors with clinical data from other CPCRA studies.", "condition": "HIV Infections", "study_pop": "\n      ", "sampling_method": "Non-Probability Sample", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Presently participating, previously participated in, or has given informed consent for participation in a qualifying CPCRA clinical trial - Signed informed consent", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00096772.xml"}
