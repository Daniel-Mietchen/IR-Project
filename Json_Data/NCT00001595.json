{"brief_title": "An Investigation of Pituitary Tumors and Related Hypothalmic Disorders", "brief_summary": "There is a variety of tumors affecting the pituitary gland in childhood; some of these tumors (eg craniopharyngioma) are included among the most common central nervous system tumors in childhood. The gene(s) involved in the pathogenesis of these tumors are largely not known; their possible association with other developmental defects or inheritance pattern(s) has not been investigated. The present study serves as a (i) screening/training, and, (ii) a research protocol.

Continuation of this protocol will eventually lead to new, separate protocols that will address all aspects of diagnosis of pituitary tumors and their therapy in childhood.

As with the clinical studies, the present protocol may help generate ideas for future studies on the treatment and clinical follow up of pediatric patients with tumors of the pituitary gland and, thus, lead to the development of better therapeutic regimens for these neoplasms.", "detailed_description": "There are a variety of tumors affecting the pituitary gland; The gene(s) involved in the pathogenesis of these tumors are largely not known; their possible association with other developmental defects or inheritance pattern(s) has not been investigated.

The following criteria must be met for all, who enter the study: - Age 3-70 years - Evidence for the existence of a tumor of the hypothalamic-pituitary unit, as indicated by previously obtained imaging studies or biochemical investigation of the hypothalamo-hypophyseal function. Patients may withdraw from the study at any time. B. For family members studied for linkage analysis, the following criteria must be met: - Any age - Member of a kindred suspected of having an inherited form of pituitary neoplasia, as evidenced by results of a patient studied under A (above).", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "3 Years", "maximum_age": "70 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00001595.xml"}
