{"brief_title": "Combination Chemotherapy and Computer-Planned Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Unresectable Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Computer systems that allow doctors to create a 3-dimensional picture of the tumor to plan treatment may result in more effective radiation therapy. It is not yet known which chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy regimen is more effective in treating non-small cell lung cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of different combination chemotherapy regimens and 3-dimensional radiation therapy in treating patients who have unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Compare the overall response rate, failure-free survival, and survival of patients with inoperable stage IIIA or IIIB non-small cell lung cancer treated with paclitaxel and carboplatin with concurrent 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3-D XRT) vs gemcitabine and carboplatin with concurrent 3-D XRT. - Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients. - Compare the pattern of failure (locoregional vs distant failure) in patients treated with these regimens. - Determine the feasibility of delivering 3-D XRT to patients in this multicenter study. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses. Patients then receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour followed by carboplatin IV over 30 minutes once weekly and 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3-D XRT) once daily 5 days a week. Treatment repeats weekly for 7 courses. - Arm II: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 followed by carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses. Patients then receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes twice weekly and 3-D XRT as in arm I. Treatment repeats weekly for 7 courses. In both arms, treatment continues in the absence of disease progression. Patients are followed every 2 months for 2 years, every 4 months for 2 years, and then annually for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 82 patients (41 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 9 months.", "condition": "Lung Cancer", "intervention_type": "Radiation", "intervention_name": "radiation therapy", "description": "3-D XRT 7400 cGy total after induction (during cycles 3-9)", "arm_group_label": "Gemcitabine + Carboplatin", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically or cytologically confirmed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) - Squamous cell carcinoma - Adenocarcinoma, including bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma - Large cell anaplastic carcinoma, including giant and clear cell carcinoma - Inoperable stage IIIA or IIIB disease - No direct invasion of vertebral body - Tumors adjacent to a vertebral body without bone invasion allowed if all gross disease can be encompassed in radiotherapy boost field - Contralateral mediastinal disease (N3) allowed if all gross disease can be encompassed in radiotherapy boost field - No scalene, supraclavicular, or contralateral hilar node involvement - Transudate, cytologically negative, non-bloody pleural effusion allowed if it can be encompassed in radiotherapy field - No exudative, bloody, or cytologically malignant pleural effusion - Evidence of pleural effusion by chest CT scan but not chest x-ray that is too small to tap allowed - At least 1 unidimensionally measurable lesion - At least 20 mm by conventional techniques OR - At least 10 mm by spiral CT scan - The following are not considered measurable disease: - Bone lesions - Leptomeningeal disease - Ascites - Pleural/pericardial effusion - Abdominal masses that are not confirmed and followed by imaging techniques - Cystic lesions - Tumor lesions in a previously irradiated field PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 and over Performance status: - ECOG 0-1 Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - Granulocyte count at least 1,500/mm3 - Platelet count at least 100,000/mm3 Hepatic: - Bilirubin less than 1.5 mg/dL - AST less than 2 times upper limit of normal Renal: - Creatinine clearance 20-130 mL/min for females - Creatinine clearance 20-150 mL/min for males Pulmonary: - FEV1 at least 1.2 L Other: - Not pregnant or nursing - Fertile patients must use effective contraception - No other currently active malignancy (defined as completed prior therapy and considered to be at less than 30% risk of relapse) except non-melanoma skin cancer PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - Not specified Chemotherapy: - No prior chemotherapy for NSCLC - No other concurrent chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: - No concurrent hormonal therapy except steroids for adrenal failure or septic shock, hormones for non-disease-related conditions (e.g., insulin for diabetes), or glucocorticosteroids as antiemetics Radiotherapy: - See Disease Characteristics - No prior radiotherapy for NSCLC Surgery: - At least 2 weeks since prior exploratory thoracotomy", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00033553.xml"}
