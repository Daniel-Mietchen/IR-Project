{"brief_title": "Multicenter Study of Nontuberculous Mycobacteria in Cystic Fibrosis Patients", "brief_summary": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the prevalence of nontuberculous mycobacteria in sputum cultures from patients with cystic fibrosis. II. Compare the clinical course of patients with negative versus positive cultures.", "detailed_description": "PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Participants are screened for nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) with 3 sputum acid-fast bacilli smears and mycobacterial cultures, with speciation of positive cultures, collected over 1 year. Demographic data, diagnostic criteria, clinical measurements, and other respiratory pathogen data are collected using the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry Questionnaire. NTM-positive patients (cases) matched with NTM-negative controls identified in screening are followed every 3 months for 15 months. Cases are evaluated for NTM burden during the first 3 months. Appropriate therapy is offered to consistently NTM-positive cases. Lung transplant recipients are removed from study.", "condition": ["Cystic Fibrosis", "Atypical Mycobacterium Infection"], "criteria": "PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA: Patients over age 10 with cystic fibrosis documented as follows: - Pilocarpine sweat chloride test at least 60 mEq/L OR - Genotyping or transepithelial potential difference AND - Clinical symptoms of suppurative respiratory disease or pancreatic insufficiency Able to produce at least 3 sputum samples - Bronchoscopy specimens acceptable - Throat/nasal specimens not acceptable No Pseudomonas cepacia colonization", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "10 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "rare disease", "mesh_term": ["Infection", "Fibrosis", "Cystic Fibrosis", "Mycobacterium Infections", "Mycobacterium Infections, Nontuberculous"], "id": "NCT00004296"}
