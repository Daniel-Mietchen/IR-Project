{"brief_title": "Intravenous Compared With Intrahepatic Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Colorectal Cancer Metastatic to the Liver", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of intravenous infusion or intrahepatic infusion of fluorouracil and leucovorin in treating patients with colorectal cancer metastatic to the liver.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the survival and response rates of patients with colorectal liver metastases treated with intravenous vs. intrahepatic arterial infusion of fluorouracil/leucovorin. II. Assess the effect of these 2 treatments on symptoms and quality of life of these patients. OUTLINE: Randomized study. Patients randomized to Arm II should have a preoperative hepatic angiography; at laparotomy, an intrahepatic arterial catheter is fused into the gastroduodenal artery to establish an infusion of both lobes of the liver. Arm I: Single-Agent Chemotherapy with Drug Modulation. Fluorouracil, 5-FU, NSC-19893; with Leucovorin calcium, CF, NSC-3590. Intravenous infusion. Arm II: Single-Agent Chemotherapy with Drug Modulation. 5-FU; with CF. Intrahepatic arterial infusion. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 312 patients are expected to be randomized within 3-4 years.", "condition": ["Colorectal Cancer", "Metastatic Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["fluorouracil", "isolated perfusion", "leucovorin calcium"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum with metastases confined to the liver and not amenable to surgery PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: Any age Performance status: WHO 0-2 Life expectancy: More than 3 months Hematopoietic: WBC at least 3,000/mm3 Absolute neutrophil count at least 1,500/mm3 Platelet count at least 100,000/mm3 Hepatic: Bilirubin less than 3.5 mg/dL (50 micromoles/liter) Renal: Not specified Cardiovascular: No uncontrolled heart disease (e.g., congestive heart failure, angina) Other: No uncontrolled infection No other uncontrolled medical illness PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: No prior fluorouracil (5-FU) for advanced disease More than 6 months since adjuvant 5-FU (e.g., in AXIS or QUASAR studies)", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "liver metastases", "mesh_term": ["Colorectal Neoplasms", "Neoplasm Metastasis", "Fluorouracil", "Levoleucovorin"], "id": "NCT00002692"}
