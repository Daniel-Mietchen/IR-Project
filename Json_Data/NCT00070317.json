{"brief_title": "Lymph Node Mapping and Sentinel Lymph Node Identification in Patients With Stage IB1 Cervical Cancer", "brief_summary": "This clinical trial is studying how well lymph node mapping and sentinel lymph node identification work in finding lymph node metastases in patients with stage IB1 cervical cancer. Diagnostic procedures, such as lymph node mapping and sentinel lymph node identification, performed before and during surgery, may improve the ability to detect lymph node metastases in patients who have cervical cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the sensitivity of the sentinel lymph node in the determination of lymph node metastases, using preoperative or intraoperative lymphatic mapping, in patients with stage IB1 cervical cancer. II. Determine the false-negative predictive value of the sentinel lymph node in the determination of lymph node metastases in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive radiolabeled technetium Tc 99m sulfur colloid injected around the tumor 6 hours prior to or after induction of anesthesia right before surgery. Patients then undergo radical hysterectomy and complete pelvic and low para-aortic lymphadenectomy. Intraoperatively, patients undergo lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymph node identification using isosulfan blue or methylene blue injected at 4 locations in the cervix and a hand-held gamma counter.", "condition": ["Cervical Adenocarcinoma", "Cervical Adenosquamous Carcinoma", "Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma", "Stage I Cervical Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Procedure", "Procedure", "Drug", "Procedure", "Procedure", "Radiation", "Procedure"], "intervention_name": ["Isosulfan Blue", "Lymph Node Mapping", "Lymphangiography", "Methylene Blue", "Radionuclide Imaging", "Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy", "Technetium Tc-99m Sulfur Colloid", "Therapeutic Conventional Surgery"], "description": ["Undergo lymphangiography using isosulfan blue or methylene blue", "Undergo lymphatic mapping", "Undergo lymphangiography using isosulfan blue or methylene blue", "Undergo lymphangiography using isosulfan blue or methylene blue", "Undergo radionuclide imaging with technetium Tc 99m sulfur colloid", "Undergo complete pelvic and low para-aortic lymphadenectomy", "Undergo radionuclide imaging with technetium Tc 99m sulfur colloid", "Undergo radical hysterectomy"], "arm_group_label": ["Diagnostic", "Diagnostic", "Diagnostic", "Diagnostic", "Diagnostic", "Diagnostic", "Diagnostic", "Diagnostic"], "other_name": ["Lymphazurin", "N-[4-[(4-(diethylamino)phenyl)(2,5-disulfophenyl)methylene]-2,5-cyclohexadien-1-ylidene]-N-ethyl-ethanaminium hydroxide", "lymphatic mapping", "Lymphography", "Azul de Metileno", "Azul Metile", "Blu di Metilene", "CI Basic Blue 9", "CI-52015", "Collubleu", "Colour Index No. 52015", "Desmoidpillen", "Methylenum Caeruleum", "Methylthioninii Chloridum", "Methylthioninium Chloride", "Schultz No. 1038", "Tetramethylthionine Chloride Trihydrate", "Urolene Blue", "Vitableu", "nuclear medicine scan", "radioimaging", "Radionuclide Scanning", "Scan", "SCINTIGRAPHY", "Sentinel Node Biopsy", "Sentinel node biopsy alone", "SLNB", "SNB", "Tc 99m Sulfur Colloid", "Tc-99m SC", "Technetium Tc 99m Sulfur Colloid"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Diagnosis of carcinoma of the cervix of 1 of the following cellular types: - Squamous cell carcinoma - Adenocarcinoma - Adenosquamous cell carcinoma - Stage IB1 disease (no greater than 4 cm) - No unequivocal evidence of metastases - Adequate surgical candidate - No known allergy to triphenylmethane compounds - No prior pelvic irradiation - No prior retroperitoneal surgery - More than 4 weeks since prior cold knife or loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) cone biopsy - Prior cone biopsy allowed provided current disease is stage IB1", "gender": "Female", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "mesh_term": ["Carcinoma", "Carcinoma, Squamous Cell", "Adenocarcinoma", "Uterine Cervical Neoplasms", "Carcinoma, Adenosquamous", "Technetium Tc 99m Sulfur Colloid", "Methylene Blue"], "id": "NCT00070317"}
