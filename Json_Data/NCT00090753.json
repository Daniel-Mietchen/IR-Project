{"brief_title": "A Study of Intravenous or Subcutaneous Methoxy Polyethylene Glycol-Epoetin Beta (RO0503821, Mircera) in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients With Renal Anemia", "brief_summary": "This study assessed the long-term efficacy, safety, and tolerability of intravenous (iv) or subcutaneous (sc) methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta in chronic kidney disease patients with renal anemia. Eligible patients were those who were receiving stable maintenance therapy with methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta or erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) in Phase II or III clinical studies.
