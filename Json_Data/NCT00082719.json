{"brief_title": "Short-Term Low-Dose Interferon Alfa in Treating Patients With Cancer of the Urothelium", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of tumor cells and slow the growth of urothelial cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase I trial is studying how well low-dose interferon alfa works in treating patients with cancer of the urothelium.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the modulation of apoptosis-related pathways in patients with cancer of the urothelium treated with short-term low-dose interferon alfa. OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms. In all arms, treatment begins at the time of the pre-operative visit and continues until the time of cystoscopy. - Arm I: Patients receive low-dose interferon alfa subcutaneously (SC) twice daily. - Arm II: Patients receive interferon alfa as in arm I at a higher dose. - Arm III: Patients receive interferon alfa SC once daily. - Arm IV: Patients receive interferon alfa as in arm III at a higher dose. In all arms, treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": "Urethral Cancer", "intervention_type": "Biological", "intervention_name": "Recombinant Interferon Alfa", "description": "In all arms, treatment begins at pre-operative visit and continues until cystoscopy.\nArm I: Low-dose interferon alfa subcutaneously (SC) twice daily.
