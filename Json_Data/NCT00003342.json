{"brief_title": "Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Advanced Bladder or Kidney Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects of giving gemcitabine, doxorubicin, and paclitaxel together with carboplatin in treating patients with advanced bladder or kidney cancer and impaired kidney function.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety and toxicity of dose-dense carboplatin plus paclitaxel on a weekly schedule given in sequence after gemcitabine and doxorubicin in patients with renal impairment and metastatic or locally advanced transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium. - Observe the outcome of this sequential systemic chemotherapy in these patients, or following surgical resection as adjuvant therapy in patients in whom poor renal function precludes the use of cisplatin-based chemotherapy. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of carboplatin. Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 10 minutes and doxorubicin IV over 15 minutes for 5 doses on weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is given subcutaneously on days 3 through 10 of each 2-week course. On week 11, patients receive paclitaxel and carboplatin IV over 1 hour weekly for 12 weeks. Each cohort of 3 patients is entered on sequentially increasing doses of carboplatin. If any patient experiences dose limiting toxicity (DLT), then 6 patients are entered at that dose level. If 3 patients experience DLT at any dose level, the maximum tolerated dose has been surpassed and a total of 6 patients are treated at the previous level. Patients are evaluated at week 16 and at end of study. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 18-30 patients accrued into this study over 9-15 months.", "condition": ["Bladder Cancer", "Transitional Cell Cancer of the Renal Pelvis and Ureter"], "intervention_type": ["Biological", "Drug", "Drug", "Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["filgrastim", "carboplatin", "doxorubicin hydrochloride", "gemcitabine hydrochloride", "paclitaxel"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed advanced transitional cell urothelial cancer - Clinical Stage IV: T any, N1-3, M0; T any, N any, M1; or cT4, Nx, M0 (bladder tumors) - Pathological Stage III or IV bladder cancer: T any, N1-3, M0; T3b, N0, M0; T4, N0, M0; and T4, Nx, M0 - Pathological Stage III or IV urothelial cancer of the renal pelvis or ureter: T any, N1-3, M0; T3, N0, M0; T4, N0, M0; and surgery has been performed within 10 weeks of initiation of therapy - Impaired renal function (See Renal function tests) PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 and over Performance status: - Karnofsky 60-100% OR - ECOG 0-1 Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - Granulocyte count at least 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 150,000/mm^3 Hepatic: - Bilirubin less than 1.5 times normal - Alkaline phosphatase less than 2 times normal - SGOT less than 2 times normal Renal: - Creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL but no greater than 2.5 mg/dL OR - Creatinine clearance 30-59 mL/min Cardiovascular: - Normal cardiac function by history, physical examination, and chest radiograph OR - If prior cardiac disease, left ventricular ejection fraction must be at least 50% by radionuclide ventriculogram or echocardiogram - No serious cardiac arrhythmias; including first, second, and third degree heart block - No New York Heart Association class III or IV heart disease Other: - No uncontrolled infection - No other active cancer, except nonmelanomatous skin cancer and in situ carcinoma of the cervix curatively treated - Not pregnant - Effective barrier contraception required for all fertile patients during and for 6 months after therapy (encouraged to continue for 2 years or longer) PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - Not specified Chemotherapy: - No prior systemic chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: - Not specified Radiotherapy: - No prior radiotherapy to the bladder - At least 4 weeks since any other prior radiotherapy Surgery: - See Disease Characteristics", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "regional transitional cell cancer of the renal pelvis and ureter", "mesh_term": ["Urinary Bladder Neoplasms", "Carcinoma, Transitional Cell", "Kidney Neoplasms", "Ureteral Neoplasms", "Paclitaxel", "Gemcitabine", "Liposomal doxorubicin", "Albumin-Bound Paclitaxel", "Carboplatin", "Doxorubicin"], "id": "NCT00003342"}
