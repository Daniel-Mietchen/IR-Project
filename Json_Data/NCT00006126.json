{"brief_title": "Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation in Treating Patients With Melanoma or Small Cell Lung, Breast, Testicular, or Kidney Cancer That is Metastatic or That Cannot Be Treated With Surgery", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have melanoma or small cell lung, breast, testicular, or kidney cancer that is metastatic or that cannot be treated with surgery.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxicity of allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in patients with metastatic or unresectable small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, testicular germ cell cancer, melanoma, or renal cell cancer. II. Determine the efficacy of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Donors receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously for 4 or 5 days prior to peripheral blood stem cell harvest. Patients are assigned to one of three conditioning regimens, depending on disease. Group A (small cell lung cancer): Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours on days -7 and -6, etoposide IV over 4 hours on day -5, and total body irradiation twice daily on days -4 to -1. Group B (breast cancer and testicular germ cell cancer): Patients receive oral busulfan every 6 hours on days -7 to -4 for a total of 14 doses. Patients then receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours on days -3 and -2. Group C (renal cell cancer and melanoma): Patients receive fludarabine IV daily on days -8 to -4 and cyclophosphamide IV on days -3 and -2. All groups: Patients receive allogeneic peripheral blood stem cells IV over 10-20 minutes on day 0. Patients are followed weekly for 3 months, at 6 and 12 months, and then yearly for 5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-42 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": "Testicular Germ Cell Tumor", "intervention_type": "Radiation", "intervention_name": "radiation therapy", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed metastatic or unresectable solid tumor of one of the following types: Small cell lung cancer Extensive stage (disease outside the hemithorax) or relapsed Prior cytoreduction with platinum/etoposide regimen and/or taxane containing regimen Epithelial breast cancer Stage IV or relapsed disease Prior cytoreduction with adriamycin and/or taxane regimens Testicular germ cell cancer Failure to achieve complete remission with platinum based chemotherapy Relapsed disease with at least one salvage regimen Melanoma Metastatic disease that has failed at least one biologic response modifier such as interleukin-2 or interferon Relapsed disease involving a visceral organ Renal cell cancer Metastatic disease that has failed at least one biologic response modifier such as interleukin-2 or interferon Relapsed disease involving a visceral organ HLA matched or one antigen mismatched related donor available Hormone receptor status: Not specified PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: Under physiologic 60 Menopausal status: Not specified Performance status: ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy: Not specified Hematopoietic: Not specified Hepatic: Bilirubin no greater than 2.0 mg/dL unless due to Gilbert's disease SGOT no greater than 3 times upper limit of normal Renal: Creatinine no greater than 2.0 mg/dL Cardiovascular: No congestive heart failure LVEF at least 40% Pulmonary: DLCO at least 45% of predicted OR FEV1/FVC at least 50% of predicted Other: HIV negative Not pregnant or nursing Fertile patients must use effective contraception PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: See Disease Characteristics Chemotherapy: See Disease Characteristics Endocrine therapy: Not specified Radiotherapy: No prior radiotherapy that would preclude study Surgery: See Disease Characteristics", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "59 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00006126.xml"}
