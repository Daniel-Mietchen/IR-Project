{"brief_title": "S9926 Temozolomide in Patients With Unresectable/Metastatic Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of temozolomide in treating patients who have unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the complete and partial response (confirmed and unconfirmed) in patients with unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors treated with temozolomide. - Determine the qualitative or quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a confirmed complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses after a confirmed CR. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 13-27 months.", "condition": ["Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["temozolomide"], "description": ["200 mg/m^2/day, PO, on Days 1-5 of each 28 day cycle."], "arm_group_label": ["Temozolomide"], "other_name": ["NSC-362856"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically or cytologically confirmed unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) - Primary (gastrointestinal or intra-abdominal origin) tumor - At least 1 measurable lesion by x-ray, CT, MRI, ultrasound, or physical examination - If lesions within prior radiation port are used as target lesions for response assessment, those lesions must have demonstrated clear progression after completion of radiotherapy - No uterine or retroperitoneal sarcomas or non-intra-abdominal leiomyosarcomas PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - Not specified Performance status: - Zubrod 0-2 Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - WBC (white blood count) at least 3,000/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 100,000/mm^3 Hepatic: - Bilirubin no greater than 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) Renal: - Creatinine no greater than 1.5 times ULN Other: - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception - No medical or psychological conditions that would preclude study participation - No major infection requiring systemic antibiotics - No uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infection - No other prior malignancy within the past 5 years except: - Adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer - Adequately treated stage I or II cancer in complete remission - Carcinoma in situ of the cervix PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - At least 30 days since prior biologic therapy - Prior imatinib mesylate as adjuvant therapy or for metastatic disease allowed Chemotherapy: - No prior chemotherapy for GIST - At least 30 days since other prior chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: - Not specified Radiotherapy: - See Disease Characteristics - No prior radiotherapy for GIST - No concurrent radiotherapy for GIST - Concurrent palliative radiotherapy for painful metastases (encompassing a total portal of no greater than 5 x 5 cm) allowed Surgery: - See Disease Characteristics - At least 4 weeks since prior major surgery and recovered Other: - At least 30 days since prior investigational drugs", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "gastrointestinal stromal tumor", "mesh_term": ["Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors", "Temozolomide", "Dacarbazine"], "id": "NCT00005597"}
