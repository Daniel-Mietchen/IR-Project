{"brief_title": "Bone Marrow Transplantation in Treating Patients With Hematologic Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Bone marrow that has been treated to remove certain white blood cells may be able to replace immune cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy or radiation therapy, and may reduce the chance of developing graft-versus-host disease following bone marrow transplantation. PURPOSE: Phase IV trial to study the incidence of graft-versus-host disease in patients who have hematologic cancer and who are undergoing bone marrow transplantation from a donor.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the incidence of acute graft versus host disease in patients undergoing transplantation with an unrelated or related matched or mismatched antigen donor. II. Evaluate the rapidity of engraftment and CD4 count recovery post-transplantation in this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients receive total body irradiation (TBI) three or two times a day on days -8 to -5. Following TBI, patients receive thiotepa IV over 4 hours daily on days -4 and -3 plus cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour daily on days -2 and -1. Antithymocyte globulin is administered by IV over at least 4 hours on days -4 to -1. Patients undergo an allogenic bone marrow transplantation on day 0. Bone marrow is harvested from patient's donor, depleted of T-cells, and infused. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously beginning on day 4. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 26-45 patients will be accrued for this study within 3-4 years.", "condition": "Myelodysplastic Syndromes", "intervention_type": "Radiation", "intervention_name": "radiation therapy", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically proven malignancy or condition of the following types: Acute myelogenous leukemia (not M5 or M6) or lymphocytic leukemia in first or greater remission or early relapse OR Chronic myelogenous leukemia OR Myelodysplastic syndrome OR Aggressive or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma OR Aggressive or refractory Hodgkin's disease OR Multiple myeloma at early relapse or after conventional chemotherapy to reduce tumor mass OR High risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia OR Aplastic anemia HLA-matched or 1 antigen mismatched (related or unrelated) available as donor PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: 50 and under Performance status: Karnofsky 70-100% Life expectancy: Greater than 8 weeks Hematopoietic: Not specified Hepatic: Bilirubin less than 2 mg/dL SGOT less than 4 times upper limit of normal (ULN) Renal: Creatinine less than 2 times ULN OR Creatinine clearance greater than 60 mL/min Cardiovascular: LVEF at least 50% by MUGA Pulmonary: DLCO at least 50% Other: HIV negative No active extramedullary disease Not pregnant or nursing Negative pregnancy test Fertile patients must use effective contraception PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: See Disease Characteristics", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "50 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00003398.xml"}
