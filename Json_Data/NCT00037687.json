{"brief_title": "Safety and Efficacy of Recombinant Human Platelet-Activating Factor Acetylhydrolase for the Treatment of Severe Sepsis", "brief_summary": "The objective of this study is to demonstrate that rPAF-AH is safe and reduces 28 day all cause mortality in patients with severe sepsis.", "detailed_description": "This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of rPAF-AH compared to placebo in patients with severe sepsis. Eligible patients from investigative sites located throughout the United States and other countries will be randomized to receive either rPAF-AH or placebo administered daily for five consecutive days by intravenous (IV) infusion. All patients will be evaluated for safety and efficacy endpoints over 28 days. A follow-up evaluation will occur approximately 6 months after Day 28 to assess functional status and quality of life.", "condition": ["Sepsis"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["rPAF-AH"], "criteria": "Inclusion criteria - Clinical diagnosis of severe sepsis - At least 18 years old - Patient or legally authorized representative able to provide informed consent Exclusion criteria - Severe lung injury (acute respiratory distress syndrome) - Immunocompromised - Severe liver disease - Inflammation of the pancreas, organ rejection, or burns to more than 30% of body - Enrolled in another clinical trial - Already participated in this or other rPAF-AH study - There is not a commitment to aggressive treatment - Has a disease with life expectancy less than 6 months", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "Platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase", "mesh_term": ["Sepsis", "Toxemia"], "id": "NCT00037687"}
