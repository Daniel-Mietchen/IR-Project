{"brief_title": "Functional Brain Imaging - Acupuncture and Osteoarthritis", "brief_summary": "The goal of this study is to use single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (f-MRI) of the brain to study the response of both normal participants and participants with Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee to acupuncture.", "detailed_description": "Recent experimental studies in both animal and humans have begun to demonstrate some measurable physiologic effects that are associated with acupuncture, suggesting the possibility of a neurophysiologic explanation. In addition, brain research continues to uncover a complex set of endogenous neurologic control systems, such that it has become clear that the brain plays a major role in the modulation of pain perception and control. If acupuncture can be demonstrated to have a consistent effect on specific areas of the brain, it will become possible to explore the potential efficacy of acupuncture based on measurable neurophysiologic responses.", "condition": "Osteoarthritis", "intervention_type": "Procedure", "intervention_name": "acupuncture", "arm_group_label": "A", "criteria": "Inclusion criteria: - Seen in an outpatient clinical setting - Have active knee OA of >6 months including Kellgren x-ray changes >2 from an x-ray report <12 months old or new x-ray interpretation - Moderate unilateral only pain (average >4/10 on a 0-10 likert scale) for more than 5 out of 7 days - Have the capacity to understand the requirements of the study and complete the baseline studies in a reasonable time frame, as determined by the interviewer Exclusion criteria: - Having had acupuncture before (must be acupuncture na\u00efve) - Any history of claustrophobia that could affect the subject's ability to tolerate the f-MRI study - Hip or ankle disease by history or exam severe enough to cause pain >2/10 daily - Bleeding disorder or current use of warfarin or heparin by patient history - Other primary causes of chronic knee pain, per the referring physician, including chondromalacia patella, torn meniscus or ligament injury.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "40 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "Accepts Healthy Volunteers", "id": "NCT00070824.xml"}
