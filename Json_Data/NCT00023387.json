{"brief_title": "TBTC Study 25PK: Intensive Pharmacokinetic Study of Three Doses of Rifapentine and 25-Desacetyl Rifapentine", "brief_summary": "Primary objective: To compare the pharmacokinetics of rifapentine and 25-desacetyl rifapentine at three different doses: 600 mg, 900 mg, and 1200 mg. Secondary objective: To describe any correlation between pharmacokinetic parameters of three different doses of rifapentine plus a standard dose of isoniazid and the occurrence of toxicity attributed to anti-tuberculosis treatment.", "detailed_description": "We will enroll 24-36 patients, 8-12 at each dose of 600, 900 and 1200 mg rifapentine Admissions for pharmacokinetic studies will take place during the continuation phase of tuberculosis therapy. Patients participating in a double-blinded trial of the tolerability and safety of higher doses of rifapentine during continuation phase therapy and consenting to participate in the pharmacokinetic study may be admitted to a Clinical Research Center (CRC) to allow for frequent blood sampling over a 24-hour period. Otherwise, patients will be evaluated in the clinic.", "condition": ["Tuberculosis"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Rifapentine", "25-desacetyl Rifapentine", "Isoniazid"], "criteria": "Inclusion: Patients enrolled in TBTC Study 25 Informed consent Exclusion: Severe anemia (Hct <25%) Any severe adverse event related to study drugs in TBTC Study 25", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "mesh_term": ["Tuberculosis", "Isoniazid", "Rifapentine", "Rifampin"], "id": "NCT00023387"}
