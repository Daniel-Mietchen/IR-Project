{"brief_title": "Randomized Safety, Tolerability and Pilot Efficacy of AN-1792 in Alzheimer's Disease", "brief_summary": "A multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled out-patient, safety, tolerability, and pilot efficacy study of intramuscular AN-1792 in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.", "detailed_description": "The study will enroll approximately 375 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease at investigational sites in the United States and Europe. Patients will receive either AN-1792 or placebo, and they will be evaluated using standard clinical assessments of cognition and memory as well as experimental surrogate markers of Alzheimer's disease pathology. The goal of the study is to evaluate the clinical impact of eliciting an immune response (formation of antibodies) to the A-beta peptide in patients with Alzheimer's disease.", "condition": ["Alzheimer's Disease"], "intervention_type": ["Biological"], "intervention_name": ["AN-1792 also known as AIP-001"], "criteria": "Mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.
