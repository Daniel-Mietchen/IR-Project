{"brief_title": "Combination of Capecitabine and GTI-2040 in the Treatment of Renal Cell Carcinoma", "brief_summary": "This phase II, 43 patient trial, will evaluate the efficacy of GTI-2040, an antisense oligonucleotide complementary to the R2 component of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) mRNA, in combination with capecitabine, in the setting of advanced/metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Preclinical studies have shown synergy between GTI-2040 and capecitabine against renal cell carcinoma.", "condition": "Metastases, Neoplasm", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "GTI-2040", "criteria": "- Age greater than or equal to 18. - Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma for which no effective therapy is available or that is unresponsive to conventional therapy. - Measurable disease. To be considered measurable, a lesion must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as greater than or equal to 20 mm with conventional techniques or as greater than or equal to 10 mm with spiral CT scan. - Karnofsky performance status of greater than or equal to 70. - Be able to have a central venous like access maintained throughout the study. - Provide written informed consent prior to the initiation of protocol therapy. - Appropriate organ function.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00056173.xml"}
