{"brief_title": "Oxaliplatin and Capecitabine in Treating Patients With Advanced Esophageal Cancer or Stomach Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining oxaliplatin with capecitabine in treating patients who have advanced esophageal cancer or stomach cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the objective tumor response rate of patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, gastroesophageal junction, or gastric cardia treated with oxaliplatin and capecitabine. Secondary - Determine the time to progression and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. - Assess the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses after CR. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then every 3 weeks (prior to each course of chemotherapy). Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years.", "condition": ["Esophageal Cancer", "Gastric Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["capecitabine", "oxaliplatin"], "arm_group_label": ["oxaliplatin + capecitabine", "oxaliplatin + capecitabine"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, gastroesophageal junction, or gastric cardia for which no potentially curative or significant palliative therapy exists - Unresectable disease - Gastric cardia is defined as no more than 5 cm from the gastroesophageal junction into the stomach - Measurable disease - No known CNS metastases PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 and over Performance status: - ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy: - At least 12 weeks Hematopoietic: - Absolute neutrophil count at least 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 100,000/mm^3 Hepatic: - Bilirubin no greater than upper limit of normal (ULN) - AST no greater than 3 times ULN - Alkaline phosphatase no greater than 2 times ULN Renal: - Creatinine no greater than 1.5 times ULN - Creatinine clearance at least 60 mL/min Cardiovascular: - No New York Heart Association class III or IV heart disease Other: - Able to swallow capecitabine - No unresolved gastrointestinal bleeding - No uncontrolled infection - No chronic debilitating disease - No peripheral neuropathy grade 2 or greater - No other malignancy within the past 5 years except adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer or adequately treated noninvasive carcinoma - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - No prior immunotherapy or biological therapy for recurrent or metastatic disease - No concurrent biologic agents Chemotherapy: - No prior chemotherapy for recurrent or metastatic disease - Prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy (including combination chemotherapy and radiotherapy) allowed - No other concurrent chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: - Not specified Radiotherapy: - See Chemotherapy - No prior radiotherapy for recurrent or metastatic disease - No prior radiotherapy to more than 25% of the bone marrow - Prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant radiotherapy allowed - More than 4 weeks since prior radiotherapy - No concurrent radiotherapy Surgery: - More than 4 weeks since prior abdominal exploration with surgical resection - More than 3 weeks since prior abdominal exploration without surgical resection Other: - No concurrent oral cryotherapy during oxaliplatin administration", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "adenocarcinoma of the esophagus", "mesh_term": ["Adenocarcinoma", "Stomach Neoplasms", "Esophageal Neoplasms", "Capecitabine", "Oxaliplatin"], "id": "NCT00040859"}
