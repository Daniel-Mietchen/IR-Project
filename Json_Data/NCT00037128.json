{"brief_title": "Study of GL701 in Men With Systemic Lupus Erythematosus", "brief_summary": "Lupus flares and other symptoms associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) may be caused by a deficiency of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). GL701 is an investigational new drug meant to enhance DHEA levels. This study is designed to evaluate both the safety and efficacy of GL701 in male lupus patients.", "condition": ["Systemic Lupus Erythematosus"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["GL701"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria - Patient must have a diagnosis of SLE > 6 months according to the 1989 revised ACR criteria.
