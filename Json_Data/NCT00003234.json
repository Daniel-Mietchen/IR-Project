{"brief_title": "Vinorelbine in Treating Children With Recurrent or Refractory Cancers", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of vinorelbine in treating children with recurrent or refractory cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate of children with recurrent or refractory malignancies treated with vinorelbine. II. Assess the toxic effects of this drug in these children. OUTLINE: Patients receive vinorelbine IV over 6-10 minutes weekly on weeks 1-6. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for a total of 10 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 4 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 100 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.", "condition": ["Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors", "Neuroblastoma", "Sarcoma"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["vinorelbine tartrate"], "arm_group_label": ["Stratum 1 - Soft Tissue Sarcoma", "Stratum 2 - CNS Tumors", "Stratum 3 - Neuroblastoma"], "other_name": ["Navelbine\u00ae", "3',4'-didehydro-4'-deoxy-C'-norvincaleukoblastine [R-(R*,R*)-2,3,-dihydroxybutanedioate)"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed recurrent or refractory solid malignant tumors of childhood including: Soft tissue sarcoma Rhabdomyosarcoma Nonrhabdomyosarcoma Extraosseous Ewing's sarcoma CNS tumors Astrocytoma Primitive neuroectodermal tumor Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors Ependymoma Recurrent neuroblastoma Measurable disease No more than 2 prior treatment regimens PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: 21 and under at diagnosis Performance status: ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy: At least 2 months Hematopoietic: For patients with solid tumors (unless marrow involvement): Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at least 1000/mm3 Platelet count at least 100,000/mm3 (transfusion independent) Hemoglobin at least 10 g/dL (RBC transfusions allowed) For patients post bone marrow transplantation: ANC at least 1,000/mm3 Platelet count at least 50,000/mm3 (transfusion independent) Hemoglobin at least 10 g/dL (RBC transfusions allowed) Hepatic: Total bilirubin no greater than 1.5 times normal SGOT/SGPT less than 2.5 times normal Renal: Creatinine no greater than 1.5 times normal OR Creatinine clearance or radioisotope glomerular filtration rate at least 70 mL/min Neurologic: Seizure disorder allowed if well controlled CNS toxicity no greater than grade 2 PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: At least 6 months since prior bone marrow transplantation No concurrent immunomodulating agents Chemotherapy: At least 2 weeks since prior chemotherapy (4 weeks for nitrosourea) and recovered No other concurrent chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: No concurrent corticosteroids except for increased intracranial pressure due to CNS tumors Radiotherapy: At least 6 months since prior radiotherapy to craniospinal axis, spine, and/or more than 50% of the bony pelvis Concurrent radiotherapy to localized painful lesions allowed if at least one measurable lesion is not in radiation field Surgery: Not specified Other: No concurrent participation in another CCG, POG, or COG therapeutic study", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "21 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "recurrent childhood ependymoma", "mesh_term": ["Sarcoma", "Neuroblastoma", "Nervous System Neoplasms", "Central Nervous System Neoplasms", "Vinorelbine", "Vinblastine"], "id": "NCT00003234"}
