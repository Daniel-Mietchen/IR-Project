{"brief_title": "A Study of E7389 in Advanced/Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to determine if E7389 is a safe and effective treatment for advanced/metastatic breast cancer.", "detailed_description": "The primary objective is to determine the response rate (RR) to E7389 monotherapy administered as an IV bolus of 1.4 mg/m^2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-Day cycle and on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle in patients with advanced/metastatic breast cancer treated with chemotherapy including an anthracycline and a taxane, with previously documented progression during or within six months following the last dose of prior chemotherapy. The secondary objectives are to evaluate: - The safety and tolerability of E7389 monotherapy in this patient population; - The antitumor activity of E7389 as determined by duration of response, time to progression, and overall survival; - Quality of life measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) questionnaire/tumor-related symptom improvement or worsening measured by pain intensity on a visual analog scale (VAS), analgesics consumption, weight changes and performance status (PS); - Tumor pharmacogenetics and their possible relationship to response (assessment of beta-tubulin isotype mRNA on biopsy sample) in patients who have signed a separate consent form", "condition": "Breast Neoplasms", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "E7389", "description": "The first cohort of subjects were to receive E7389 1.4 mg/m^2 as an intravenous (IV) bolus on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle.

If a single lesion is identified as the target lesion, a cytological or histological confirmation of breast carcinoma is required. - Patients must have had prior treatment with an anthracycline and a taxane (either sequential or in combination) and may have had prior treatment with other agents as well. - Patients must have progressed within six months of the last dose of chemotherapy, or experienced disease progression while receiving chemotherapy for advanced/metastatic disease. - Resolution of all chemotherapy or radiation-related toxicities to less than grade 1 severity - Age \u2265 18 years - Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (APPENDIX 4) of 0 or 1 - Life expectancy of \u2265 3 months - Adequate renal function as evidenced by serum creatinine \u2264 1.5 mg/dL or calculated creatinine clearance \u2265 50 mL/minute (min) per the Cockcroft and Gault formula - Adequate bone marrow function as evidenced by absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 1.5 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin \u2265 10.0 g/dL (a hemoglobin <10.0 g/dL would be acceptable if it can be corrected by growth factor or transfusion), and platelet count \u2265 100 x 10^9/L - Adequate liver function as evidenced by bilirubin \u2264 1.5 mg/dL and alkaline phosphatase, alanine transaminase (ALT), and aspartate transaminase (AST) \u2264 3 times the upper limits of normal (ULN) (in the case of liver metastases \u2264 5 x ULN) - Patients willing and able to complete the FACT-B questionnaire, Analgesic Diary, Pain VAS, and the tumor-related symptomatic assessment - Patients willing and able to comply with the study protocol for the duration of the study - A sample from the diagnostic biopsy (paraffin block) must be available - Written informed consent prior to any study-specific screening procedures with the understanding that the patient may withdraw consent at any time without prejudice Exclusion Criteria: - Patients who have received chemotherapy, radiation, hormonal therapy, or Herceptin within 2 weeks of E7389 treatment start - Radiation therapy encompassing > 10% of marrow - Failure to recover from any chemotherapy related or other therapy related toxicity at study entry that is deemed to be clinically significant by the study investigator - Prior treatment with Mitomycin C or nitrosoureas - Prior high dose chemotherapy with hematopoietic stem cell rescue in the past two years - Pulmonary lymphangitic involvement that results in pulmonary dysfunction requiring active treatment, including the use of oxygen - Active symptomatic brain metastasis; Patients with central Nervous System (CNS) metastasis are considered eligible if they have completed local therapy and discontinued from corticosteroids for at least two weeks before starting treatment with E7389 - Patients with meningeal carcinomatosis - Patients who require therapeutic anti-coagulant therapy with Warfarin or related compounds; Mini dose warfarin for catheter related thrombosis prophylaxis is permitted - Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding; Women of childbearing potential with either a positive pregnancy test at Screening or no pregnancy test. Women of childbearing potential unless (1) surgically sterile or (2) using adequate measures of contraception in the opinion of the Investigator.
