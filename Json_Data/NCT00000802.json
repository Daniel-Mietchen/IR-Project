{"brief_title": "A Randomized, Comparative Study of Daily Dapsone and Daily Atovaquone for Prophylaxis Against PCP in HIV-Infected Patients Who Are Intolerant of Trimethoprim and/or Sulfonamides", "brief_summary": "To compare the efficacy and safety of dapsone versus atovaquone in preventing or delaying the onset of histologically proven or probable Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in HIV-infected patients with CD4 counts <= 200 cells/mm3 or <= 15 percent of the total lymphocyte count who are intolerant to trimethoprim and/or sulfonamides. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), which is effective for secondary PCP prophylaxis, is associated with allergic manifestations and side effects that limit its use. Patients who are intolerant of TMP/SMX require an effective alternative. Dapsone and atovaquone have both shown promise as PCP prophylactic agents.", "detailed_description": "Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), which is effective for secondary PCP prophylaxis, is associated with allergic manifestations and side effects that limit its use.

NOTE: - Pregnant patients are eligible at the clinician's discretion. Prior Medication: Allowed: - Prior PCP prophylaxis. Exclusion Criteria Co-existing Condition: Patients with the following symptoms or conditions are excluded: - Active pneumocystosis. Concurrent Medication: Excluded: - PCP prophylaxis (other than study drug) or any medication with potential anti-PCP activity. Patients with the following prior conditions are excluded: - Known treatment-limiting reaction to dapsone or atovaquone.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "13 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "atovaquone", "mesh_term": ["HIV Infections", "Pneumonia", "Pneumonia, Pneumocystis", "Dapsone", "Trimethoprim", "Atovaquone"], "id": "NCT00000802"}
