{"brief_title": "Effects of Subanesthetic Concentrations of Isoflurane/Nitrous Oxide - 3", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to conduct experiments to examine subjective and reinforcing effects of nitrous oxide. Mood altering and psychomotor effects will be tested on non-drug abusers and preference procedures will be used to assess reinforcing effects. To evaluate the acute and residual effects of subanesthetic concentrations of isoflurane/nitrous oxide combinations in healthy volunteers.", "condition": ["Opioid-Related Disorders", "Substance-Related Disorders"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Drug", "Other"], "intervention_name": ["30% N2O", "0.2% isoflurane", "0.4% isoflurane", "100% oxygen"], "arm_group_label": ["30% N2O", "0.2% isoflurane + 30% N2O", "0.4% isoflurane + 30% N2O", "0.2% isoflurane", "0.2% isoflurane + 30% N2O", "0.4% isoflurane", "0.4% isoflurane + 30% N2O", "Placebo"], "description": ["Placebo"], "criteria": "Please contact site for information.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "21 Years", "maximum_age": "32 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "Accepts Healthy Volunteers", "keyword": "drug interaction", "mesh_term": ["Disease", "Opioid-Related Disorders", "Substance-Related Disorders", "Nitrous Oxide", "Isoflurane"], "id": "NCT00000251"}
