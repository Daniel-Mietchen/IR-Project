{"brief_title": "Liposomal Lurtotecan in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Locally Recurrent Head and Neck Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of liposomal lurtotecan in treating patients who have metastatic or locally recurrent head and neck cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the therapeutic activity of lurtotecan liposome in patients with metastatic or loco-regionally recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. - Determine the objective response, duration of response, and time to progression in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients. - Determine the possible pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to presence of a target lesion in a previously irradiated field (within vs outside). Patients receive lurtotecan liposome IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 38-72 patients (19-36 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.", "condition": "Head and Neck Cancer", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "liposomal lurtotecan", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck - Metastatic or loco-regionally recurrent disease - No undifferentiated or non-keratinizing carcinomas including lymphoepitheliomas - No tumors of the nasal or paranasal cavities or of the nasopharynx - Measurable disease - No clinical symptomatic evidence of brain or leptomeningeal metastases - Ineligible for loco-regional treatment after chemotherapy PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 and over Performance status: - ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - Neutrophil count at least 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 100,000/mm^3 Hepatic: - Bilirubin less than 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) - Transaminases no greater than 2.5 times ULN (5 times ULN if liver metastases present) Renal: - Creatinine no greater than 1.5 times ULN - No uncontrolled hypercalcemia Other: - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception during and for 30 days after study - No known hypersensitivity to systemic liposomal formulations or compounds chemically related to study drug - No uncontrolled systemic disease or infection - No psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical condition that would preclude study - No other prior or concurrent malignancy except adequately treated cone-biopsied carcinoma in situ of the cervix or basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - No concurrent anticancer biological therapy or immune response modifiers - No concurrent prophylactic hematopoietic growth factors Chemotherapy: - See Disease Characteristics - No prior chemotherapy for recurrent disease - No prior therapy with camptothecin analogues - At least 8 weeks since prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy - No other concurrent anticancer cytotoxic therapy Endocrine therapy: - Not specified Radiotherapy: - At least 8 weeks since prior radiotherapy and recovered Surgery: - Not specified Other: - At least 30 days since prior experimental drug", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00022594.xml"}
