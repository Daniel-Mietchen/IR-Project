We will compare a control group to two different voucher-based contingent-reinforcement procedures: one that targets smoking abstinence alone vs. one that offers additional incentives for negative BAL and urinalysis results.", "condition": ["Tobacco Use Disorder"], "intervention_type": ["Behavioral"], "intervention_name": ["Behavior Therapy"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Pregnant and or post-partum with at least one child under 1 year old living with them, or non-pregnant, non-post-partum females or previous participant in this study protocol - Nicotine Dependent as confirmed by DSM-IV checklist - Current cigarette smoker - Breath CO reading of at least 8 ppm at the time of the initial study screening - Current client with the Shields for Families (Shields) treatment programs Exclusion Criteria: - Non-smoker", "gender": "Female", "minimum_age": "15 Years", "maximum_age": "99 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "Accepts Healthy Volunteers", "keyword": "nicotine dependence", "mesh_term": ["Tobacco Use Disorder"], "id": "NCT00064922"}
