{"brief_title": "A Randomized, Phase I/II Trial to Assess the Safety and Antiviral Effects of Escalating Doses of A Human Anti-Cytomegalovirus Monoclonal Antibody (SDZ MSL-109) in Patients With the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome and CMV Viremia and/or Viruria", "brief_summary": "To determine the safety, tolerance, and potential in vivo antiviral effects of five dosage levels and a dose to be determined of human anti-cytomegalovirus (CMV) monoclonal antibody (SDZ MSL-109; formerly SDZ 89-109) when administered once every 2 weeks for a total of 12 doses to patients with either AIDS or eligible AIDS-related complex (ARC) and with culture proven evidence of CMV viremia and/or viruria. Sandoglobulin will be employed as a comparative control.", "condition": ["Cytomegalovirus Infections", "HIV Infections"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Sevirumab"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria Concurrent Medication: Allowed: - Zidovudine (AZT). - Acyclovir. - Experimental maintenance or prophylactic therapy with an approved therapeutic agent for a non-viral opportunistic infection. - Trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole (TMP / SMX). - Pyrimethamine / sulfadoxine. - Inhaled pentamidine. - Amphotericin B. - Ketoconazole. - Flucytosine (5-FC). - Antituberculosis therapy. - Recombinant human erythropoietin. - Recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). - Recombinant human interferon alfa 2 for AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma. Patients must have: - AIDS or be HIV positive with CD4 lymphocyte counts below 200 cells/mm3 and be receiving prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) (with or without prophylaxis for another opportunistic infection), but have no prior medical history of an opportunistic infection. - Expected survival of = or > 6 months. - Willingness and ability to give written informed consent. - A copy of the signed and witnessed consent form must be maintained with the investigator's study files. - Positive culture results documenting the presence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia and/or viruria. - Seropositive for the presence of circulating anti-CMV immunoglobulin. Exclusion Criteria Co-existing Condition: Patients with the following conditions or symptoms are excluded: - Significant pulmonary dysfunction. - Uncontrolled or unstable diabetes. - Significant cardiovascular disease including uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, angina pectoris, or a history of myocardial infarction within one year of entry into the study. - Coagulation or hemorrhagic disorders. - Any active severe opportunistic infection. Concurrent Medication: Excluded: - Therapy with ganciclovir (DHPG) or phosphonoformate (PFA) or other experimental anti-cytomegalovirus therapy except as stipulated in this protocol. - Any other experimental antiviral therapy. - Biologicals including immunoglobulin therapy (except those patients randomized to receive Sandoglobulin as specified in this protocol). Patients with the following are excluded: - Any significant organ system dysfunction as described in Exclusion co-existing conditions. - Previous history of or evidence of idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, agammaglobulinemia, or hypogammaglobulinemia. - Any other severe concomitant clinical condition. - Documented, active cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease (tissue or organ invasion/dysfunction) at baseline. To this end, baseline indirect funduscopy (to detect and exclude patients with peripheral CMV retinitis) will be performed. Prior Medication: Excluded within 2 weeks of study entry: - Therapy with ganciclovir (DHPG) or phosphonoformate (PFA) or other experimental anti-cytomegalovirus therapy except as stipulated in this protocol. - Any other experimental antiviral therapy. - Biologicals including immunoglobulin therapy (except those patients randomized to receive Sandoglobulin as specified in this protocol). - Excluded: - Prior treatment with monoclonal antibodies derived from any animal species. Prior Treatment: Excluded within 2 weeks of study entry: - Major surgery.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "Antibodies, Monoclonal", "mesh_term": ["Infection", "Communicable Diseases", "HIV Infections", "Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes", "Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome", "Cytomegalovirus Infections", "Viremia", "Antibodies", "Immunoglobulins", "Antibodies, Monoclonal", "Antiviral Agents"], "id": "NCT00002268"}
