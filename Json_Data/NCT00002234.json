During the study, patients are evaluated for changes from baseline in plasma HIV-1 RNA and lymphocyte subsets and for the development of adverse experiences and laboratory toxicities. At Weeks 8, 12, 24, and 48, patients are assessed for adherence to study treatment with a questionnaire. Patients who experience virologic failure are discontinued from the study. Patients who experience treatment intolerance may have their antiretroviral treatment regimens changed. After Week 48, patients with documented virologic response are eligible to continue receiving study treatment.", "condition": ["HIV Infections"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Efavirenz", "Adefovir dipivoxil", "Lamivudine", "Didanosine"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria You may be eligible for this study if you: - Are HIV-positive. - Are at least 13 years old (need consent of parent or guardian if under 18). - Have an HIV count of 5,000 copies/ml or more within 30 days prior to study entry. - Have a CD4+ count of 50 cells/mm3 or more.
