{"brief_title": "Cell Selection for Bone Marrow Transplants to Prevent Graft-Versus-Host-Disease", "brief_summary": "Blood contains different kinds of cells, white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. In order to treat certain diseases, specific cell types can be removed from blood and transplanted into patients. The process of removing white blood cells for the treatment of leukemia is called apheresis. This study will make available blood cell collections from volunteers genetically matched to various degrees with recipients in order to test and, if necessary, refine the process of removing white blood cell T-lymphocytes.", "detailed_description": "This protocol has been written to make available apheresis collections from volunteers matched to various degrees with recipients in order to test and, if necessary refine, the selective immunodepletion procedure prior to introducing it in a clinical trial.", "condition": ["Graft vs Host Disease", "Hematologic Neoplasm"], "criteria": "- INCLUSION CRITERIA: Family members of patients admitted to NHLBI allogeneic BMT protocols. Ages 18 and older and less than age 65. Parent of patient (obligate haplotype match) OR HLA 3/6, 4/6, 5/6, or 6/6 match with patient. Research apheresis available from patient. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Pregnancy or lactation. HLA type unknown. More than one haplotype mismatch with patient. History of any immunosuppressive disease. History of chronic viral antigenic stimulus.
