{"brief_title": "Study of the Neurobiology of Tourette Syndrome and Related Disorders", "brief_summary": "OBJECTIVES: I. Investigate the pathobiology of Tourette syndrome and related disorders by measuring various compounds of interest in cerebrospinal fluid, plasma, and urine of patients with Tourette syndrome, obsessive compulsive disorder, and/or chronic tics. II. Determine the pattern of familial aggregation of Tourette syndrome and obsessive compulsive disorder by systematic assessment of all first-degree family members of patients selected for cerebrospinal fluid studies. III. Establish the neurochemical and neuropeptide profile associated with the range of expression of the putative Tourette gene expression in adult and adolescent patients.", "detailed_description": "PROTOCOL OUTLINE: All patients are screened with a complete physical and neurologic exam, and a semi-structured interview. Patients then receive a comprehensive assessment of systemic disease. Patients and first-degree family members also participate in a genetic study. Any patient who experiences an unusual exacerbation of symptoms or significant side effects is removed from the study.", "condition": "Obsessive Compulsive Disorder", "criteria": "PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA: --Disease Characteristics-- Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV lifetime diagnosis of 1 or more of the following: - Tourette syndrome (TS) - Obsessive compulsive disorder - Chronic tics Severely affected adolescents with a score of 3 or greater on the TS-Clinical Global Impression Scale eligible --Prior/Concurrent Therapy-- At least 1 month since any medication --Patient Characteristics-- Other: - In good physical health - No alcohol or substance abuse - No Intelligence Quotient below 80 - Negative pregnancy test required of fertile women", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "12 Years", "maximum_age": "45 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00004325.xml"}
