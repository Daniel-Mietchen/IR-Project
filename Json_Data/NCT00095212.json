{"brief_title": "Androgen Effects in HIV-infected Women", "brief_summary": "Androgen deficiency in HIV-infected women is associated with sarcopenia and may cause critical reductions in physical functioning and reduced bone density. The effects of long-term androgen therapy on lean body mass, bone density and other clinical endpoints including quality of life, functional status and neurocognitive function in HIV-infected women are not known.", "detailed_description": "We will perform an 18-month randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study among relatively androgen deficient women with HIV, to determine the effects of testosterone administration on lean body mass. The administered dose will be 300 micrograms twice a week vs. identical placebo in the form of a transdermal preparation. Secondary endpoints include effects on bone density, quality of life, neurocognitive function and menstrual function. Open label administration at 300 micrograms twice a week will be initiated for 12 months in all subjects following the randomized portion of the study. Assuming a 15% dropout rate and 25 randomized patients, the probability is 80 percent that the study will detect a treatment difference at a two sided 5.000 percent significance level, if the true difference between the treatments is 2.7 kg. This is based on the assumption that the standard deviation of the response variable, lean body mass by DEXA, is 2.3 kg, as was shown by Choi et al1 over 12 weeks in HIV-infected women at the same dose of 300 ug 2x/week.", "condition": ["HIV Infection"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["1 Transdermal Testosterone (Patch)", "2 Placebo Patch"], "description": ["300 micrograms twice a week", "Placebo patch (0 micrograms of testosterone) applied twice a week"], "arm_group_label": ["1 Transdermal Testosterone (Patch)", "2 Placebo Patch (identical in appearance)"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Female 18 - 55 - BMI less than or equal to 26 - HIV-infected - Androgen deficient, with free testosterone < 3 pg/mL - Stable antiretroviral regimen for 3 months prior to study - Tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or verbalized understanding of appropriate barrier contraception methods.
