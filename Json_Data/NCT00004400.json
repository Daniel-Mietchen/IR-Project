{"brief_title": "Phase II Randomized Study of Physiologic Testosterone Replacement in Premenopausal, HIV-Positive Women", "brief_summary": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether physiologic testosterone replacement can increase fat-free mass, therefore contributing to weight maintenance, improved muscle function, and quality of life in HIV-infected women. II. Examine the mechanism of testosterone-induced increase in fat-free mass.", "detailed_description": "PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study. Patients are randomized to one of three arms. Arm I: Patients receive two placebo transdermal patches applied twice a week (every 3-4 days). Arm II: Patients receive one testosterone transdermal patch and one placebo transdermal patch applied twice a week (every 3-4 days). Arm III: Patients receive two testosterone transdermal patches applied twice a week (every 3-4 days). Patients receive 12 weeks of treatment in the absence of adverse reaction or health deterioration. Patients are followed on day 1, every 2 weeks during treatment, and at the end of the recovery period. Quality of life is assessed before treatment begins and at weeks 6 and 12.
