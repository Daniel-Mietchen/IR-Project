{"brief_title": "Treating Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis With Pioglitazone", "brief_summary": "Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a common liver disease that resembles alcoholic hepatitis but occurs in persons who drink little or no alcohol. The etiology of NASH is unclear, but it is commonly associated with diabetes, obesity, and insulin resistance. Several pilot studies, including a study of pioglitazone at the NIH Clinical Center (01-DK-0130), have shown that the insulin-sensitizing thiazolidinediones lead to decreases in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and improved liver histology. Once therapy is stopped, however, ALT levels rapidly return to pre-treatment values. Inaddition we are currently enrolling patients with NASH in a pilot study of metformin therapy for 48-weeks, however our results in 3 patients thus far have not been very encouraging. In the current study, patients who have completed the pilot study of pioglitazone and have been off therapy for 48 weeks will be offered re-treatment for 3 years. We also propose to treat patients who have not had a satisfactory response to metformin with pioglitazone for the same duration. After a repeat medical and metabolic evaluation and liver biopsy, patients with moderate-to-severe NASH (activity score greater than or equal to 4) will restart pioglitazone at a dose of 15 mg daily. If after 48 weeks, ALT levels are not normal or improved to the degree identified during the pilot study, the dose will be increased to 30 mg daily at the end of 3 years, all patients will undergo repeat medical and metabolic evaluation and liver biopsy. The primary end point will be improvement in liver histology. Secondary end points will be improvements in insulin sensitivity, reduction in visceral fat, liver volume, and liver biochemistry. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether long-term pioglitazone therapy can safely achieve and maintain biochemical and histological improvements in NASH.", "detailed_description": "Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a common liver disease that resembles alcoholic hepatitis but occurs in persons who drink little or no alcohol.

At least 48 weeks of follow up on no thiazolidinedione therapy after completion of protocol 01-DK-0130. At least 24-weeks follow up on no metformin theray after completion of protocol 03-DK-0233. Written informed consent. Patients who participated in protocol 01-DK-0130 will also have to meet the following inclusion criteria: Demonstrated improvements in liver histology and/or serum ALT levels during the 48-week course of pioglitazone therapy in protocol 01-DK-0130. Elevations in serum ALT levels. Liver biopsy showing NASH with a total NASH activity score of at least 4 (of a total possible score of 16) including a score of at least 1 each for parenchyma inflammation, cellular injury and steatosis on liver biopsy taken 48 weeks after stopping pioglitazone. Willingness to receive pioglitazone for 3 years. Patients who participated in protocol 03-DK-0233 will also have to me the following inclusion criteria: Demonstrated no significant improvement in liver histology and/or serum ALT levels during the 48-week course of metformin treatment in protocol 03-DK-0233. Elevations in serum ALT levels. Liver biopsy showing NASH with a total activity score of at least 4 (of a total possible score of 16) including a score of at least 1 each for parenchymal inflammation, cellular injury and steatosis on liver biopsy taken at the end of the 48-week course of metofrmin. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Evidence of another form of liver disease (these largely will have been excluded based upon enrollment in the previous study, 01-DK-0130 and 03-DK-0233). Hepatitis B as defined as presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Hepatitis C as defined by presence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA in serum.
