{"brief_title": "Safety and Efficacy of Pletal (Cilostazol) for the Treatment of Juvenile Primary and Secondary Raynaud\u2019s Phenomenon", "brief_summary": "Juvenile secondary Raynaud\u2019s (ray-knows) Phenomenon is a disorder of the blood vessels in the fingers and sometimes can affect the toes, nose, or ears. Children with secondary Raynaud\u2019s Phenomenon have an underlying condition such as systemic lupus, scleroderma, or mixed connective tissue disease. When children with secondary Raynaud\u2019s are exposed to chilly or cold conditions from weather, cold temperatures, or even holding cold items from the refrigerator, their fingers may become cold, numb, hurt, and/or turn purple or white. The investigational drug, Pletal(cilostazol), which has been approved for other conditions, inhibits the ability of one type of blood cell, platelets, to form blood clots, and also widens narrowed blood vessels. It has been used in a variety of other conditions in which blood flow is decreased. This study will test the safety and effectiveness Pletal(cilostazol) to lessen the severity of the symptoms and decrease the number of secondary Raynaud\u2019s episodes in juvenile patients.", "condition": "Raynaud's Disease", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Pletal", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria - 5 to 16 years old - fulfill diagnostic criteria for primary or secondary Raynaud's", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "5 Years", "maximum_age": "16 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00048776.xml"}
