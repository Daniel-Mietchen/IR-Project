{"brief_title": "Long-Term Effects of Treatment in Patients Previously Treated for Childhood Hodgkin's Lymphoma", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Assessing the long-term effects of cancer treatment in cancer survivors may help improve the ability to plan effective treatment and follow-up care. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the long-term effects of treatment in patients who were previously treated for childhood Hodgkin's lymphoma.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the cumulative incidence and characterize the spectrum of selected adverse physiologic and psychosocial outcomes, using self-report and clinical evaluation, in patients previously treated for childhood Hodgkin's lymphoma. - Compare the cumulative incidence and spectrum of self-reported adverse outcomes of these patients, using data collected at a comparable time period after diagnosis, with Hodgkin's lymphoma survivors from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS). - Compare self-reported health-related outcomes with outcomes detected by clinical evaluation and medical record review of each group of patients. OUTLINE: This is a cohort, cross-sectional, multicenter study. - Contemporary group: Patients complete a self-report of long-term outcomes questionnaire and a comprehensive psychosocial questionnaire. A medical record review is then performed. Patients then undergo a comprehensive risk-based clinical evaluation with specific examinations and studies based upon the Children's Oncology Group Late Effects Screening Guidelines and the patients' specific therapeutic exposures. - Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) group: Patients undergo a telephone interview and have medical records reviewed to validate select self-reported long-term outcomes. Patient replies from the baseline CCSS questionnaire (which was completed at certain timepoints after diagnosis) are reviewed for targeted long-term outcomes. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 1,000 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": "Lymphoma", "intervention_type": "Procedure", "intervention_name": "management of therapy complications", "arm_group_label": "All patients", "study_pop": "\n      ", "sampling_method": "Non-Probability Sample", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Contemporary cohort - At least 5 years since diagnosis of Hodgkin's lymphoma - Diagnosed between the years 1987-2001 - 21 and under at diagnosis - No evidence of disease - Prior treatment on 1 of the following protocols during the years 1987-2001: - Children's Cancer Group (CCG) CCG-5942, CCG-59704 - Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) POG-8625, POG-8725, POG-9425, POG-9426 - Pediatric Hodgkin's Consortium: VAMP, VEPA, VAMP/COP - Institutional protocols COPP/ABV, MOPP/ABVD, ABVD - Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) Hodgkin's lymphoma cohort - Current enrollment in the CCSS - Diagnosed between the years 1976-1986 - Completed baseline questionnaire at comparable timepoints (as the contemporary cohort) after diagnosis PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - Any age Performance status - Not specified Life expectancy - Not specified Hematopoietic - Not specified Hepatic - Not specified Renal - Not specified PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - Not specified Chemotherapy - Not specified Endocrine therapy - Not specified Radiotherapy - Not specified Surgery - Not specified", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00091091.xml"}
