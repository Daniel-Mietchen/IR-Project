{"brief_title": "Phase I Study of Continuous Infusion Schedule of FMdC in Hematologic Malignancies", "brief_summary": "The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest dose of Tezacitabine (FMdC) which can be safely given as a continuous infusion by vein to patients with hematologic malignancies. The general safety and effectiveness of this drug will also be studied.", "detailed_description": "Patients with leukemias that have relapsed from previous therapies have a low cure rate. Hence the need to discover new antileukemic agents. Tezacitabine is a nucleoside analogue with equivalent or even superior activity when compared with ara-C in leukemic cell lines. It has shown significant antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo tumor models. Several phase I studies with various dosing schedules have been conducted in solid tumors where the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is mainly myelosuppression, usually a favorable feature for development of leukemia. In a phase I study in hematological malignancies, we used Tezacitabine as a bolus infusion daily x 5. The DLT consisted of grade 3 CNS toxicities and mucositis in 3/6 patients. The study is ongoing and we are currently evaluating a dose level of 7.5 mg/m2 as possible Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD). However, in view of the fact that tezacitabine is a cell cycle specific agent with a short terminal plasma half-life of 2 to 6 hours, a continuous infusion dosing schedule may enhance the activity and reduce the incidence of adverse effects of tezacitabine.", "condition": ["Hematologic Malignancies"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Tezacitabine (FMdC)"], "description": ["7.5 mg/m2 bolus infusion daily x 5"], "arm_group_label": ["Tezacitabine"], "other_name": ["FMdC", "(E)-2'-Deoxy-2'-(Fluoromethylene) Cytidine"], "criteria": "- Patient with relapsed/refractory acute leukemias (AML, ALL, high-grade myelodysplastic syndromes, CMML in transformation with >/= 10% peripheral blood/bone marrow blasts, CML in blast crisis), or patients with relapsed/refractory CLL and an absolute neutrophil count of >/= 1,000/ml and platelet count of >/= 75,000/ml. - Signed informed consent indicating that patients are aware of the investigational nature of this study, and in keeping with the policies of this hospital.
