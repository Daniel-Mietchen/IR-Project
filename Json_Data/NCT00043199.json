{"brief_title": "A Safety and Effectiveness Study of Aroplatin in Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer Resistant to Standard Therapies", "brief_summary": "To determine the rate of response and duration of reponse following therapy with Aroplatin in subjects with advanced colorectal cancer resistant to standard therapies. Secondary objectives are to determine safety and tolerability of the Aroplatin therapy.", "detailed_description": "Primary Objective: - To determine response rate (RR; complete and partial response[CR,PR] and duration after therapy with Aroplatin (Liposomal NDDP, L-NDDP) in subjects with locally recurrent, unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer refractory to 5-FU/leucovorin or capecitabine, and irinotecan. Secondary Objective: - To determine safety and tolerability of the Aroplatin therapy. This is a single-arm, open-label phase II study. Subjects refractory to 5-FU/leucovorin or capecitabine, and irinotecan therapies will be enrolled. Dosing will be every four weeks with individual dose escalations and adjustments for toxicity.", "condition": "Colorectal Neoplasms", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Aroplatin (Liposomal NDDP, L-NDDP)", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Colorectal cancer, locally recurrent, unresectable or metastatic disease (AJCC); - Measurable disease (RECIST criteria); - Cancer refractory to 5-FU/leucovorin or capecitabine, and irinotecan; - ECOG performance score of 0-2; - Adequate hematopoietic, liver and renal function; - Adequate cardiac function (maximum of class II, NYHA); - Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test; - Signed written informed consent; - Subjects must be willing to to be followed during the course of treatment/observation and follow-up.
