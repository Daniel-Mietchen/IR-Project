{"brief_title": "Topotecan and Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Cancer of the Cervix", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of topotecan and paclitaxel in treating patients who have recurrent or metastatic cancer of the cervix.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response, time to progression, disease free survival, and overall survival of patients with recurrent and/or metastatic cancer of the cervix treated with a combination of topotecan and paclitaxel. - Determine the feasibility and toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1 and topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered on days 6-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days for a minimum of 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.", "condition": ["Cervical Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Biological", "Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["filgrastim", "paclitaxel", "topotecan hydrochloride"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed recurrent, persistent or metastatic cervical carcinoma (squamous or adenocarcinoma), with no potentially curative standard treatment - Measurable disease or evaluable disease PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 to physiological 60 Performance status: - ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy: - Greater than 2 months Hematopoietic: - WBC greater than 3000/mm3 - Platelet count greater than 100,000/mm3 Hepatic: - Bilirubin less than 1.5 times normal - SGOT/SGPT less than 1.5 times normal Renal: - BUN less than 1.5 times normal - Creatinine less than 1.5 times normal - Creatinine clearance greater than 50 mL/min Other: - Ineligible for other high priority national or institutional study - Not pregnant or nursing - HIV negative - No prior malignancy except nonmelanoma skin cancer - No serious medical or psychiatric illness preventing treatment or informed consent PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - Not specified Chemotherapy: - Greater than 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy - No greater than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens - No prior taxane or camptothecin Endocrine therapy: - No concurrent hormonal therapy except that required for nondisease related conditions (e.g., insulin for diabetes) Radiotherapy: - Greater than 4 weeks since prior radiation therapy - No concurrent radiation therapy Surgery: - Greater than 4 weeks since prior surgery", "gender": "Female", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "60 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "cervical adenocarcinoma", "mesh_term": ["Uterine Cervical Neoplasms", "Neoplasm Metastasis", "Paclitaxel", "Albumin-Bound Paclitaxel", "Topotecan"], "id": "NCT00003065"}
