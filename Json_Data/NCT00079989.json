{"brief_title": "Study Evaluating Tigecycline in Selected Serious Infections Due to Resistant Gram-Negative Organisms", "brief_summary": "To evaluate the safety and efficacy of tigecycline in the treatment of subjects with selected serious infections caused by resistant gram-negative bacteria, eg, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter species, Klebsiella pneumoniae or other resistant gram-negative pathogens, for whom antibiotics have failed or who cannot tolerate other appropriate antimicrobial therapies. The primary efficacy endpoint will be the clinical response.", "condition": "Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "tigecycline", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Male or female subjects aged 18 years or older - Isolation of a resistant gram-negative pathogen, eg, Enterobacter species, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or other resistant gram-negative pathogens, alone or as 1 isolate of a polymicrobial infection - Resistant gram-negative organisms are defined by the likely presence of ESBL or related mechanisms which limit the therapeutic alternatives for the treatment of complicated infections Exclusion Criteria: - Subjects with any concomitant condition or taking any concomitant medication that, in the opinion of the investigator, could preclude an evaluation of a response or make it unlikely that the contemplated course of therapy or follow-up assessment will be completed or that will substantially increase the risk associated with the subject's participation in this study - Anticipated length of antibiotic therapy < 7 days - Known or suspected hypersensitivity to tigecycline or other compounds related to this class of antibacterial agents (eg, tetracyclines, minocycline, doxycycline)", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00079989.xml"}
