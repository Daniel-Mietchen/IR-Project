{"brief_title": "Irinotecan and Docetaxel With or Without Cetuximab in Treating Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies such as cetuximab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Combining chemotherapy with cetuximab may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying giving irinotecan and docetaxel together with cetuximab to see how well it works compared to irinotecan and docetaxel alone in treating patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer .", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of irinotecan and docetaxel with or without cetuximab, in terms of objective response rate, in patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. - Determine the time to progression and overall survival of patients treated with these regimens. - Determine the proportion of patients with tumors that overexpress epidermal growth factor receptor. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm A: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour and irinotecan IV over 30 minutes weekly on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. - Arm B: Patients receive docetaxel and irinotecan as in arm A. Patients also receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36. Courses repeat in both arms every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 1 year, and then periodically thereafter.
