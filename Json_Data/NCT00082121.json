{"brief_title": "Safety and Efficacy of TP10, a Complement Inhibitor, in Adult Women Undergoing Cardiopulmonary Bypass Surgery", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to determine if the study drug (TP10), which blocks complement release, can reduce such side effects of complement inflammation as chest pain or heart attacks and be taken safely in women who undergo cardiopulmonary bypass surgery.", "detailed_description": "During cardiac surgery, a substance called \u201ccomplement\u201d is released by the body. This complement causes inflammation, which can lead to side effects such as chest pain, heart attacks, or heart failure. The purpose of this study is to determine if the study drug (TP10), which blocks complement release, can reduce such side events and be taken safely in women.", "condition": ["Myocardial Ischemia", "Coronary Arteriosclerosis", "Aortic Valve Insufficiency", "Mitral Valve Insufficiency"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["TP10"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Female - To undergo high-risk cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass pump (CPB) - CABG alone or with valve surgery Exclusion Criteria: - Acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) within a 3 days of entering the study - Conditions that may interfere with interpretation of electrocardiogram data - History of immune deficiency syndrome - Planned supplemental cardiac surgery or other surgery - Pregnancy or lactation", "gender": "Female", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "complement activation", "mesh_term": ["Ischemia", "Myocardial Ischemia", "Coronary Artery Disease", "Arteriosclerosis", "Aortic Valve Insufficiency", "Mitral Valve Insufficiency", "Complement System Proteins"], "id": "NCT00082121"}
