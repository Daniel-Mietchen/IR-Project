{"brief_title": "Chemotherapy Decisions and Outcomes in Older Women With Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Studying how older women make treatment decisions and how these decisions affect the outcome of treatment may help doctors plan more effective treatments and improve patient quality of life. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how a patient's treatment preferences and decisions about chemotherapy affect the outcome of treatment in older women with newly diagnosed breast cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the relationship between preferences and chemotherapy decisions in women age 65 and over with operable, newly diagnosed breast cancer. - Determine how factors that could be targets for intervention affect the relationship between preferences and chemotherapy decisions in these patients. - Determine the relationships between preference-based chemotherapy decisions, quality of life, and satisfaction with treatment decisions in these patients. - Determine the disease-free survival and competing causes of mortality of these patients. - Determine the types of physician providers who care for older breast cancer survivors after initial cancer treatment is completed and explore how women decide about which physicians to see. - Measure quality indicators for the survivorship phase of care and evaluate if quality varies by type of physician provider model. - Determine if long-term patient-reported satisfaction varies as a function of physician model for providing follow-up care post-treatment. - Determine whether physician-patient communication and coordination of care after treatment ends mediate follow-up quality and outcomes post-treatment. OUTLINE: This is a cohort study. Patients participate in interviews over 30-45 minutes at baseline, at 6 months, and at 1 and 2 years. Patients are followed annually for at least 5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,296 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24 months.", "condition": ["Breast Cancer", "Psychosocial Effects of Cancer and Its Treatment"], "intervention_type": ["Procedure", "Procedure"], "intervention_name": ["psychosocial assessment and care", "quality-of-life assessment"], "arm_group_label": ["Group 1", "Group 1"], "study_pop": "\n      ", "sampling_method": "Non-Probability Sample", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed primary adenocarcinoma of the breast - Operable disease - Invasive and unilateral tumor - No more than 20 weeks since diagnosis - T1-4 (tumor size \u2265 1 cm), N0, M0 OR - T1-4, N1-3, M0 - No prior carcinoma in situ, lobular carcinoma in situ, ductal carcinoma in situ, or invasive breast cancer - Hormone receptor status: - Any estrogen receptor status PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - 65 and over Sex - Female Other - No other malignancy except those for which the patient has completed treatment AND is considered to be at less than 30% risk of recurrence - History of non-melanoma skin cancer allowed - Sufficient cognitive function to consent to and complete interviews - English or Spanish speaking", "gender": "Female", "minimum_age": "65 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer", "mesh_term": ["Breast Neoplasms", "Estrogens"], "id": "NCT00068328"}
