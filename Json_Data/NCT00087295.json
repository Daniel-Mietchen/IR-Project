{"brief_title": "S0400, FR901228 in Treating Patients With Advanced Cancer of the Urothelium", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as FR901228 (depsipeptide), work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well FR901228 works in treating patients with advanced cancer of the urothelium that has progressed or recurred after receiving one chemotherapy regimen.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response (confirmed complete and partial) in patients with advanced transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium that has progressed after prior chemotherapy when treated with FR901228 (depsipeptide) . - Determine progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this drug. - Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this drug in these patients. - Determine, preliminarily, the effects of this drug on reversing tumor promoter gene methylation in these patients. - Correlate, preliminarily, tumor DNA in plasma with response or outcome in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive FR901228 (depsipeptide) IV over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete response receive 2 additional courses of treatment. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Bladder Cancer", "Transitional Cell Cancer of the Renal Pelvis and Ureter", "Urethral Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Depsipeptide"], "description": ["Depsipeptide wil be given 13 mg/m^2 through an intravenous (IV) over 4 hours on day 1, 8, and 15 for every 28 days (1 cycle = 28 days) until progression.
