{"brief_title": "Measurement of Outcome of Surgical Treatment in Patients With Acromegaly", "brief_summary": "OBJECTIVES: I. Compare growth hormone (GH) levels at baseline and after glucose suppression measured with both a polyclonal radioimmunoassay and a highly sensitive immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) in patients with acromegaly and normal volunteers. II. Measure the levels of IGF-I and its binding protein, IGFBP-3, in these cohorts. III. Determine any correlation between levels of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 and GH suppressibility as assessed by sensitive IRMA. IV. Determine if patients who demonstrate biochemical features of mild GH excess are at risk for progression to active disease.", "detailed_description": "PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Blood samples are collected and assessed for growth hormone and IGF-I by polyclonal radioimmunoassay (RIA) and immunoradiometric assay (IRMA). Growth hormone is measured at baseline and 60, 90, and 120 minutes after a 100 g glucose drink. Serum glucose is measured at baseline and at 2 hours post dextrose administration by the glucose hexokinase method. Clinical scores are determined for headache, perspiration, fatigue, joint pain, and acne. Exams and tests may be repeated every 6 months for 2 years.", "condition": "Acromegaly", "criteria": "PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA: --Disease Characteristics-- Diagnosis of acromegaly and treated with transsphenoidal surgery Biochemically and histologically confirmed growth hormone secreting tumor OR Healthy volunteers --Prior/Concurrent Therapy-- Surgery: - See Disease Characteristics - Greater than 6 months since prior surgery Other: At least 1 month since prior bromocriptine or octreotide --Patient Characteristics-- Performance status: Ambulatory Hepatic: No active hepatic disease Renal: No active renal disease Other: - No diabetes mellitus - No glucose intolerance - Hypopituitarism allowed if on stable doses of replacement therapy", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "20 Years", "maximum_age": "75 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "Accepts Healthy Volunteers", "id": "NCT00005100.xml"}
