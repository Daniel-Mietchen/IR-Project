{"brief_title": "Evaluation of Patients With Thyroid Disorders", "brief_summary": "Participants in this study will be patients diagnosed with or suspected to have a thyroid function disorder. These conditions may include: hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, thyroid hormone resistance, Graves' Dermopathy, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) secreting pituitary adenomas. The main purpose of this study is to further understand the natural history, clinical presentation, and genetics of thyroid function disorders. Many of the tests performed are in the context of standard medical care that is offered to all patients with thyroid function disorders. In addition, blood and tissue samples may be taken for research and genetic studies....", "detailed_description": "Patients with thyroid function abnormalities (hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism) are studied and treated in this protocol. A limited number of patients with a personal history of signs, symptoms or laboratory studies consistent with thyroid dysfunction or a strong family history of thyroid abnormalities are also enrolled. Patients undergo routine history and physical examination, standard endocrine blood and urine tests, a standard TRH test, thyroid nuclear medicine scan, thyroidal radioiodine (RAI) or technetium (99mTc) uptake measurements, as well as X-ray, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies or other standard diagnostic procedures, as clinically indicated. Patients will be screened for entry into other research studies.", "condition": "Hypothyroidism", "criteria": "- INCLUSION CRITERIA: Patients of any age with known or suspected thyroid abnormalities may be included in this study. These disorders can be broadly defined as hyper- or hypothyroid states and laboratory abnormalities.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00001159.xml"}
