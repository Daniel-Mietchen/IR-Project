{"brief_title": "Preoperative Thalidomide With Radiation Therapy For Patients With Low-Grade Primary Soft Tissue Sarcoma or Thalidomide With Radiation Therapy and Chemotherapy For Patients With High-Grade or Intermediate-Grade Primary Soft Tissue Sarcoma of the Arm, Leg, or Body Wall", "brief_summary": "Thalidomide may stop the growth of soft tissue sarcoma by stopping blood flow to the tumor. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and dacarbazine, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving thalidomide together with radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy before surgery may shrink the tumor so that it can be removed. This phase II trial is studying how well giving preoperative (before surgery) thalidomide together with radiation therapy works in treating patients with low-grade primary soft tissue sarcoma, and how well giving thalidomide together with radiation therapy, doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and dacarbazine works in treating patients with high-grade or intermediate-grade primary soft tissue sarcoma of the arm, leg, chest wall, or abdominal wall.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the treatment delivery and toxicity of the combination of thalidomide and radiotherapy in patients with low-grade primary soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity or body wall. II. Determine the treatment delivery and toxicity of the combination of thalidomide and doxorubicin, ifosfamide, dacarbazine, and radiotherapy in patients with high- or intermediate-grade primary soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity or body wall and compare these results with those of patients treated on RTOG-9514. III. Determine the feasibility of using specific tissue and circulating biomarkers of antiangiogenic response in patients treated with these regimens, in a multi-institutional setting. IV. Determine the quantitative changes and patient variabilities of these biomarkers before, during, and after therapy with these regimens. V. Determine the baseline data sets of biomarkers, particularly circulating endothelial cells, in patients treated with these regimens. VI. Determine the tolerance to long-term post-operative thalidomide in these patients. VII. Determine the clinical response to pre-operative therapy in these patients. VIII. Correlate local control and disease-free survival with surrogate biological endpoints in patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a pilot, cohort study. Patients with high- or intermediate-grade tumors >= 8 cm in diameter are assigned to cohort A and patients with low-grade tumors > 5 cm in diameter are assigned to cohort B. Cohort A: Patients receive doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and dacarbazine IV continuously on days 1-3, 22-24, and 43-45. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously beginning on days 4, 25, and 46 and continuing until blood counts recover. Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily on days 7-11, 14-18, 21, 28-32, 35-39, and 42. Patients receive oral thalidomide once daily on days 7-21 and 26-42. Patients undergo surgical resection between days 84 and 98. Beginning 2 weeks after surgery, patients receive oral thalidomide once daily for 12 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Cohort B: Patients receive oral thalidomide once daily beginning on day 1 and continuing until 1 week before surgery. Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, on weeks 1-5. Patients undergo surgical resection between days 77 and 91. Beginning 2 weeks after surgery, patients receive oral thalidomide once daily for 6 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 4 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 44 patients (22 per cohort) will be accrued for this study within 17 months.", "condition": ["Recurrent Adult Soft Tissue Sarcoma", "Stage I Adult Soft Tissue Sarcoma", "Stage II Adult Soft Tissue Sarcoma", "Stage III Adult Soft Tissue Sarcoma"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Drug", "Biological", "Radiation", "Drug", "Procedure", "Other"], "intervention_name": ["doxorubicin hydrochloride", "ifosfamide", "dacarbazine", "filgrastim", "radiation therapy", "thalidomide", "therapeutic conventional surgery", "laboratory biomarker analysis"], "description": ["Given IV", "Given IV", "Given IV", "Given subcutaneously", "Undergo radiotherapy", "Given orally", "Undergo surgical resection", "Correlative studies"], "arm_group_label": ["Cohort A (chemotherapy, radiation, thalidomide, surgery)", "Cohort A (chemotherapy, radiation, thalidomide, surgery)", "Cohort A (chemotherapy, radiation, thalidomide, surgery)", "Cohort A (chemotherapy, radiation, thalidomide, surgery)", "Cohort A (chemotherapy, radiation, thalidomide, surgery)", "Cohort B (thalidomide, radiation, surgery)", "Cohort A (chemotherapy, radiation, thalidomide, surgery)", "Cohort B (thalidomide, radiation, surgery)", "Cohort A (chemotherapy, radiation, thalidomide, surgery)", "Cohort B (thalidomide, radiation, surgery)", "Cohort A (chemotherapy, radiation, thalidomide, surgery)", "Cohort B (thalidomide, radiation, surgery)"], "other_name": ["ADM", "ADR", "Adria", "Adriamycin PFS", "Adriamycin RDF", "Cyfos", "Holoxan", "IFF", "IFX", "IPP", "DIC", "DTIC", "DTIC-Dome", "G-CSF", "Neupogen", "irradiation", "radiotherapy", "therapy, radiation", "Kevadon", "Synovir", "THAL", "Thalomid"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: -
