{"brief_title": "Clinical Trial of HuMax-CD4, a New Drug to Treat Early Stage T-Cell Lymphoma in the Skin.", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this trial is to determine the effect of HuMax-CD4 as a treatment for early stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Almost all patients who are affected by CTCL have cancerous cells which bear a receptor called CD4. HuMax-CD4 is an investigational drug directed against this receptor. There is no placebo in this trial; all patients will be treated with HuMax-CD4. During the trial, the response rates, duration of responses, relief of symptoms, and safety profile of HuMax-CD4 will be evaluated.", "condition": "Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "HuMax-CD4", "arm_group_label": "280 mg and 560 mg", "criteria": "Inclusion criteria - Medical diagnosis of CTCL, and positivity for the CD4 receptor. - Early stage CTCL - Have received at least two prior therapies with inadequate effect, including phototherapy and/or electron beam, and/or chemotherapy. - Male or female, age 18 or older. - Signed informed consent.
