{"brief_title": "Study of Aprepitant (MK-0869) for Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV) in Adolescent Participants (MK-0869-097)", "brief_summary": "This study is being conducted to demonstrate that aprepitant (MK-0869) prevents nausea and vomiting caused by emetogenic cancer chemotherapy in adolescent participants. Participants treated with emetogenic cancer chemotherapies that include either cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, or carboplatin, or participants who experienced nausea and/or vomiting when treated with a previously administered chemotherapy regimen that is planned to be repeated will be enrolled in this study. In the double-blind Part 1 of this study, enrolled participants will be randomized to receive either aprepitant or standard therapy. In Part 2 of this study, enrolled participants will receive open-label aprepitant.", "detailed_description": "The duration of treatment is the first 4 days of one 28-day cycle (Cycle 1). Participants who successfully complete Cycle 1 may be eligible to participate for 9 subsequent optional, open-label, 28-day cycles.", "condition": "Vomiting", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "rescue medication", "description": "Participants are allowed to take rescue medication throughout for nausea or vomiting. At the discretion of the investigator, participants are provided with a prescription for rescue medications.
