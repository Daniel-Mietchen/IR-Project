{"brief_title": "Electrophysiologic Measures of Treatment Response in Alzheimer Disease", "brief_summary": "The main purpose of this study is to determine the electrophysiological effects of cholinergic therapy (cholinesterase inhibitors and transdermal nicotine) in Alzheimer disease.

Subjects must either be planning to start daily cholinesterase therapy (e.g. Aricept, Exelon) or willing to try a transdermal nicotine patch for two 8 hour periods.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "55 Years", "maximum_age": "85 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "Accepts Healthy Volunteers", "id": "NCT00018278.xml"}
