{"brief_title": "The Safety of Zidovudine Plus Interferon-Alpha in HIV-Infected Children", "brief_summary": "PRIMARY: To determine the maximum tolerated dose of interferon-alfa (IFN-A) alone and in combination with zidovudine (AZT); to assess the safety and tolerance of IFN-A alone and in combination with AZT. SECONDARY: To evaluate the effect of combination IFN-A and AZT on immunologic and virologic parameters; to determine whether the pharmacokinetic parameters of AZT are modified by the subcutaneous administration of IFN-A. AZT is effective in suppressing the progression of HIV infection in patients without symptoms or with AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC). However, use of AZT is limited by its frequent toxicity, which sometimes relates to the amount of drug given. Thus, a combination treatment of two drugs that work together may provide more effective and safer treatment. IFN-A is a drug that has antiviral effects and may work well with AZT.", "detailed_description": "AZT is effective in suppressing the progression of HIV infection in patients without symptoms or with AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC). However, use of AZT is limited by its frequent toxicity, which sometimes relates to the amount of drug given. Thus, a combination treatment of two drugs that work together may provide more effective and safer treatment. IFN-A is a drug that has antiviral effects and may work well with AZT. The study is being conducted in three stages. In Cohort A (IFN-A alone), four patients receive IFN-A; subsequent four-patient cohorts receive doses escalated in increments. If 50 percent or more of patients at any dose level experience grade 2 or better toxicity, doses in subsequent cohorts are escalated. If grade 3 or 4 toxicity is seen in one patient at a given dose level, two additional patients are enrolled at that level. Treatment is given subcutaneously (under the skin, with a needle), 3 times per week for 12 weeks. The MTD is defined as the dose level immediately below that at which 50 percent or more of patients experience grade 3 or 4 toxicity. In Cohort B (combination IFN-A plus AZT), patients who complete treatment in Cohort A continue on the same dose of IFN-A, and a low, middle, or high dose of AZT is added. In Cohort C, four newly assigned patients who have been on a stable prescribed dose of AZT of at least 90 mg/m2 for 6 weeks are treated at each of the same dose combinations as those in Cohort B. Treatment is given for 12 weeks. IFN-A is given subcutaneously 3 times a week and AZT is given orally every 6 hours. Dose levels of both drugs are increased until 50 percent or more of patients experience grade 3 or 4 toxicity in any dose level.", "condition": ["HIV Infections"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Interferon alfa-2a", "Zidovudine"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria Concurrent Medication: Recommended: - Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.
