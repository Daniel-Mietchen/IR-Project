{"brief_title": "Perifosine in Treating Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of perifosine in treating patients who have locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of perifosine, in terms of 6-month survival, in patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. - Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients. - Determine median survival time and the 1-year survival rate of patients treated with this drug. - Determine the objective response rate (partial and complete), response duration, and time to progression in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral perifosine daily for 3 weeks. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 17-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 15 months.", "condition": ["Pancreatic Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["perifosine"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the pancreas not amenable to curative local therapy - Metastatic OR locally advanced - No known brain metastases - No ascites that required therapeutic paracentesis on at least 2 occasions within the past 6 weeks PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - 18 and over Performance status - ECOG 0-2 OR - Karnofsky 60-100% Life expectancy - Not specified Hematopoietic - WBC at least 3,000/mm^3 - Absolute neutrophil count at least 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 100,000/mm^3 Hepatic - Bilirubin no greater than 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) - AST/ALT no greater than 2.5 times ULN (5 times ULN with liver metastases) Renal - Creatinine normal OR - Creatinine clearance at least 60 mL/min Cardiovascular - No symptomatic congestive heart failure - No unstable angina pectoris - No cardiac arrhythmia Gastrointestinal - No gastrointestinal (GI) tract disease resulting in the inability to take oral medication or a requirement for IV alimentation - No uncontrolled inflammatory bowel disease - No active peptic ulcer disease Other - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception - No prior allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biological composition to perifosine - No other active malignant disease that could interfere with interpretation of study results - No ongoing active infection - No other uncontrolled concurrent illness - No psychiatric illness or social situation that would preclude study compliance PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - Not specified Chemotherapy - No more than 1 prior chemotherapy regimen for metastatic or locally advanced disease - Prior chemotherapy, given as a radiosensitizer, allowed in addition to single-line therapy - At least 3 weeks since prior chemotherapy (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin) and recovered Endocrine therapy - Not specified Radiotherapy - At least 3 weeks since prior radiotherapy likely to have myelotoxic effects (more than 3,000 cGy to fields including substantial marrow) and recovered Surgery - No prior GI surgery affecting absorption Other - No concurrent antiretroviral therapy for HIV-positive patients - No other concurrent investigational agents - No other concurrent anticancer agents or therapies", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "stage IV pancreatic cancer", "mesh_term": ["Pancreatic Neoplasms"], "id": "NCT00053924"}
