{"brief_title": "A Study of Three Different Anti-HIV Drug Combinations in HIV-Infected Patients", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of three anti-HIV drug combinations. The three combinations are: (1) efavirenz (DMP 266) plus indinavir; (2) DMP 266 plus zidovudine (ZDV) plus lamivudine (3TC); and (3) indinavir plus ZDV plus 3TC. This study also examines the resistance HIV may have to these drugs and if these drugs are effective over a long period of time.", "condition": "HIV Infections", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Zidovudine", "criteria": "Exclusion Criteria Concurrent Medication: Excluded: - Terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, triazolam, or midazolam (competition for the enzyme cytochrome P-450 3A4 [CYP3A4] by indinavir could result in inhibition of metabolic breakdown of these drugs and create the potential for serious and/or life threatening events [i.e., cardiac arrhythmia, prolonged sedation]). - Rifampin or rifabutin (prohibited because of potential drug interaction with indinavir). - Ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin. - Concomitant systemic therapy for acute opportunistic infection or malignancy. Excluded: Life expectancy less than 12 months. Prior Medication: Excluded: - Prior treatment with efavirenz, 3TC, an NNRTI, or an HIV protease inhibitor. - Prior antiretroviral agent within 14 days of initiating study treatment. - Prior treatment (within 30 days of initiating study treatment) with any other experimental drug for any indication. Patients must: - Have a diagnosis of HIV infection. - Have CD4 counts greater than or equal to 50 cell/mm3. - Have a life expectancy greater than or equal to 12 months. - Be post-pubescent.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "13 Years", "maximum_age": "60 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00002410.xml"}
