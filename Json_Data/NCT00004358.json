{"brief_title": "Phase II Study of Calcitonin for Tumoral Calcinosis", "brief_summary": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether intermittent, long-term, subcutaneous administration of calcitonin increases phosphaturia, reduces hyperphosphatemia, and increases intact parathyroid hormone levels in patients with tumoral calcinosis. II. Determine whether calcitonin reduces or prevents tumor recurrence. III. Determine whether hyperphosphatemia abolishes the normal circadian pattern of serum phosphorus. IV. Determine how repetitive calcitonin administration alters the biochemical markers of bone metabolism in osteopenic patients with tumoral calcinosis.", "detailed_description": "PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients are treated with subcutaneous injections of salmon calcitonin every 3 weeks. Ondansetron premedication and intravenous hydration are also administered. Patients are followed for disease progression and tumor recurrence.", "condition": "Calcinosis", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "calcitonin", "criteria": "PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA: --Disease Characteristics-- Histologically confirmed tumoral calcinosis --Prior/Concurrent Therapy-- Prior surgical resection of calcinotic lesion required", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00004358.xml"}
