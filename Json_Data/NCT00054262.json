{"brief_title": "T900607 in Treating Patients With Unresectable Liver Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of T900607 in treating patients who have unresectable liver cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the complete and partial response rates of patients with chemotherapy-na\u00efve unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma treated with T900607. - Determine the efficacy of this drug, in terms of duration of response and time to disease progression, in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. - Determine the safety profile of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive T900607 IV over 1 hour once weekly. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-35 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Liver Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["T900607"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically or cytologically confirmed unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) - Bidimensionally measurable disease defined as at least 1 lesion that is 1 cm or more in 2 dimensions by CT scan - Class A or B Child-Pugh liver classification - No prior CNS metastases or carcinomatous meningitis PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - 18 and over Performance status - Karnofsky 70-100% Life expectancy - At least 12 weeks Hematopoietic - Absolute neutrophil count at least 1,500/mm^3* - Platelet count at least 100,000/mm^3* - Hemoglobin at least 8.5 g/dL* NOTE: *More than 7 days since prior blood transfusions or growth factors Hepatic - Bilirubin no greater than 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) - Albumin greater than 2.5 g/dL - AST and ALT no greater than 3 times ULN - INR no greater than 1.5 (unless receiving anticoagulants) Renal - Creatinine no greater than 2 times ULN Cardiovascular - LVEF at least 50% - No New York Heart Association class III or IV cardiac disease - No acute anginal symptoms Other - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception during and for 3 months after study - No severe concurrent disease, infection, or co-morbidity that would preclude study entry - No other malignancy within the past 5 years except adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - No prior immunotherapy for HCC - No concurrent therapeutic biological response modifier Chemotherapy - No prior chemotherapy for HCC - No prior chemoembolization for HCC - No other concurrent cytotoxic chemotherapy Endocrine therapy - At least 6 weeks since prior hormonal therapy (an indicator lesion must exist outside the area of therapy - No concurrent hormonal anticancer therapy Radiotherapy - No prior radiotherapy for HCC - At least 6 weeks since prior radiofrequency ablation, selective internal radiation, or embolization (an indicator lesion must exist outside the area of therapy) - No concurrent radiotherapy (including palliative therapy) Surgery - At least 6 weeks since prior surgical resection (an indicator lesion must exist outside the area of therapy) - Recurrence at the margin of the surgical resection is allowed - At least 6 weeks since prior cryosurgery - More than 4 weeks since other prior major surgery Other - More than 4 weeks since prior investigational therapy - At least 6 weeks since prior intratumoral ethanol injection (an indicator lesion must exist outside the area of therapy) - No other concurrent investigational anticancer therapy", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "adult primary hepatocellular carcinoma", "mesh_term": ["Carcinoma, Hepatocellular", "Liver Neoplasms"], "id": "NCT00054262"}
