{"brief_title": "UMCC 9609 Tretinoin in Preventing Cancer of the Cervix in Patients With Cervical Neoplasia", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Tretinoin may help cervical neoplasia cells develop into normal cervical cells. It is not yet known whether tretinoin is more effective than a placebo in preventing cervical cancer in patients with cervical neoplasia. PURPOSE: Randomized clinical trial to study the effectiveness of tretinoin in preventing cervical neoplasia from developing into cervical cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether topical tretinoin reduces the number of viral genome copies of human papilloma virus (HPV) per cell and inhibits HPV E6/E7 gene expression in patients with cervical dysplasia. II. Determine the dose of tretinoin for use in a definitive trial that produces the best overall modulation of these biomarkers. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia classification (II vs III). Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 arms. Arm I: Patients receive low-dose tretinoin topically via cervical cap and polyurethane ether foam sponge changed daily for 4 days. Arm II: Patients receive intermediate-dose tretinoin as in arm I. Arm III: Patients receive high-dose tretinoin as in arm I. Arm IV: Patients receive placebo topically as in arm I therapy. Patients are followed for 6 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 180 patients (45 per arm) will be accrued for this study.", "condition": "Precancerous/Nonmalignant Condition", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "tretinoin", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically proven cervical dysplasia (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia II or III) Lesions must be delineated after colposcopic biopsy No pap smears suspicious for invasive carcinoma No positive endocervical curettage PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: Over 14 Performance status: Karnofsky 80-100% Life expectancy: Not specified Hematopoietic: Not specified Hepatic: Not specified Renal: Not specified Immunologic: No proliferative skin disorder (e.g., psoriasis) No diagnosed autoimmune disorders No allergy to tretinoin or latex Other: Not pregnant or nursing Negative pregnancy test Fertile patients must use effective contraception (except intrauterine device) during and for 3 months after study Normal diet with adequate protein and carbohydrate intake No in-utero exposure to diethylstilbesterol No prior malignancy No prior toxic shock syndrome PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: Not specified Chemotherapy: At least 1 week since prior tretinoin No prior retinoids (greater than 25,000 IU vitamin A or equivalent for at least 3 months) No other tretinoin during or for 3 months after study Endocrine therapy: No concurrent regular steroids Radiotherapy: Not specified Surgery: See Disease Characteristics Other: No concurrent regular anticoagulant medication No concurrent nutritional supplements other than 2 multivitamins per day", "gender": "Female", "minimum_age": "14 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00003598.xml"}
