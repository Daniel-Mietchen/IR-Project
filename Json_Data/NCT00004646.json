{"brief_title": "Phase III Randomized, Double-Blind Study of Prednisone for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy", "brief_summary": "OBJECTIVES: I. Characterize the effect of prednisone on muscle protein metabolism in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. II. Determine whether prednisone changes levels of insulin-like growth factor 1, growth hormone, and insulin. III. Characterize the effect of prednisone on muscle morphometry and muscle localization of utrophin. IV. Compare the prednisone response in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy to that seen in normal individuals and in patients with facioscapulohumeral dystrophy.", "detailed_description": "PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind study. Patients are randomly assigned to prednisone or placebo. Therapy is administered daily for 12 weeks; prednisone is then tapered.", "condition": ["Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["prednisone"], "criteria": "PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA: - Ambulatory males with Duchenne muscular dystrophy - No medical/psychiatric contraindication to protocol therapy - No requirement for regular use of prescription medication", "gender": "Male", "minimum_age": "5 Years", "maximum_age": "15 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "rare disease", "mesh_term": ["Muscular Dystrophies", "Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne", "Prednisone"], "id": "NCT00004646"}
