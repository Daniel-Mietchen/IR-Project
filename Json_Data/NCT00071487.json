Patients were randomly assigned, following stratification by the screening SELENA SLEDAI score (4 to 7 versus \u2265 8), to 1 of the 4 study arms (3 active arms and 1 placebo arm plus standard therapy for SLE). All patients were to be dosed on Days 0, 14, and 28, then every 28 days for the remainder of 52 weeks. Patients completing the 52-week period could enter a 24-week open-label extension; belimumab patients received the same dose or were switched to 10 mg/kg at the investigator's discretion and former placebo patients received belimumab 10 mg/kg.", "condition": "Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Belimumab 10 mg/kg", "description": "Belimumab 10 mg/kg IV plus standard therapy (SOC) for SLE; belimumab 10 mg/kg administered on Days 0, 14, 28, and every 28 days thereafter through 52 weeks in the double-blind period.
