{"brief_title": "Fenretinide in Treating Patients With Cervical Neoplasia", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Chemoprevention uses drugs to try and prevent development of cancer. Fenretinide may be effective in treating cervical neoplasia and preventing cervical cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized double-blinded phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of fenretinide to placebo in treating patients with cervical neoplasia.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of fenretinide (N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide; 4-HPR) at regressing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). II. Document the qualitative and quantitative toxicity of 4-HPR in women with CIN. OUTLINE: This is a double blinded study. Patients are randomized to receive either fenretinide or placebo. Patients are administered fenretinide or a placebo by mouth (PO) daily for 6 months with 3 days of rest every month. Patients undergo colposcopy, colpophotography, and Pap smears at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Patients undergo cervical biopsy at 6 and 12 months to assess changes.
