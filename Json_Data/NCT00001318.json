{"brief_title": "Treatment of Non-Tuberculous Mycobacterial Infections With Interferon Gamma", "brief_summary": "This is an open label study to determine the effects of the administration of Interferon-gamma on the clinical condition and immune function of patients with severe, treatment refractory non-tuberculosis mycobacterial infections. The study drug (interferon gamma) will be administered subcutaneously three times a week at 0.05 mg/m(2) for one year. We may also collect blood from the relatives of these patients and normal volunteers in order to characterize the genetic basis, if any, of our patients' disorders.", "detailed_description": "This is an open label study to determine the effects of the administration of Interferon-gamma on the clinical condition and immune function of patients with severe, treatment refractory non-tuberculosis mycobacterial infections.
