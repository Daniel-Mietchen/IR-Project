{"brief_title": "CCI-779 in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia", "brief_summary": "This phase II trial is studying how well CCI-779 works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as CCI-779, work in different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the activity of CCI-779 in patients with relapsed, refractory, or transformed chronic lymphocytic leukemia. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease (relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL] vs transformed CLL). Patients receive CCI-779 IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving an objective response may receive 3 consolidation courses of therapy.", "condition": "Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia", "intervention_type": "Other", "intervention_name": "laboratory biomarker analysis", "description": "Correlative studies", "arm_group_label": "Treatment (temsirolimus)", "other_name": "Torisel", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) - Relapsed, refractory, or transformed disease - Relapsed disease defined as symptomatic loss of a prior partial or complete response to a regimen containing a purine analog and/or a monoclonal antibody AND evidence of disease progression - Primary resistant disease defined as failure to achieve an objective response to a regimen containing a purine analog and/or a monoclonal antibody - Transformed CLL (Richters transformation), must meet both of the following criteria: - Histologically confirmed lymphoma - Measurable disease - No CNS disease - Performance status - ECOG 0-2 - Bilirubin \u2264 2 mg/dL (unless elevated due to Gilbert's disease) - SGOT and SGPT < 3 times upper limit of normal - Creatinine \u2264 2 mg/dL (unless due to organ leukemic involvement) - No symptomatic congestive heart failure - No unstable angina pectoris - No cardiac arrhythmia - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception - HIV-positive patients allowed provide CD4 counts are normal and no AIDS-defining disease is present - No history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biological composition to CCI-779 - No ongoing or active infection - No psychiatric illness or social situation that would preclude study compliance - No other concurrent uncontrolled illness - See Disease Characteristics - No concurrent prophylactic hematopoietic colony-stimulating factors - See Disease Characteristics - More than 2 weeks since prior cytotoxic chemotherapy and recovered - More than 2 weeks since prior radiotherapy and recovered - No other concurrent investigational or antitumor agents - No other concurrent cytotoxic agents - No concurrent combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-positive patients", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00086840.xml"}
