{"brief_title": "A Study of Xeloda (Capecitabine) in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer", "brief_summary": "This 2 arm study will assess the efficacy and safety of intermittent oral Xeloda, or iv fluorouracil/leucovorin, in combination with intravenous Eloxatin (oxaliplatin) in patients previously treated for metastatic colorectal cancer. Patients will be randomized to receive either 1)XELOX (Xeloda 1000mg/m2 po bid on days 1-15 + oxaliplatin) in 3 week cycles or 2) FOLFOX-4 (oxaliplatin + leucovorin + 5-FU in 2 week cycles.
