{"brief_title": "Treatment of Depression After Coronary Bypass Surgery", "brief_summary": "This randomized controlled trial will test the efficacy of (1) cognitive behavior therapy and (2) supportive stress management as treatments for depression in people who have recently undergone coronary artery bypass graft surgery.", "detailed_description": "Depression is a very common problem for people who have had CABG surgery, and recent studies have shown that it may increase the risk of additional medical problems and death during the first few years after surgery. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) has been shown to be efficacious for depression in otherwise healthy individuals, and supportive stress management (SSM) interventions have also been shown to improve depressive symptoms. These therapies have not, however, been tested for depression in individuals who have undergone CABG surgery. Participants will be screened for depression within 1 year after CABG surgery. Those who have depression will return for additional testing 1 week later. Eligible participants will be randomized to receive CBT, SSM, or usual care (UC), with no restrictions on nonstudy antidepressants, for 12 weeks. Patients will be monitored for worsening depression referred for additional care if needed. Depression, anxiety, and health-related quality of life will be assessed at baseline, 12 weeks after randomization, and 6 months after surgery (2 months after termination of CBT or SSM).", "condition": "Coronary Disease", "intervention_type": "Behavioral", "intervention_name": "Supportive Stress Management", "description": "Up to 12 weekly, individual, hour-long sessions, focusing on application of relaxation and other stress management techniques to depressogenic stressors", "arm_group_label": "2", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) surgery (alone or combined with valvular or carotid surgery) within past 12 months - Meets DSM-IV criteria for major or minor depressive episode Exclusion Criteria: - Severe cognitive impairment - Severe psychiatric comorbidity (e.g., alcoholism or schizophrenia) - Severely debilitating or life-threatening illness other than coronary disease", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "21 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00042198.xml"}
