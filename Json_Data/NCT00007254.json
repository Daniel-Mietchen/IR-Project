{"brief_title": "Morphine Gel for Bedsores", "brief_summary": "This study tests the effectiveness of a morphine-containing gel for reducing pain caused by pressure ulcers, also known as bedsores or pressure sores. We will apply the gel containing morphine, or the gel alone, directly onto painful pressure ulcers and compare the results.", "detailed_description": "In this study, we will apply a morphine-containing gel (or placebo) directly onto painful pressure ulcers. We will take participants off of any opioid-containing medications upon entry into the study. This allows us to measure any morphine that may enter into the bloodstream from the topically applied gel. The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of the gel for pressure ulcer analgesia, as well as the systemic absorption of morphine from the topically applied gel. We will document the amount of pain medications taken by participants to determine whether the gel decreases the need for these drugs.", "condition": ["Decubitus Ulcer"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Pain relief for pressure ulcers"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Presence of a Stage II pressure ulcer. - Pressure ulcer must be painful. - Primary Care physician must approve participation. - Thinking ability must be clear and intact. - Willing to change pain medication to oxycodone.
