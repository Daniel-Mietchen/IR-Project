{"brief_title": "17-DMAG in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Unresectable Solid Tumors or Lymphomas", "brief_summary": "This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of 17-DMAG in treating patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors or lymphomas. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as 17-DMAG, work in different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die", "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG) in patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors or lymphomas. II. Determine the safety and toxicity of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this drug in these patients. IV. Determine the recommended phase II dose of this drug for future studies. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine tumor response in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG) IV over 1-6 hours on days 1-3 or 1-5. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 1-2 patients receive accelerated escalating doses of 17-DMAG until at least 1 of 2 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Cohorts are then expanded to 3-6 patients who receive escalating doses (in a standard manner) of 17-DMAG until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience DLT. Patients are followed at 4 weeks.", "condition": ["Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma", "Angioimmunoblastic T-cell Lymphoma", "Extranodal Marginal Zone B-cell Lymphoma of Mucosa-associated Lymphoid Tissue", "Intraocular Lymphoma", "Nodal Marginal Zone B-cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Burkitt Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Diffuse Mixed Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Diffuse Small Cleaved Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma", "Recurrent Cutaneous T-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Recurrent Grade 1 Follicular Lymphoma", "Recurrent Grade 2 Follicular Lymphoma", "Recurrent Grade 3 Follicular Lymphoma", "Recurrent Mantle Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Marginal Zone Lymphoma", "Recurrent Mycosis Fungoides/Sezary Syndrome", "Recurrent Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma", "Splenic Marginal Zone Lymphoma", "Stage III Adult Burkitt Lymphoma", "Stage III Adult Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma", "Stage III Adult Diffuse Mixed Cell Lymphoma", "Stage III Adult Diffuse Small Cleaved Cell Lymphoma", "Stage III Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Stage III Adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma", "Stage III Cutaneous T-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Stage III Grade 1 Follicular Lymphoma", "Stage III Grade 2 Follicular Lymphoma", "Stage III Grade 3 Follicular Lymphoma", "Stage III Mantle Cell Lymphoma", "Stage III Marginal Zone Lymphoma", "Stage III Mycosis Fungoides/Sezary Syndrome", "Stage III Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Burkitt Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Diffuse Mixed Cell Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Diffuse Small Cleaved Cell Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma", "Stage IV Cutaneous T-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Stage IV Grade 1 Follicular Lymphoma", "Stage IV Grade 2 Follicular Lymphoma", "Stage IV Grade 3 Follicular Lymphoma", "Stage IV Mantle Cell Lymphoma", "Stage IV Marginal Zone Lymphoma", "Stage IV Mycosis Fungoides/Sezary Syndrome", "Stage IV Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma", "Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific", "Waldenstr\u00f6m Macroglobulinemia"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Other"], "intervention_name": ["alvespimycin hydrochloride", "laboratory biomarker analysis"], "description": ["Given IV", "Correlative studies"], "arm_group_label": ["Treatment (alvespimycin hydrochloride)", "Treatment (alvespimycin hydrochloride)"], "other_name": ["17-DMAG HCL", "KOS-1022"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: -
