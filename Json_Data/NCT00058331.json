{"brief_title": "Epoetin Alfa in Treating Anemia in Patients With Solid Tumors", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Epoetin alfa may stimulate red blood cell production and treat anemia in patients with solid tumors. It is not yet known whether epoetin alfa given once a week is more effective than epoetin alfa given once every 3 weeks in treating anemia. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to study the effectiveness of epoetin alfa in treating anemia in patients who have solid tumors.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Compare the effects of 2 different schedules of epoetin alfa on decreasing transfusion requirements in anemic patients with nonmyeloid cancer. - Compare the effects of these regimens on increasing hemoglobin levels in these patients. - Compare the effects of these regimens on overall quality of life (QOL) and anemia-specific components of QOL in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to concurrent chemotherapy or radiotherapy (yes vs no), concurrent platinum-based (cisplatin or carboplatin) chemotherapy (yes vs no), degree of anemia (mild [hemoglobin at least 9.0 g/dL] vs severe [hemoglobin less than 9.0 g/dL]), age (60 and under vs over 60), and type of neoplasm (plasma cell disorder [including multiple myeloma] or lymphoproliferative disorder [including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia] vs all other neoplasms). All patients receive epoetin alfa (EPO) subcutaneously (SC) once weekly for 3 weeks. Patients are then randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.", "condition": "Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific", "intervention_type": "Biological", "intervention_name": "epoetin alfa", "arm_group_label": "epoetin alfa - short term dosing", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Diagnosis of a nonmyeloid cancer (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) - Anemia secondary to cancer or cancer treatment* - Hemoglobin less than 12 g/dL (males) - Hemoglobin less than 11 g/dL (females) NOTE: *Active anticancer therapy is not required for study enrollment - Anemia must not be secondary to any of the following: - B_12, folic acid, or iron deficiency - Ferritin must be normal or elevated - Gastrointestinal bleeding or hemolysis - Primary or chemotherapy-induced myelodysplastic syndromes - No untreated CNS metastases PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - 18 and over Performance status - ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy - At least 6 months Cardiovascular - No history of uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias - No history of deep venous thrombosis within the past year (unless on anticoagulation) - No uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure at least 180 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure at least 100 mm Hg) within the past year (unless on anticoagulation) Pulmonary - No history of pulmonary embolism within the past year (unless on anticoagulation) Other - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception during and for 3 months after study participation - No known hypersensitivity to epoetin alfa, mammalian cell-derived products, or human albumin - No new onset of seizures within the past 3 months - No poorly controlled seizures - Able and willing to complete quality of life forms - Alert and mentally competent to give informed consent PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - More than 6 months since prior epoetin alfa - More than 6 months since any prior investigational forms of epoetin alfa (e.g., gene-activated epoetin alfa or novel erythropoiesis-stimulating protein) - No concurrent peripheral blood stem cell transplantation - No concurrent bone marrow transplantation Surgery - More than 14 days since prior major surgery Other - More than 2 weeks since prior red blood cell transfusions", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00058331.xml"}
