{"brief_title": "Optimizing the Effectiveness of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) in Treatment-Resistant Depression", "brief_summary": "This study will determine the effectiveness of adding S-adenosyl methionine to antidepressant drug treatment in reducing depressive symptoms in depressed people who have not responded to antidepressants alone.", "detailed_description": "Some people with depression do not respond well to antidepressant treatment. S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe) is a naturally occurring compound that may have antidepressant effects. SAMe may also enhance the effectiveness of other antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). This study will determine the effectiveness of oral SAMe in enhancing the effects of SSRIs in patients currently not responding to SSRI treatment. This study will last 6 weeks. No follow-up visits will occur. Participants will be randomly assigned to add either oral SAMe or placebo to their existing SSRI regimen for 6 weeks. Depression scales and self-report questionnaires regarding depressive symptoms will be used to assess participants at the end of the study.", "condition": "Depression", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Placebo", "description": "Placebo to be taken daily for 6 weeks", "arm_group_label": "2 Oral Placebo Pill Twice Daily", "other_name": "Pill identical in appearance to drug but placebo", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Major depressive disorder - Use of an SSRI for at least 6 weeks prior to study entry with partial or no response Exclusion Criteria: - History of psychosis - Allergy to SAMe - Alcohol or drug abuse in the past 3 months prior to study entry", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "80 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00093847.xml"}
