PURPOSE: Compassionate use of beclomethasone in treating patients who have graft-versus-host disease of the gastrointestinal tract that has not responded to previous therapy.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Provide beclomethasone dipropionate to patients with gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease refractory to standard therapy or with a contraindication to systemic steroids. - Minimize the serious side effects associated with systemic steroid use in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral beclomethasone dipropionate 4 times daily for 28 days in the absence of graft-versus-host disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may then receive a second course for 31 days if symptoms of graft-versus-host disease persist. Patients may receive up to 4 treatments (1 or 2 courses each) per year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-45 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.", "condition": "Graft Versus Host Disease", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "beclomethasone dipropionate", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Clinically or pathologically confirmed graft-versus-host disease of the gastrointestinal tract - Failed standard therapy with or has a contraindication to systemic immunosuppressive agents - No clinically significant intestinal infection (confirmed by stool culture) - No persistent vomiting of all oral intake - Not a candidate for approved beclomethasone dipropionate Enteron Pharmaceuticals protocol PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - 4 to 70 Performance status - Not specified Life expectancy - Not specified Hematopoietic - Not specified Hepatic - Not specified Renal - Not specified Other - Able to swallow medication PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - Not specified Chemotherapy - Not specified Endocrine therapy - See Disease Characteristics Radiotherapy - Not specified Surgery - Not specified", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "4 Years", "maximum_age": "70 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00055666.xml"}
