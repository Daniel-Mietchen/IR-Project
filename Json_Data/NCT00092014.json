{"brief_title": "A Study to Evaluate and Compare Alendronate and Risedronate on Bone Mineral Density in Women With Postmenopausal Osteoporosis (MK-0217-211)", "brief_summary": "This study is to evaluate and compare the effects of Alendronate and Risedronate to treat women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. The primary hypothesis for this study is that in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, treatment with oral alendronate 70 mg once weekly will produce a mean percent increase from baseline in hip trochanter bone mineral density (BMD) at 12 and 24 months which is greater than that observed with oral risedronate 35 mg once weekly.", "condition": "Postmenopausal Osteoporosis", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Alendronate placebo", "description": "Alendronate placebo was taken once weekly for up to 24 months. Medications were taken fasting which was maintained for 30 minutes postdose.", "arm_group_label": "Risendronate 35 mg", "other_name": "Atelvia\u00ae", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Women with postmenopausal osteoporosis Exclusion Criteria: - Bilateral hip replacements - Esophageal abnormalities - Metabolic bone disease (example - Vitamin D deficiency) - Medications that would affect the breakdown or build-up of bone turnover", "gender": "Female", "minimum_age": "25 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00092014.xml"}
