{"brief_title": "Telbivudine Versus Lamivudine in Adults With Decompensated Chronic Hepatitis B and Evidence of Cirrhosis", "brief_summary": "This research study was conducted to compare the safety and effectiveness of the investigational medication, LdT (Telbivudine) versus Lamivudine, a drug currently approved by the US, European and Asian Health Authorities for the treatment of Hepatitis B infection. The results for patients taking LdT will be compared to results for patients taking lamivudine.", "detailed_description": "Multicenter, multinational, randomized, double-blind study designed to compare the safety and efficacy of telbivudine (600 mg/day) versus lamivudine (100 mg/day) for 104 weeks in adults with decompensated chronic hepatitis B and evidence of cirrhosis. Patients were pre-stratified by screening Child-Turcotte-Pugh score (CTP score < 9 or \u2265 9) and ALT level (within normal limits (WNL) or > 1.0 x ULN) to help assure similar degrees of hepatic insufficiency and liver inflammation on both treatment arms. After 104 weeks of treatment, participants were followed-up with for an additional 16 weeks.", "condition": ["Hepatitis", "Hepatitis B, Chronic", "Cirrhosis"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Telbivudine", "Lamivudine", "Placebo"], "description": ["600mg/day oral tablet for 104 weeks", "100mg/day oral tablet for 104 weeks", "Telbivudine matching placebo or lamivudine matching placebo tablet."], "arm_group_label": ["Telbivudine 600 mg", "Lamivudine 100 mg", "Telbivudine 600 mg", "Lamivudine 100 mg"], "other_name": ["LDT600"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Documented decompensated chronic hepatitis B defined by all of the following: 1.
