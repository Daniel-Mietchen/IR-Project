{"brief_title": "Lycopene in Preventing Prostate Cancer in Healthy Participants", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain substances to try to prevent the development or recurrence of cancer. The dietary supplement lycopene may prevent the development of prostate cancer. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of lycopene in preventing prostate cancer in healthy participants.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the toxicity and safety of lycopene supplementation as chemoprevention for prostate cancer in healthy participants. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this agent in these participants. - Determine the dose range of this agent in these participants. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Participants ingest a single-dose of oral lycopene over a maximum of 15 minutes on day 1. Cohorts of 5 participants receive escalating doses of lycopene until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 5 participants experience dose-limiting toxicity. Participants are evaluated periodically for 28 days. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 participants will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Prostate Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Dietary Supplement"], "intervention_name": ["lycopene"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Healthy participants in good medical condition - No chronic medical conditions - No regular use of prescription medications - No evidence of psychiatric disorder - Non-smoker - Former smokers allowed provided they have not smoked within the past 3 months - No history of alcohol abuse - Serum lycopene concentration < 700 nM PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - 18 to 45 Performance status - Karnofsky 100% Life expectancy - Not specified Hematopoietic - Hemoglobin \u2265 13.0 g/dL - WBC \u2265 4,000/mm^3 - Platelet count 150,000-400,000/mm^3 Hepatic - AST and ALT \u2264 75 U/L - Bilirubin \u2264 2.0 mg/dL - No liver disease Renal - Creatinine \u2264 1.5 mg/dL - No renal disease Cardiovascular - No cardiovascular disease - No abnormal EKG Other - Within 15% of ideal body weight - No history of gastrointestinal malabsorption or other condition that would preclude drug absorption - No alcohol consumption within the past 72 hours - No allergy to tomato-based products - No history of cancer - No diabetes mellitus - No other illness that would preclude study participation PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - Not specified Chemotherapy - Not specified Endocrine therapy - Not specified Radiotherapy - Not specified Surgery - Not specified Other - At least 4 weeks since prior experimental drugs - More than 14 days since prior prescription drugs - No concurrent participation in another experimental trial - No concurrent prescription drugs", "gender": "Male", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "45 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "Accepts Healthy Volunteers", "keyword": "prostate cancer", "mesh_term": ["Prostatic Neoplasms", "Lycopene", "Carotenoids"], "id": "NCT00093561"}
