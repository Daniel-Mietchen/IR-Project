{"brief_title": "Study of Combination PS-341 and Thalidomide in Multiple Myeloma", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to assess the toxicity of PS-341 combined with one of four doses of thalidomide in patients with refractory multiple myeloma, and to find the most appropriate doses of PS-341 and thalidomide in the combination.", "detailed_description": "Patients will be enrolled in groups of 6-10 patients, each receiving a low dose of PS-341 (1.0 mg/m2) and different dose levels of thalidomide (50, 100, 150, and 200 mg). The first six patients in each group will receive PS-341 alone for the first cycle, and thalidomide will be added on day 22. If the combination is found to be safe in these first 6 patients, the remaining patients in each group will be enrolled. Initially, these patients will receive PS-341 alone and thalidomide will be added subsequently, if deemed safe based on the first 6 patients in each thalidomide dose cohort.", "condition": "Multiple Myeloma", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Dexamethasone", "description": "A dose of 20mg for cylces 3-8.", "arm_group_label": "2", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - History of histologically documented multiple myeloma with relapsed or resistant disease, defined as previously treated with/without autologous stem cell transplantation and is either relapsing or is resistant after > 1 line of prior therapy for myeloma - Patients can not be eligible for MTRC phase III protocols of higher priority - Performance status of greater than or equal to 2 as per SWOG scale - Patients must have an absolute neutrophil count > 750/mm3, and a platelet count greater than or equal to 25,000/mm3 - No prior malignancy is allowed except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other cancer for which the patient has been disease free for at least three years.
