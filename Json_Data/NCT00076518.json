{"brief_title": "The Effect of Fish Oil Plus Fenofibrate on Triglyceride Levels in People Taking Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART)", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of fish oil supplements combined with the drug fenofibrate in treating elevated triglyceride levels in people taking anti-HIV drugs. The participants in this study will have shown no response to fish oil supplements or fenofibrate alone.", "detailed_description": "Although highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has decreased the morbidity and mortality caused by HIV infection, its use has been associated with lipid abnormalities, particularly elevations in serum triglycerides. Hypertriglyceridemia is a risk factor in the development of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease as well as pancreatitis. Lipid-lowering drugs called fibrates have been part of the recommended treatment for elevated triglycerides, but the response to fibrates is incomplete in a large proportion of people. Fish oil capsules containing large amounts of omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to decrease serum triglycerides. However, fish oil supplements or fibrates alone are often inadequate for treating hypertriglyceridemia in people taking HAART. This study will determine whether the combination of the two therapies will lower serum triglycerides in people on HAART more effectively than either therapy alone. This study comprises two steps. In Step I, participants will be randomly assigned to receive either fish oil supplements or fenofibrate. Participants will be evaluated for treatment response at Week 8. Those who have responded to their treatment will remain on their original single agent therapy through Week 18. Those who have not responded to treatment at Week 10 will move on to Step 2 and begin combination therapy with both fenofibrate and fish oil until Week 18. All participants will return at Week 22 for a follow-up visit. Except at the Week 10 visit, participants will be expected to fast prior to all study visits. Participants will remain on their individual HAART regimens for the duration of the study.", "condition": ["HIV Infections", "Hypertriglyceridemia"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Fenofibrate", "Fish Oil"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - HIV infected - Fasting LDL <= 160 mg/dL and fasting serum triglycerides >= 400 mg/dL within 28 days prior to study entry - Willing and able to adhere to a lipid-lowering diet and exercise program for at least 28 days prior to study start and for the duration of the study - Treatment with HAART for at least 3 months prior to study entry.
