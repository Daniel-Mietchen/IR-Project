{"brief_title": "Chemotherapy, Surgery, and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Gastric Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery may kill more tumor cells. E7296 was conducted to study neoadjuvant chemotherapy and postoperative chemoradiation therapy in patients diagnosed with high-risk gastric cancer using a new neoadjuvant regimen: paclitaxel plus cisplatin. It was hypothesized that this new neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery and chemoradiation therapy would be well tolerated and would have a high curative resection rate.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: Primary objective: To evaluate the tolerability and toxicity of neoadjuvant cisplatin plus paclitaxel and postoperative chemoradiation therapy with fluorouracil plus leucovorin calcium in patients with high-risk gastric cancer. Secondary objectives: To assess the pathologic response of gastric tumors to neoadjuvant cisplatin plus paclitaxel chemotherapy, and preliminarily assess the patterns of failure and disease free and overall survival. OUTLINE: Patients receive 3 courses of preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy given on day 1 every 21 days. Courses consist of an intravenous infusion of cisplatin and a 3 hour intravenous infusion of paclitaxel on day 1. Patients then undergo surgery for tumor removal on day 63, followed 4-6 weeks later by one course of daily intravenous bolus leucovorin calcium and fluorouracil for 5 days. Chemotherapy is repeated 4-6 weeks later for the first 4 days of week 1 and the last 3 days of week 5 of radiation therapy given 5 days a week for 5 weeks. Patients receive two more courses, 4 weeks apart, of fluorouracil and leucovorin calcium for 5 days 4-6 weeks after completing radiation treatment. Patients are followed every month for the first 3 months, every 3 months for the next 21 months, every 6 months for the next year, and annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30-42 patients will be accrued over 18 months.", "condition": ["Gastric Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Drug", "Drug", "Procedure", "Radiation"], "intervention_name": ["cisplatin", "fluorouracil", "leucovorin calcium", "paclitaxel", "surgery", "radiation therapy"], "description": ["Cisplatin was administered as part of the neoadjuvant regimen.
