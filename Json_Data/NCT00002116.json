To determine whether topical HPMPC therapy can induce re-epithelialization and healing of refractory mucocutaneous herpes simplex virus disease in AIDS patients. To evaluate the virologic effects of topical HPMPC therapy on herpes simplex virus shedding from refractory lesions.", "detailed_description": "Patients are randomized to receive topical therapy with placebo (vehicle alone) or HPMPC at either 0.3 or 1.0 percent once daily for 5 days.
