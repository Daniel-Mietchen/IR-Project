{"brief_title": "Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Advanced Cancer of the Urothelium and Decreased Kidney Function", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating patients who have advanced cancer of the urothelium with decreased kidney function.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate of patients with progressive regional or metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium with renal insufficiency when treated with paclitaxel and gemcitabine. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour followed immediately by gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment continues every 4 weeks for a minimum of 3 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-27 patients will be accrued for this study within 10-27 months.", "condition": ["Bladder Cancer", "Transitional Cell Cancer of the Renal Pelvis and Ureter", "Urethral Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["gemcitabine hydrochloride", "paclitaxel"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed progressive regional or metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium - Mixed histologies containing a component of transitional cell carcinoma allowed - Bidimensionally measurable disease - No clinical evidence of CNS metastases - Clinically unsuspected organ-confined prostate cancer found at time of cystoprostatectomy allowed PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 and over Performance status: - ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - Absolute neutrophil count at least 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 100,000/mm^3 Hepatic: - Bilirubin no greater than 1.5 mg/dL - SGOT no greater than 2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) and alkaline phosphatase normal OR - Alkaline phosphatase no greater than 4 times ULN and SGOT normal OR - SGOT less than 1.5 times ULN and alkaline phosphatase less than 2.5 times ULN Renal: - Creatinine no greater than 3.0 mg/dL - Glomerular filtration rate no greater than 50 mL/min Cardiovascular: - No history of American Heart Association class III or IV heart disease - No uncontrolled congestive heart failure - No severe cardiac arrhythmias Other: - Not pregnant or nursing - Fertile patients must use effective contraception - No preexisting peripheral neuropathy grade 2 or greater - No active unresolved infection requiring parenteral antibiotics within the past 7 days - No other malignancy within the past 5 years except curatively treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - No prior systemic biologic response modifier therapy for advanced disease - Prior intravesical BCG for superficial disease allowed Chemotherapy: - Prior intravesical chemotherapy for superficial disease allowed - No prior chemotherapy for advanced disease - At least 6 months since prior adjuvant/neoadjuvant methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (MVAC) or cisplatin, methotrexate, and vinblastine (CMV), or cisplatin as a radiosensitizer Endocrine therapy: - Not specified Radiotherapy: - At least 4 weeks since prior radiotherapy - No concurrent radiotherapy Surgery: - See Disease Characteristics - At least 4 weeks since prior major surgery and recovered Other: - No concurrent hemodialysis", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "recurrent transitional cell cancer of the renal pelvis and ureter", "mesh_term": ["Urinary Bladder Neoplasms", "Urethral Neoplasms", "Carcinoma, Transitional Cell", "Kidney Neoplasms", "Ureteral Neoplasms", "Paclitaxel", "Gemcitabine", "Albumin-Bound Paclitaxel"], "id": "NCT00005644"}
