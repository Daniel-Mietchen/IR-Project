{"brief_title": "Safety and Efficacy of INGAP-Peptide in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes", "brief_summary": "Insulin is a chemical that the body needs in order to use or store sugar. It is made by a type of cell called a beta cell which resides in an organ known as the pancreas. Type 2 diabetes is a disease where the beta cells are unable to meet a person's insulin needs. Sugar levels rise in the blood as a result. INGAP-Peptide is being tested to attempt to create new beta cells in the pancreas, and to improve the ability to produce insulin in type 2 diabetic patients.", "condition": "Diabetes Mellitus, Non-Insulin-Dependent", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "placebo", "description": "1.5 mL, once daily, self-administered SC injection for 90 days", "arm_group_label": "placebo", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria - Age 35-70 - Using >20 Units of insulin per day - HbA1c from 6.5% to 10% - No islet antibodies - Otherwise healthy", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "35 Years", "maximum_age": "70 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00071422.xml"}
