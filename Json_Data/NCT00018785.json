{"brief_title": "Living-Related Donor Bone Marrow Immunoregulation in Kidney Transplants", "brief_summary": "Diabetes and end-stage kidney, liver and heart disease are prominent health issues among veteran patients. Successful solid organ transplantation in the absence of chronic immunosuppressive therapy (specific acquired immunological tolerance) is a desirable therapeutic option. This project extends recent observations supporting the use of concommitant donor bone marrow cell infusion as a means of modulating the immune response in kidney transplantation, thereby allowing a substantial decrease or withdrawal of potentially toxic immunosuppressive drugs.", "condition": ["Kidney Disease"], "intervention_type": ["Procedure"], "intervention_name": ["donor bone marrow infusion"], "criteria": "Living related donor kidney transplant recipients and the living related donors.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "Accepts Healthy Volunteers", "keyword": "bone marrow", "mesh_term": ["Kidney Diseases"], "id": "NCT00018785"}
