{"brief_title": "Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study", "brief_summary": "The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) was a multi-center trial examining the ability of an intensive lifestyle or metformin to prevent or delay the development of diabetes in a high risk population due to the presence of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). The DPP has ended early demonstrating that lifestyle reduced diabetes onset by 58% and metformin reduced diabetes onset by 31%. The DPPOS is designed to take advantage of the scientifically and clinically valuable DPP participants. This group of participants is nearly 50% minority and represents the largest IFG/IGT population ever studied. Clinically important research questions remain that focus on 1) durability of the prior DPP intervention, 2) determination of the clinical course of precisely known new onset diabetes, in particular regarding microvascular disease, CVD risk factors and atherosclerosis, 3) close examination of these topics in men vs women and in minority populations.", "detailed_description": "The current DPPOS Executive Summary and protocol, as well as DPP protocol and lifestyle manuals and publications are available at: http://www.bsc.gwu.edu/dpp/index.htmlvdoc", "condition": ["Diabetes Mellitus"], "intervention_type": ["Behavioral", "Drug", "Behavioral"], "intervention_name": ["Group Lifestyle", "Metformin", "Boost Lifestyle"], "description": ["Quarterly group lifestyle sessions", "Administered as 850mg twice per day", "In addition to quarterly group, 2 additional classes per year and an annual 15 minute check-up."], "arm_group_label": ["1 BLS", "2 MLS", "3 GLS", "2 MLS", "1 BLS"], "other_name": ["Glucophage"], "criteria": "Participation as a volunteer in the DPP.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "25 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "Microvascular disease", "mesh_term": ["Diabetes Mellitus", "Metformin"], "id": "NCT00038727"}
