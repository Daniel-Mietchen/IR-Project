{"brief_title": "Study of Lung Function in Children Who Have Undergone Bone Marrow Transplantation", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Assessing the long-term effects of bone marrow transplant on lung function in patients may improve the ability to plan treatment. PURPOSE: This clinical trial studies lung function in pediatric patients who have undergone bone marrow transplant.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the delayed effects of bone marrow transplantation preparative regimens on pulmonary function in children surviving at least 5 years after transplantation for hematologic malignancy. - Determine the relationship between pulmonary function and growth rates in these patients. - Determine the effect of growth hormone treatment on pulmonary function in these patients. - Determine the relationship between pulmonary function and age at time of transplantation in these patients. - Determine the incidence and severity of restrictive pulmonary disease, and whether these factors vary with increasing time after transplantation in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients undergo respiratory history, signs and symptoms assessment, pulmonary function tests (PFT) including spirometry, lung volumes, and diffusion, oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry, and height measurement. Patients are assessed at 5-10 years, 10-15 years, and over 15 years after bone marrow transplantation. Patients with abnormal PFTs are assessed at more frequent intervals as clinically indicated. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 280 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": "Pulmonary Complications", "intervention_type": "Procedure", "intervention_name": "management of therapy complications", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Patients who have undergone bone marrow transplantation for hematologic malignancy at least 5 years ago - Disease-free survivors at least 6 years of age AND - Under 18 years of age at time of transplantation - Received prior allogeneic, unrelated donor, syngeneic, or autologous bone marrow transplantation - Able to perform pulmonary function tests PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - See Disease Characteristics Performance status: - Not specified Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - Not specified Hepatic: - Not specified Renal: - Not specified PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - See Disease Characteristics Chemotherapy: - Not specified Endocrine therapy: - Not specified Radiotherapy: - Not specified Surgery: - Not specified Other: - Any prior preparative regimen allowed", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "17 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00009711.xml"}
