{"brief_title": "Phase II Randomized Study of Collagenase in Patients With Residual Type Dupuytren's Disease", "brief_summary": "OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the safety and efficacy of collagenase in improving flexion deformity, range of motion, and grip strength in patients with residual Dupuytren's disease.", "detailed_description": "PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, investigator-blinded, placebo-controlled study. Patients receive a single dose of either collagenase or placebo into the target finger on day 0. Patients who do not respond at the 1 month follow up visit may receive an injection of open label collagenase, if IgE antibody levels are no greater than 15 ng/mL. Following treatment, patients use a nighttime extension splint for 4 months and perform finger flexion/extension exercises. Patients are followed at 1, 7, and 14 days, and at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, for each joint treated.
