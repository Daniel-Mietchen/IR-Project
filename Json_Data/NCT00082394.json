{"brief_title": "A Study Comparing The Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of Trizivir VS Combivir & Atazanavir In Subjects With HIV", "brief_summary": "The aim of this study was to assess whether TRIZIVIR, administered twice-daily was as safe, tolerable and efficacious as a combination of the drugs COMBIVIR administered twice-daily and atazanavir administered once daily. Over the course of 48 weeks, various parameters that measure safety, tolerability and efficacy of the investigational drugs were measured and compared.", "detailed_description": "A Phase IV Randomized, Multicenter, Open-Label Study to Compare the Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of Trizivir (abacavir 300mg, lamivudine 150mg, and zidovudine 300mg) BID vs Combivir (lamivudine 150mg and zidovudine 300mg) BID plus atazanavir 400mg QD in Antiretroviral Naive HIV-1 Infected Subjects over 48 Weeks", "condition": ["HIV Infection"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Trizivir", "atazanavir", "Combivir"], "other_name": ["Trizivir", "atazanavir"], "criteria": "Inclusion criteria: - Adults with documented HIV-1 infection. - Past use of HIV drugs must have been less than 15 days. - Plasma HIV-1 RNA between 500 and 20,000 copies/mL. - CD4+ cell count greater than 100 cells/mm3. - Willing/able to provide written informed consent.
