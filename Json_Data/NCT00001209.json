This will not be a randomized study but will be comparable to the large data base of similar patients treated on successive Pediatric Branch studies.", "detailed_description": "This protocol is designed to test the feasibility of the administration of vincristine, adriamycin and cytoxan, alternating with the newly developed regimen ifosfamide VP-16 as well as the efficacy of this therapy in addition to radiotherapy in producing complete responses and disease-free survival in patients with Ewing's sarcoma, primitive sarcoma of bone, peripheral neuroepithelioma, and soft tissue sarcoma.
