PURPOSE: Diagnostic trial to determine the effectiveness of analyzing blood and bone marrow to detect residual disease in patients who have previously treated hairy cell leukemia.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the sensitivity of flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and polymerase chain reaction in detecting minimal residual disease following therapy with cladribine in patients with hairy cell leukemia. OUTLINE: Blood and bone marrow samples are obtained from patients at time of bone marrow biopsies to assess minimal residual disease using flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and polymerase chain reaction. Patients are followed for 2 years or until disease relapse. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15 patients will be accrued for this study over 12-24 months.", "condition": "Leukemia", "intervention_type": "Other", "intervention_name": "immunohistochemistry staining method", "study_pop": "\n      ", "sampling_method": "Non-Probability Sample", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Clinically documented hairy cell leukemia Active or in remission Must have received prior cladribine and be undergoing bone marrow biopsies as follow up PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: Over 18 Performance status: Not specified Life expectancy: Not specified Hematopoietic: Not specified Hepatic: Not specified Renal: Not specified PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: Not specified Chemotherapy: See Disease Characteristics No prior chemotherapy following prior cladribine Endocrine therapy: Not specified Radiotherapy: Not specified Surgery: Not specified", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00005619.xml"}
