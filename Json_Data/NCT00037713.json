{"brief_title": "Survival in a Randomized Phase III Trial in Patients With Limited Disease (LD) Small Cell Lung Cancer Vaccinated With Adjuvant BEC2 and BCG", "brief_summary": "This trial is designed to test the impact of adjuvant BEC2 (2.5 mg)/BCG vaccination on survival in patients with LD Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC). Patients will be stratified by institution, KPS (60 - 70% vs 80 - 100%), and response to first line combined modality therapy (CR vs PR) that consisted of at least a 2 drug regimen (4 - 6 cycles) and a chest radiotherapy regimen. Patients will be randomized to one of two treatment arms: standard arm (Observational cohort) or best supportive care, or the treatment arm (5 intradermal vaccinations of BEC2 (2.5 mg) + BCG given on day 1 of weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, and 10.", "condition": "Carcinoma, Small Cell Lung", "intervention_type": "Biological", "intervention_name": "BEC2 Vaccine", "description": "5 vaccinations of BEC2 (2.5 mg) + BCG given day 1 of weeks 0,2,4,6 & 10.", "arm_group_label": "2", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Histo-cytologically proven SCLC - Limited disease at diagnosis - Age greater than or equal to 18 - Patients with a clinical response of CR or PR to first line combined modality therapy - KPS greater than or equal to 60 - Adequate bone marrow, liver and heart functions - Written informed Consent Exclusion Criteria: - Prior surgical treatment for SCLC - History of tuberculosis - NCIC CTG grade 3 local skin toxicity reaction (ulceration) to > IU PPD test > 5 IU - HIV positive - Splenectomy or spleen radiation therapy in medical history - Prior therapy to proteins of murine origin - Any second line therapy for SCLC - Investigational agent or immune therapy within 4 weeks prior to study randomization - Severe active infections - Active infections requiring systemic antibiotics, antiviral, or antifungal treatments - Serious unstable chronic illness - The use of systemic anti-histamines, NSAID or systemic corticosteroids - Any previous malignancy except adequately treated CIS of the cervix or non melanoma skin cancer or if previous malignancy was more than 5 years prior and there are no signs of recurrence - Pregnancy or breast feeding or absence of adequate contraception for fertile patients - Any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those conditions should be assessed with the patient before randomization in the trial.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00037713.xml"}
