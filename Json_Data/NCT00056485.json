{"brief_title": "Treatment of Depression in Nursing Homes", "brief_summary": "This study will implement a treatment for depression in a nursing home setting.", "detailed_description": "Depression in long-term care facilities is a significant public health issue. Up to 50% of nursing home residents are affected by significant depressive symptoms. The decreased health and limited cognitive ability of many nursing home residents makes treatment and research extremely challenging. This study will attempt to identify and implement treatments for depressed nursing home residents. Participants are randomly assigned to receive either an active intervention or treatment as usual for 6 weeks. The active intervention is followed by 4 weeks of maintenance. The intervention is implemented primarily by existing nursing facility staff and focuses on increasing opportunities for residents to experience pleasant events through increased levels of activity and positive affect. The maintenance treatment involves incorporation of protocol-based activities into patient care plans. Patients have a follow-up visit 12 weeks after the study. Psychiatric evaluations, depression and mood rating scales, observed affect and activity participation, behavior problems, and staff burden are assessed.", "condition": "Depression", "intervention_type": "Behavioral", "intervention_name": "Pleasant Events-Based Behavioral Intervention", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Nursing home residents - DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder or dysthymia or Research Diagnostic Criteria for minor depressive disorder with current Geriatric Depression Scale scores > 11 and Mini Mental State scores >= 14", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "60 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00056485.xml"}
