{"brief_title": "Perifosine in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Locally Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of perifosine in treating patients who have metastatic or locally advanced soft tissue sarcoma.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of perifosine, in terms of response rate and duration of response, in patients with untreated metastatic or locally advanced soft tissue sarcoma. - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. - Determine the early progression rate in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, non-blinded, multicenter study. Patients receive a loading dose of oral perifosine twice on day 1 and then once daily on days 2-21 for the first course. For all subsequent courses, patients receive a loading dose of oral perifosine once on day 1 and then once daily on days 2-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed for 1 month. Patients with stable or responsive disease are followed every 3 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18 months.", "condition": "Sarcoma", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "perifosine", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed metastatic or locally advanced soft tissue sarcoma that is incurable by standard therapies, including any of the following types: - Uterine sarcomas - Mixed mesodermal - Leiomyosarcoma - Endometrial stromal sarcoma - Alveolar soft part sarcoma - Angiosarcoma/lymphangiosarcoma - Fibrosarcoma - Hemangiopericytoma - Leiomyosarcoma - Liposarcoma - Malignant fibrous histiocytoma - Neurogenic sarcoma - Pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma - Synovial sarcoma - Unclassifiable sarcoma - Undifferentiated sarcoma - Excluded diseases include the following: - Bone sarcomas (e.g., osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, chondrosarcoma) - Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma - Carcinosarcoma - Kaposi's sarcoma - Malignant mesothelioma - Neuroblastoma - Gastrointestinal stromal tumor - At least 1 unidimensionally measurable site of disease (outside the previously irradiated area) defined as: - At least 20 mm by x-ray or physical exam - At least 10 mm by spiral CT scan - At least 20 mm by non-spiral CT scan NOTE: Bone lesions are not considered measurable NOTE: Patients whose sole site of disease is within a previously irradiated area are allowed if there is evidence of progression or new lesions in the irradiated field - No known brain metastases PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - 18 and over Performance status - ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy - At least 12 weeks Hematopoietic - Absolute granulocyte count at least 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 100,000/mm^3 Hepatic - Bilirubin no greater than upper limit of normal (ULN) - AST no greater than 2.5 times ULN Renal - Creatinine no greater than ULN Cardiovascular - No symptomatic congestive heart failure - No unstable angina pectoris - No cardiac arrhythmia Other - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception - No prior allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biological composition to perifosine - No other malignancy within the past 5 years except adequately treated nonmelanoma skin cancer or curatively treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix - No active or ongoing infection - No psychiatric illness or social situation that would limit compliance with study requirements - No other concurrent uncontrolled illness PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - Not specified Chemotherapy - No prior systemic chemotherapy for metastatic or locally advanced disease - At least 6 months since prior adjuvant chemotherapy - No other concurrent cytotoxic chemotherapy Endocrine therapy - Not specified Radiotherapy - See Disease Characteristics - At least 4 weeks since prior radiotherapy (except low-dose, non-myelosuppressive radiotherapy) - No concurrent radiotherapy to the sole site of measurable disease or for progressively symptomatic disease Surgery - At least 4 weeks since prior major surgery Other - No other concurrent anticancer therapy or investigational agents", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00053794.xml"}
