{"brief_title": "Phase III Ganciclovir +/- rGM-CSF for AIDS-Related CMV Retinitis", "brief_summary": "To determine whether co-administration of sargramostim (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; GM-CSF) improves tolerance to ganciclovir in patients previously intolerant because of neutropenia defined as an absolute neutrophil count less than 500 cells/mm3. To assess if improved tolerance of ganciclovir is associated with a favorable outcome as defined by a delayed time to progression of retinitis; to confirm the safety and co-administration of ganciclovir and GM-CSF; to assess the changes in the expression of HIV p24 antigen in the serum and number of T4+ lymphocytes in the blood of patients receiving ganciclovir with or without GM-CSF.", "condition": "HIV Infections", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Ganciclovir", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria Patient must have the following: - AIDS as defined by CDC criteria. - Retinitis as diagnosed by the study ophthalmologist. - Performance status 0, 1, or 2. - Ability to give informed consent and suitability of intravenous access for scheduled blood tests. - Patient may have Kaposi's sarcoma or basal skin cancer.
