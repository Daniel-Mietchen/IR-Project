{"brief_title": "Role of Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) in Development of Necrotizing Enterocolitis", "brief_summary": "Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious gastrointestinal disorder that primarily affects preterm infants. About 10% of babies less than 32 weeks gestation at birth will develop it. Overall, 30% of babies who develop NEC will die from it, with many others developing long term gastrointestinal problems. The most important factor in its development is a premature intestinal tract. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is an important growth factor in the development and maintenance of the gastrointestinal tract. This study will look for a relationship between EGF levels in premature babies and the development of NEC.", "condition": "Premature Birth", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Gestational Age greater than 23 weeks at birth - Birth weight greater than 500 grams - Age less than 72 hours of life", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "72 Hours", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00059449.xml"}
