{"brief_title": "Fish Oil and Alpha Lipoic Acid in Treating Alzheimer's Disease", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of fish oil and the antioxidant alpha lipoic acid on factors in the blood that are associated with the progression of Alzheimer's Disease (AD).", "detailed_description": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a serious condition associated with increased inflammation, cholesterol, and oxidative stress (a condition involving an excess of free radicals and a decrease in antioxidant levels). Fish oil and alpha lipoic acid, which have few side effects, may help relieve these problems; therefore, these supplements may slow the progression of AD, particularly when given in combination. This study will evaluate the effect of fish oil and alpha lipoic acid on inflammation, lipid levels, and oxidative stress. Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive fish oil alone, fish oil and alpha lipoic acid, or placebo for 1 year. AD rating scales as well as urine and blood tests will be used to assess participants. Participants will have monthly clinic visits during the study to monitor adverse events and to undergo various laboratory tests.", "condition": ["Alzheimer's Disease", "Oxidative Stress", "Dementia", "Hyperlipidemia", "Inflammation"], "intervention_type": ["Dietary Supplement", "Dietary Supplement", "Other"], "intervention_name": ["Fish Oil", "Fish Oil and Lipoic acid", "Placebo"], "description": ["Fish oil concentrate (daily dose 3 grams containing 675 milligrams docosahexanoic acid and 975 milligrams eicosapentanoic acid) taken for 12 months.", "Fish oil concentrate(daily dose 3 grams containing 675 milligrams docosahexanoic acid and 975 milligrams eicosapentanoic acid) plus lipoic acid (daily dose 600 milligrams)taken for 12 months", "Soybean oil 3 grams a day and placebo lipoic acid 600 milligrams a day taken for 12 months."], "arm_group_label": ["Fish Oil", "Fish Oil and Lipoic Acid", "Placebo"], "other_name": ["Fish oil concentrate, omega-3 fatty acids", "thiotic acid, alpha lipoic acid"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's Disease or mild cognitive impairment - Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score between 18 and 26 - Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) of 0.5 or 1.0 - Fluent in English Exclusion Criteria: - Use of lipid lowering medications - Consumption of fish of more than twice a week - Use of omega and alpha lipoic acid supplements - Use of systemic corticosteroids, neuroleptics, anti-Parkinsonian agents, or narcotic analgesics - Depression - Any other serious health conditions that may interfere with the study - Enrollment in another clinical trial", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "55 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "Dietary Supplements", "mesh_term": ["Inflammation", "Alzheimer Disease", "Dementia", "Hyperlipidemias", "Thioctic Acid"], "id": "NCT00090402"}
