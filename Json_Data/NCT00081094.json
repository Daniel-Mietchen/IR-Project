{"brief_title": "Positron Emission Tomography Using Carbon-11 Acetate and Fludeoxyglucose F 18 in Detecting Hepatocellular Carcinoma (Liver Cancer) in Patients With Known or Suspected Liver Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Imaging procedures, such as carbon-11 acetate positron emission tomography (PET) and fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET, may improve the ability to detect hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer) and allow doctors to plan the most effective treatment. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well carbon-11 acetate PET and fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET work in detecting cancer in patients with liver cancer.", "condition": ["Liver Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Procedure", "Procedure"], "intervention_name": ["18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose-PET (FDG-PET)", "11Carbon-Acetate-PET"], "arm_group_label": ["PET scan (FDG-PET & 11C-acetate-PET)", "PET scan (FDG-PET & 11C-acetate-PET)"], "criteria": "INCLUSION: - Biopsy-proved HCC (stage I and II by conventional staging) or one or more of the following in a patient with clinically documented cirrhosis: - AFP > 200 mg/dL; - A contrast-enhancing tumor mass (>1 cm) by CT or MRI; or - A tumor mass confirmed by arteriography. - Patient must provide written informed consent and have completed conventional imaging and staging before initiation of PET imaging. EXCLUSION: - Pediatric patients under the age of 18 will be excluded from consideration from this study. - Patients with a known prior malignancy (with the exception of basal cell carcinoma of the skin and carcinoma in situ of the cervix) within 5 years will be excluded from entry into the study. However, patients with a prior HCC thought to have a new primary or recurrent HCC are eligible. - Pregnant and breastfeeding patients. - Patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (fasting blood glucose level > 200 mg/dL)", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "localized resectable adult primary liver cancer", "mesh_term": ["Carcinoma", "Carcinoma, Hepatocellular", "Liver Neoplasms", "Deoxyglucose", "Fluorodeoxyglucose F18"], "id": "NCT00081094"}
