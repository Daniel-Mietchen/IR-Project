{"brief_title": "Subcutaneously Administered Aldesleukin ( Interleukin-2; IL-2 ) Therapy in HIV-Infected Patients", "brief_summary": "To compare the effects of low-dose versus high-dose subcutaneous ( SC ) aldesleukin ( interleukin-2; IL-2 ) on immunologic and virologic markers in HIV-infected patients. To compare the effects of monthly versus bimonthly administration of SC IL-2 on these markers. Interleukin-2 is a protein that is naturally produced by lymphocytes. In an initial study, patients in an earlier stage of HIV-1 infection tended to tolerate SC IL-2 better than those with more advanced infections, and those with higher baseline CD4+ counts tended to derive the greatest benefit.", "detailed_description": "Interleukin-2 is a protein that is naturally produced by lymphocytes. In an initial study, patients in an earlier stage of HIV-1 infection tended to tolerate SC IL-2 better than those with more advanced infections, and those with higher baseline CD4+ counts tended to derive the greatest benefit. Patients are randomized to one of four treatment arms; patients receive either low-dose or high-dose SC IL-2 for 5 days either on a monthly or bimonthly schedule for approximately 6 months.", "condition": ["HIV Infections"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Aldesleukin"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria Patients must have: - HIV positivity. - CD4 count >= 500 cells/mm3. - No history of AIDS-defining opportunistic infection, or malignancy other than mucocutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma.
