{"brief_title": "Atrasentan in Treating Patients With Progressive or Recurrent Malignant Glioma", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of atrasentan in treating patients who have progressive or recurrent malignant glioma.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of atrasentan in patients with progressive or recurrent malignant glioma. - Describe the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. - Assess preliminary evidence of therapeutic activity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive oral atrasentan once daily. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 2-10 patients receive escalating doses of atrasentan until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 1 patient experiences dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 2 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 35 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": "Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "atrasentan hydrochloride", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed malignant glioma - Anaplastic astrocytoma - Anaplastic oligodendroglioma - Glioblastoma multiforme - Progressive or recurrent after prior radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy - Prior low-grade glioma that has progressed to high-grade after therapy allowed - Measurable disease by MRI or CT scan PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 and over Performance status: - Karnofsky 60-100% Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - Absolute neutrophil count at least 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 100,000/mm^3 Hepatic: - Bilirubin no greater than 1.5 mg/dL - Transaminases no greater than 4 times upper limit of normal - Hepatitis A, B, and C negative Renal: - Creatinine no greater than 1.7 mg/dL Cardiovascular: - No New York Heart Association class II, III, or IV cardiac disease Other: - HIV negative - Mini mental score at least 15 - No other malignancy within the past 5 years except curatively treated carcinoma in situ or basal cell skin cancer - No serious concurrent infection - No other concurrent medical illness that would preclude study entry - No alcoholism or drug addiction within the past 6 months - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - No concurrent anticancer immunotherapy Chemotherapy: - See Disease Characteristics - At least 3 weeks since prior chemotherapy (6 weeks for nitrosoureas) and recovered - No more than 1 prior chemotherapy regimen - No prior or concurrent polifeprosan 20 with carmustine implant (Gliadel wafer) - No prior atrasentan - No other concurrent anticancer chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: - No concurrent anticancer hormonal therapy Radiotherapy: - See Disease Characteristics - At least 3 months since prior radiotherapy and recovered - No concurrent anticancer radiotherapy Surgery: - No concurrent anticancer surgery Other: - Recovered from prior therapy - No more than 1 prior treatment regimen - No other concurrent investigational agents", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00017264.xml"}
