{"brief_title": "A Study of Ro 24-7429 in Patients With HIV-Related Kaposi's Sarcoma", "brief_summary": "To study the effects of Ro 24-7429 on tumor growth in patients with HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma. To study the safety and tolerance, effects on HIV replication, and immunologic effects of Ro 24-7429 in this patient population. To explore relationships between exposure to Ro 24-7429 and its metabolites with its antitumor and antiviral activities and drug toxicity.", "condition": ["Sarcoma, Kaposi", "HIV Infections"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Ro 24-7429"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria Patients must have: - HIV seropositivity. - Biopsy-proven mucocutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma with fewer than 50 skin lesions and measurable disease. - No active opportunistic infection. NOTE: - Patients with CD4 count >= 200 cells/mm3 must have no prior opportunistic infection, as well as no active opportunistic infection. - Life expectancy of at least 24 weeks. - Stable weight (+/- 2 kg) by 28 days prior to study entry. Exclusion Criteria Co-existing Condition: Patients with the following symptoms or conditions are excluded: - Other active malignancies (except basal cell carcinoma of the skin and in situ cervical cancer). - Known or suspected hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines. - Evidence of clinically significant cardiac, respiratory, hepatic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, hematologic, psychiatric, neurologic, dermatologic, or allergic disease as determined by the investigator. - Ongoing diarrhea (> two liquid stools per day). - Grade 2 or worse signs and symptoms of AIDS Dementia Complex. - Alteration of mental status that may interfere with study compliance. Concurrent Medication: Excluded: - AZT, ddI, or ddC. - Experimental antiretrovirals. - Biologic response modifiers or immunomodulating agents (e.g., interferon). - Colony stimulating factors (erythropoietin, GM-CSF, G-CSF). - Ganciclovir. - Foscarnet. - H-2 antagonists (cimetidine, ranitidine, famotidine, nizatidine). - Omeprazole. - Benzodiazepines. - Any other investigational compound. - Ongoing systemic treatment with corticosteroids (other than replacement therapy for adrenal insufficiency or short-term therapy of no more than 28 days for bronchial asthma). - Cytotoxic chemotherapy (systemic and local). - Drugs known to cause systemic toxicity, if avoidable (e.g., myelosuppressive, hepatotoxic, nephrotoxic, or neurotoxic drugs). - Paromomycin sulfate. - Chronic suppressive therapy for CMV and/or MAI. Patients with the following prior condition are excluded: History of serious adverse reactions to benzodiazepines. Prior Medication: Excluded: - Interferons or immune modulators within 4 weeks prior to study entry. - Prior systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy (patients with CD4 counts >= 200 cells/mm3 only). - Benzodiazepines within 14 days prior to study entry. - Intralesional chemotherapy for Kaposi's sarcoma within 2 weeks prior to study entry. - Therapy with antiretroviral drugs (including AZT, ddI, ddC, d4T) or investigational drugs within 14 days prior to study entry.
