{"brief_title": "Isoflurane at Subanesthetic Concentrations - 6", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to conduct experiments to examine subjective and reinforcing effects of nitrous oxide. Mood altering and psychomotor effects will be tested on non-drug abusers and preference procedures will be used to assess reinforcing effects. To test the hypothesis that isoflurane at subanesthetic concentrations does not reduce cold-water immersion pain in healthy volunteers.", "condition": ["Opioid-Related Disorders", "Substance-Related Disorders"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Other", "Drug", "Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["40% Nitrous oxide", "Sham comparator", "0.2% isoflurane", "0.4% isoflurane", "0.6% isoflurane"], "description": ["Used as pain assay positive control", "0% isoflurane in oxygen"], "arm_group_label": ["0% isoflurane", "0.2% isoflurane", "0.4% isoflurane", "0.6% isoflurane", "0% isoflurane", "0.2% isoflurane", "0.4% isoflurane", "0.6% isoflurane"], "criteria": "Please contact site for information.", "gender": "Male", "minimum_age": "21 Years", "maximum_age": "34 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "Accepts Healthy Volunteers", "keyword": "healthy volunteer", "mesh_term": ["Disease", "Opioid-Related Disorders", "Substance-Related Disorders", "Nitrous Oxide", "Isoflurane"], "id": "NCT00000254"}
