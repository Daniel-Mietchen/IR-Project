{"brief_title": "Docetaxel and Carboplatin With or Without Trastuzumab Before Surgery in Treating Women With Locally Advanced Breast Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel and carboplatin, use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. It is not yet known whether docetaxel and carboplatin are more effective with or without trastuzumab in treating breast cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well giving docetaxel together with carboplatin and trastuzumab before surgery works compared to docetaxel and carboplatin alone before surgery in treating women with locally advanced breast cancer.", "condition": "Breast Cancer", "intervention_type": "Biological", "intervention_name": "trastuzumab", "description": "Cycle 1-4 pre-op Day 1 4mg/kg IV Day 8, 15 2mg/kg IV\nCycle 5-7 post-op Day 1 4mg/kg IV Day 8, 15 2mg/kg IV\nCycle 8 Day 1, 8, 15 2mg/kg IV Day 22 6mg/kg IV", "arm_group_label": "Arm I (neoadjuvant therapy)", "other_name": "Herceptin", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Confirmed infiltrating adenocarcinoma of the breast - Primary breast cancer > 5cm, or skin/chest wall involvement, any N, without evidence of metastasis. - No prior radiation to the involved breast - ECOG (Electrocochleography) performance status 0-2 - Age 18 years to 80 years - Absolute Neutrophil count > 1500 cell/\u03bcl, platelet count > 100000 cells/\u03bcl and hemoglobin > 9 g/dl - All liver function tests < upper limit of normal - Serum creatinine < 2.0 mg/dl - Normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) as determined by MUGA (Multiple Gated Acquisition) scan or echocardiogram - HER-2/neu status is determined by a FISH (Fluorescence in situ hybridization) test.
