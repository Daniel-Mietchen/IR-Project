{"brief_title": "Vinorelbine in Treating Patients With Stage IIIB or Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving drugs in different ways may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether giving vinorelbine by mouth or infusion is more effective in treating non- small cell lung cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of vinorelbine given by mouth or as an infusion in treating patients who have stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the safety and efficacy of oral versus intravenous vinorelbine in patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer. II. Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens. III. Compare the pharmacokinetics of these treatment regimens in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive oral vinorelbine weekly. Arm II: Patients receive vinorelbine IV over 10 minutes weekly. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed several times during treatment and 4 weeks after treatment. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 195 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Lung Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["vinorelbine tartrate"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer not amenable to combination chemotherapy, curative surgery, or radiotherapy Bidimensionally measurable disease PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: 18 and over Performance status: Karnofsky 60-100% Life expectancy: At least 12 weeks Hematopoietic: Granulocyte count at least 2,000/mm3 Platelet count at least 100,000/mm3 Hemoglobin at least 10 g/dL Hepatic: Bilirubin no greater than 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) SGOT less than 2.5 times ULN Alkaline phosphatase less than 5 times ULN (except in cases of bone or liver metastases) Renal: Creatinine no greater than 1.5 times ULN Cardiovascular: No unstable or uncontrolled cardiac disease Pulmonary: No history of recurrent aspiration pneumonitis within the past 3 months Other: Not pregnant or nursing Negative pregnancy test Fertile patients must use effective contraception during and for 9 days after study Able to swallow capsules intact No active infection within the past 2 weeks No unstable or uncontrolled medical conditions No other prior malignancy within the past 5 years except basal cell skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix No history of peripheral neuropathy with severity greater than CALGB grade 1 PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: No prior immunologic therapy At least 1 week since prior hematopoietic growth factors or other blood products Chemotherapy: See Disease Characteristics No prior chemotherapy No other concurrent chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: Not specified Radiotherapy: See Disease Characteristics At least 4 weeks since prior radiotherapy Surgery: See Disease Characteristics At least 2 weeks since prior surgery Other: At least 4 weeks since prior investigational device or drug No other concurrent anticancer therapy No other concurrent investigational device or drug", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "stage IV non-small cell lung cancer", "mesh_term": ["Lung Neoplasms", "Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung", "Vinorelbine"], "id": "NCT00005865"}
