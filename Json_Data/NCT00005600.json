{"brief_title": "Axillary Drainage Following Lymph Node Dissection in Women With Stage I or Stage II Breast Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: The use of axillary drains may help to prevent complications following axillary lymph node dissection. PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is comparing three methods of axillary drainage to see how well they work following lymph node dissection in women with stage I or stage II breast cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Compare high vacuum drainage vs low vacuum drainage vs simple tube drainage in patients undergoing axillary surgery for stage I or II breast cancer. OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients undergo axillary dissection, then are randomized to one of three axillary drainage systems. - Arm I: Patients receive high vacuum drainage. - Arm II: Patients receive low vacuum drainage. - Arm III: Patients receive simple tube drainage (no vacuum). All drains are removed when daily volumes are below 30 mL or at 5 days after surgery, regardless of drain volume. Patients are followed at day 10 and at 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Breast Cancer", "Lymphedema", "Perioperative/Postoperative Complications"], "intervention_type": ["Procedure"], "intervention_name": ["management of therapy complications"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Diagnosis of resectable stage I or II breast cancer - Planned primary surgery of level II or III axillary dissection in association with one of the following: - Wide local excision (may be done through separate incision) - No breast surgery - Bilateral surgery allowed - No prior mastectomy - No immediate breast reconstruction using implants, latissimus dorsi, or rectus abdominus myocutaneous flaps at primary operation - Hormone receptor status: - Not specified PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 and over Sex: - Female Menopausal status: - Not specified Performance status: - Not specified Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - Not specified Hepatic: - Not specified Renal: - Not specified Other: - Not pregnant PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - Not specified Chemotherapy: - Not specified Endocrine therapy: - Not specified Radiotherapy: - No prior radiotherapy Surgery: - See Disease Characteristics - No prior axillary surgery", "gender": "Female", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "perioperative/postoperative complications", "mesh_term": ["Breast Neoplasms", "Postoperative Complications", "Lymphedema"], "id": "NCT00005600"}
