{"brief_title": "Temozolomide and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Brain Metastasis Secondary to Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs such as temozolomide may make the tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Combining temozolomide with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving temozolomide together with whole-brain radiation therapy works in treating patients with brain metastasis secondary to non-small cell lung cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the intracranial response rate in patients with brain metastasis secondary to non-small cell lung cancer treated with whole brain radiotherapy and temozolomide. Secondary - Determine the time to radiological progression in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the time to neurological progression (confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients undergo whole brain radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 2 weeks (10 fractions). Patients also receive concurrent oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-14. Beginning 3 weeks after the completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of neurologic (Central Nervous System, CNS) progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients were followed every 3 months for 2 years. ACCRUAL: A total of 26 patients were accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Lung Cancer", "Metastatic Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Radiation"], "intervention_name": ["Temozolomide", "Radiation therapy"], "description": ["Temozolomide (TMZ) to be given at a dose of 75 mg/m2/day for 14 days, starting on D1 of whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT).
