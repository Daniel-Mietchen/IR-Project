Patients previously treated with warfarin may be enrolled if warfarin therapy can be safely discontinued and baseline INR is <1.3 times control in the absence of heparin therapy. - Known allergy to Angiomax or hirudin derived drugs, or known sensitivity to any component of these products. - Patients receiving clopidogrel within the previous 5 days of randomization. - Patients receiving a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor within 48 hours if abciximab (ReoPro) or within 24 hours if eptifibatide (Integrilin) and tirofiban (Aggrastat) of randomization - Patients receiving lepirudin or argatroban within the previous 24 hours of randomization. - Patients receiving low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or thrombolytics within the previous 12 hours or unfractionated heparin within 30 minutes of randomization. - Patients with active or prior history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)/heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis syndrome (HITTS)*. - Participation in other clinical research studies involving the evaluation of other investigational drugs or devices within 30 days of randomization. - Refusal to undergo blood transfusion should it become necessary. - Any other disease or condition, which, in the judgment of the investigator would place a patient at undue risk by being enrolled in the trial or inability to comply with study requirements.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "Accepts Healthy Volunteers", "keyword": "Patients requiring off-pump CABG", "mesh_term": ["Bivalirudin", "Hirudins", "Calcium heparin", "Heparin", "Benzocaine", "Protamines"], "id": "NCT00073593"}
