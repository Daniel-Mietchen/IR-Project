{"brief_title": "Denileukin Diftitox in Treating Patients With Fludarabine-Refractory B-Cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Biological therapies, such as denileukin diftitox, may interfere with the growth of cancer cells and slow the growth of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well denileukin diftitox works in treating patients with fludarabine-refractory B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the complete and partial response rate in patients with fludarabine-refractory B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with denileukin diftitox. Secondary - Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients. - Determine the response rate in patients (regardless of CD25 receptor density) treated with this drug. - Determine the progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive denileukin diftitox IV over 1 hour on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete response after 8 courses proceed to follow-up. Patients achieving a partial response or stable disease after 8 courses may continue treatment at the discretion of the investigator. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then annually until relapse. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-44 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.", "condition": "Leukemia", "intervention_type": "Biological", "intervention_name": "denileukin diftitox", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Diagnosis of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) meeting the following criteria at any time during the course of disease (e.g., at initial diagnosis or relapse): - Absolute lymphocytosis > 5,000/mm^3 - Lymphocytes must appear mature with < 55% prolymphocytes - More than 30% of all nucleated cells are lymphoid on bone marrow aspirate smear - Lymphoid infiltrates compatible with bone marrow involvement by CLL on core bone marrow biopsy - Predominant B-cell monoclonal population of cells share the B-cell marker (CD19) with the CD5 antigen in the absence of other pan-T-cell markers by lymphocyte immunophenotyping - High-risk disease OR intermediate-risk disease - Patients in the intermediate-risk group must have evidence of active disease as demonstrated by at least 1 of the following criteria: - Massive or progressive splenomegaly and/or adenopathy - Weight loss > 10% within the past 6 months - Common toxicity grade 2-4 fatigue - Fevers > 100.5\u00b0F OR night sweats for more than 2 weeks without evidence of infection - Progressive lymphocytosis with an increase of > 50% over a 2-month period or an anticipated doubling time of < 6 months - Failed at least 1 prior fludarabine regimen, as defined by 1 of the following criteria: - Refractory or intolerant to fludarabine - Relapsed within 6 months after completion of fludarabine - No CNS leukemia - No mantle cell lymphoma in leukemic phase PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - 18 and over Performance status - Zubrod 0-2 Life expectancy - More than 2 months Hematopoietic - Absolute neutrophil count \u2265 1,000/mm^3 - Platelet count \u2265 50,000/mm^3 - Hemoglobin \u2265 8 g/dL (transfusion allowed) Hepatic - Albumin \u2265 3 g/dL - AST and ALT \u2264 2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) - Bilirubin \u2264 1.5 times ULN - No hepatitis B or C infection Renal - Creatinine \u2264 1.5 mg/dL OR - Creatinine clearance \u2265 40 mL/min Cardiovascular - LVEF \u2265 40% Other - No uncontrolled infection - No other concurrent serious illness - No HIV infection - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use two effective methods of contraception (one must be non-hormonal) during and for at least 1 month after study participation PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - Prior denileukin diftitox allowed Chemotherapy - See Disease Characteristics Endocrine therapy - No concurrent corticosteroids as anti-emetics Radiotherapy - No concurrent radiotherapy Surgery - Not specified Other - At least 28 days since prior anticancer therapy and recovered - No other concurrent antineoplastic drugs", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "120 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00082940.xml"}
