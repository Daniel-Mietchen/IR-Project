{"brief_title": "DC Vaccine Combined With IL-2 and IFN\u03b1-2a in Treating Patients With mRCC", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a patient's dendritic cells and tumor cells may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's lymphocytes to kill kidney cancer cells. Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of cancer cells. Combining vaccine therapy with interleukin-2 and interferon alfa may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving vaccine therapy together with interleukin-2 and interferon alfa works in treating patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (kidney cancer).", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the clinical response rate in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated with autologous dendritic cells (DC) loaded with autologous tumor lysate (DC vaccine) in combination with interleukin-2 and interferon-alfa. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. Secondary - Determine, within relevant immune pathways, the treatment-related, tumor-specific immune response in patients treated with this regimen. - Correlate tumor-specific immune response with objective clinical response in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: - Induction therapy: Patients undergo leukapheresis on day -9. Patients receive autologous dendritic cells (DC) loaded with autologous tumor lysate (DC vaccine) by intranodal injection on days 0 and 14; interleukin-2 (IL-2) IV continuously on days 1-5 and 15-19; and interferon-alfa (IFN-\u03b1) subcutaneously (SC) once daily on days 1, 3, 5, 15, 17, and 19. - Maintenance therapy: Patients undergo leukapheresis on days 33, 61, and 89. Patients receive DC vaccine by intranodal injection on days 42, 70, and 98; IL-2 IV continuously on days 43-47, 71-75, and 99-103; and IFN-\u03b1 SC once daily on days 43, 45, 47, 71, 73, 75, 99, 101, and 103. Patients are followed every 3 months.
