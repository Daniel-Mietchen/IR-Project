{"brief_title": "A Study to Evaluate the Use of a Protease Inhibitor and of Interleukin-2 (IL-2) in the Treatment of Early HIV Infection", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to look at the effectiveness of combination anti-HIV drug therapy (with protease inhibitors [PIs] or without) in patients with early HIV infections. This study also looks at whether a drug called interleukin-2 (IL-2) can boost the immune system of these patients. Doctors are not sure which anti-HIV drug combination is best to use in patients who have early HIV infection and have never received anti-HIV treatment. PIs are anti-HIV drugs that decrease viral load (level of HIV in the blood). However, PIs can cause serious side effects in some patients. Doctors would like to know if a drug combination that does not contain a PI is just as good as one that contains PIs.", "detailed_description": "Studies have suggested that an antiretroviral drug regimen of the non-nucleoside agent efavirenz (EFV) in combination with two nucleoside analogues is effective at achieving maximal viral suppression. This provides an alternative treatment to that of the more toxic PI-containing regimen. This trial examines whether a nonPI regimen with EFV is more beneficial than a PI-containing regimen when each is used in combination with the same two nucleoside analogues. A second part of the study looks at whether the addition of IL-2 may offer immunologic benefits as a co-administered drug. Patients are randomized to initiate antiretroviral therapy of a PI-based (stavudine/didanosine/ritonavir [RTV]/indinavir [IDV]) or nonPI-based (stavudine/didanosine/EFV) regimen. Within these treatment arms, they are stratified according to a positive or negative p24 antigen result. At Week 16, patients not achieving maximal viral suppression (lower than 50 copies/ml) have the option to add abacavir (ABC) or other drugs as intensification therapy. Those achieving virologic suppression (less than 50 copies/ml) are randomized either to receive IL-2 or not. At study entry, and after 12 months, tissue samples of CSF, lymph node, and genital secretions are obtained, with permission. Patients have physical exams, women of child-bearing potential have pregnancy tests, and blood samples are drawn at clinic visits 12-16 times a year over 3 years so that virologic and immunologic evaluations may be performed. Compensation for time and transportation is given.", "condition": "HIV Infections", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Aldesleukin", "description": "Subcutaneous injection equaling 15 x 10^6 IU daily dose.
