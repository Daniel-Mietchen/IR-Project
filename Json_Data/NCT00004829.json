{"brief_title": "Phase III Randomized Study of the Inhalation of Tobramycin in Patients With Cystic Fibrosis", "brief_summary": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety and efficacy of tobramycin in patients with cystic fibrosis who are chronically colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. II. Determine whether this treatment produces tobramycin-resistant bacteria at a frequency different from the placebo group and whether the emergence of resistance is associated with a lack of clinical response.", "detailed_description": "PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study. Patients receive tobramycin or placebo by inhalation twice daily for 28 days followed by 28 days of rest. This treatment is repeated twice, for a total of 3 courses of therapy. Patients are followed every 2 weeks for the first 8 weeks, then every 4 weeks, and then at 4 weeks after the last treatment.", "condition": "Bacterial Infection", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "tobramycin", "criteria": "PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA: --Disease Characteristics-- Documented cystic fibrosis with Pseudomonas aeruginosa present in a sputum or throat culture within 6 months prior to screening Sweat chloride at least 60 mEq/L --Prior/Concurrent Therapy-- At least 14 days since prior intravenous or aerosolized tobramycin or other antipseudomonal antibiotic At least 4 weeks since prior administration of any investigational drug No concurrent antibiotics by aerosol --Patient Characteristics-- Renal: - Creatinine less than 2 mg/dL - BUN less than 40 mg/dL - No proteinuria of 2+ or greater Pulmonary: - FEV1 at least 75% and at least 25% of predicted - Room air oximetry at least 88% saturation - Able to perform pulmonary function tests - No hemoptysis of 60 mL or greater within 30 days prior to study - No abnormal chest X-ray Other: - Not pregnant - Fertile females must use effective contraception - No history of positive culture with Burkholderia cepacia - No history of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency - No known local or systemic hypersensitivity to aminoglycosides, albuterol, or other beta-2 agonists", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "6 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00004829.xml"}
