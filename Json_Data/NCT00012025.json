{"brief_title": "ICI 182780 in Treating Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Estrogen can stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using ICI 182780 may fight breast cancer by blocking the activity of estrogen in the tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of ICI 182780 in treating patients who have metastatic breast cancer that has not responded to previous hormone therapy.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the complete and partial objective response rate and duration of response in women with metastatic breast cancer who have failed aromatase inhibitor therapy treated with fulvestrant. - Determine the time to disease progression and overall survival of women treated with this drug. - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these women. OUTLINE: Patients receive fulvestrant intramuscularly on day 1. Courses repeat approximately every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 5 years or until disease progression. After disease progression, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.", "condition": "Breast Cancer", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "fulvestrant", "arm_group_label": "fulvestrant", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the breast - Progressive local-regional or metastatic disease - Unconfirmed new or progressive multiple pulmonary nodules or unequivocal radiographic evidence of multiple bone metastases allowed - At least 1 measurable lesion - At least 20 mm by CT scan or MRI OR at least 10 mm by spiral CT scan - Nonmeasurable disease includes the following: - Bone lesions - Leptomeningeal disease - Ascites - Pleural/pericardial effusions - Lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis - Inflammatory breast disease - Abdominal masses not confirmed and followed by imaging techniques - Cystic lesions - Disease progression after prior third-generation aromatase inhibitor (e.g., anastrozole, exemestane, letrozole, or vorozole) - Failed no more than 1 prior additive hormonal therapy (e.g., aromatase inhibitor with or without tamoxifen) - Disease recurrence identified no more than 12 months since the last prior adjuvant tamoxifen treatment - Oophorectomy, ovarian radiotherapy, and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) analogs not considered hormonal therapy regimens - No brain or leptomeningeal metastases - No hepatic metastases involving more than one-third of the liver - No symptomatic pulmonary lymphangitic disease - Evidence of hormone sensitivity as defined by: - Relapse after at least 12 months of adjuvant hormonal treatment - Tumor remission or stabilization before progression for at least 6 months after prior hormonal therapy for advanced disease - Postmenopausal as defined by one of the following: - At least 12 months since last menstrual period - 4-11 months since last menstrual period and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in the postmenopausal range - Prior castration and castrate FSH levels within the postmenopausal range - Hysterectomy without oophorectomy (FSH in postmenopausal range if age 60 and under) - Hormone receptor status: - Estrogen-receptor and/or progesterone-receptor positive - At least 10 fmol/mg cytosol protein OR - Positive by immunohistochemistry PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 and over Sex: - Female Menopausal status: - See Disease Characteristics - Postmenopausal Performance status: - ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy: - At least 3 months Hematopoietic: - WBC at least 2,000/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 100,000/mm^3 - No history of bleeding diathesis Hepatic: - See Disease Characteristics - Bilirubin no greater than 0.8 mg/dL above upper limit of normal (ULN) - INR no greater than 1.6 - No hepatitis B or C - No severe hepatic impairment Renal: - Calcium no greater than 10% above ULN - Creatinine no greater than 1 mg/dL above ULN - No severe renal impairment Cardiovascular: - No unstable or uncompensated cardiac condition Pulmonary: - No unstable or uncompensated respiratory condition Other: - HIV negative - No AIDS - No other severe condition or systemic disease that would preclude study participation PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - Prior trastuzumab (Herceptin) allowed Chemotherapy: - Prior adjuvant chemotherapy allowed - No more than 1 prior chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease Endocrine therapy: - See Disease Characteristics - More than 4 weeks since prior estrogen replacement therapy - More than 3 months since prior LH-RH analogs - No other prior additive hormonal therapy except third-generation aromatase inhibitors or tamoxifen Radiotherapy: - See Disease Characteristics - Concurrent radiotherapy for control of bone pain or other reasons due to established bone lesions allowed if radiotherapy field is no more than 30% of bone marrow Surgery: - See Disease Characteristics Other: - More than 4 weeks since prior investigational drug for breast cancer - No concurrent long-term warfarin - Concurrent bisphosphonates allowed if dose stable - Concurrent long-term antiplatelet therapy allowed", "gender": "Female", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00012025.xml"}
