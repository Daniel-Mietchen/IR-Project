{"brief_title": "The Safety and Effectiveness of Indinavir Sulfate Plus Efavirenz", "brief_summary": "To estimate the differences in parameters of antiviral activity and safety between a control regimen of indinavir in combination with DMP 266 and an experimental regimen of higher-dose indinavir in combination with lower-dose DMP 266 after sixteen weeks of dosing, in protease inhibitor- and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-naive, HIV-1 seropositive patients. It is hypothesized that after 16 weeks of randomized treatment with either the control or experimental regimen that: 1. The observed proportion of patients with serum viral RNA < 400 copies/ml in the experimental and control regimen will be similar and will continue to be so after 48 weeks. 2. The safety profiles of the two groups will be similar, judged by the incidence of serious, drug-related adverse experiences and the incidence of events of specific interest (e.g., nephrolithiasis, hyperbilirubinemia, nausea/vomiting, rash, and CNS-related symptoms) and will continue to be so after 48 weeks. 3. The two groups will be similar with respect to changes from baseline in serum viral RNA and CD4 counts and will continue to be so after 48 weeks.", "detailed_description": "It is hypothesized that after 16 weeks of randomized treatment with either the control or experimental regimen that: 1.
