FEV1/h2, VC/h2 and FEV1/IVC were studied, using graphic smooth techniques and regression analyses techniques on both cross-sectional and longitudinal datasets. In addition, the investigators tested the hypothesis stating that early adult symptoms of asthma, increased bronchial responsiveness, markers of allergy influenced who became a smoker, influenced the amount smoked and/or influenced who stopped smoking relatively early in adult life, using logistic regression analyses and survival analyses. The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the \"End Date\" entered in the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.", "condition": ["Asthma", "Lung Diseases, Obstructive", "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease"], "criteria": "No eligibility criteria", "gender": "Male", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "100 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "mesh_term": ["Lung Diseases", "Lung Diseases, Obstructive", "Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive"], "id": "NCT00005425"}
