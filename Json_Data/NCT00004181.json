{"brief_title": "Bone Marrow Transplantation in Treating Patients With Multiple Myeloma, Chronic Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia, or Agnogenic Myeloid Metaplasia", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Bone marrow transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were destroyed by the chemotherapy or radiation therapy that was used to kill cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in treating patients who have multiple myeloma, chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia, or agnogenic myeloid metaplasia.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) following high-dose cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation in patients with multiple myeloma, agnogenic myeloid metaplasia, or chronic myelogenous leukemia in first or second chronic phase. - Determine the efficacy of BMT following busulfan and cyclophosphamide in these patients. - Determine the toxic effects of these preparative regimens in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by remission (first vs second vs third). Patients who have not undergone prior radiotherapy receive cyclophosphamide IV on days -6 and -5 and then undergo total body irradiation twice a day on days -4 to -1. Allogeneic bone marrow is infused on day 0. Patients who have undergone prior radiotherapy receive oral busulfan every 6 hours on days -7 to -4 or -6 to -3 and cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -3 and -2. Allogeneic bone marrow is infused on day 0. Patients are followed at days 30 and 90, at 6 months, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.", "condition": ["Chronic Myeloproliferative Disorders", "Leukemia", "Multiple Myeloma and Plasma Cell Neoplasm"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Procedure", "Radiation"], "intervention_name": ["busulfan", "cyclophosphamide", "allogeneic bone marrow transplantation", "radiation therapy"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Cytologically proven disease of one of the following types with transfusion-dependent anemia or thrombocytopenia (less than 50,000/mm^3): - Multiple myeloma - Agnogenic myeloid metaplasia - Chronic myelogenous leukemia in first or second chronic phase - Philadelphia chromosome with BCR gene rearrangement - Suitable sibling bone marrow donor available PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 15 to physiologic 55 Performance status: - ECOG 0 or 1 Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - See Disease Characteristics Hepatic: - Bilirubin no greater than 2.0 mg/dL - SGOT less than 2 times normal - Alkaline phosphatase less than 2 times normal Renal: - Creatinine less than 2 mg/dL Cardiovascular: - Ejection fraction normal by MUGA - No acute myocardial infarction within the past 6 months - No active angina pectoris - No active congestive heart failure Pulmonary: - FEV greater than 50% predicted - DLCO at least 50% Other: - HIV negative - No active infection - No concurrent organ damage or medical problems that would preclude therapy PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: - Not specified", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "15 Years", "maximum_age": "55 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukemia", "mesh_term": ["Leukemia", "Multiple Myeloma", "Neoplasms, Plasma Cell", "Leukemia, Myeloid", "Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive", "Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase", "Plasmacytoma", "Myeloproliferative Disorders", "Cyclophosphamide", "Busulfan"], "id": "NCT00004181"}
