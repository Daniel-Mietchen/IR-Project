{"brief_title": "Oblimersen and Imatinib Mesylate in Treating Patients With Advanced Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors That Cannot Be Removed By Surgery", "brief_summary": "Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth. Oblimersen may help imatinib mesylate kill more tumor cells by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug. This phase II trial is studying how well giving imatinib mesylate together with oblimersen works in treating patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor that cannot be removed by surgery.", "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the efficacy of G3139 (bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotide) plus imatinib mesylate in GIST patients with limited or generalized progression after therapy with imatinib. II. To assess the safety of G3139 plus imatinib mesylate in GIST patients with limited or generalized progression after therapy with imatinib. III. To determine whether expression of BCL-2 correlates with survival, time to progression or response rate in patients with GIST treated with G3139 plus imatinib. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to extent of disease progression (limited vs generalized). Patients receive oblimersen IV continuously on days 1-14. Patients also receive oral imatinib mesylate on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 96 patients (48 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor"], "intervention_type": ["Biological", "Drug", "Other"], "intervention_name": ["oblimersen sodium", "imatinib mesylate", "laboratory biomarker analysis"], "description": ["Given IV", "Given orally", "Correlative studies"], "arm_group_label": ["Treatment (oblimersen sodium and imatinib mesylate)", "Treatment (oblimersen sodium and imatinib mesylate)", "Treatment (oblimersen sodium and imatinib mesylate)"], "other_name": ["augmerosen", "G3139", "G3139 bcl-2 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide", "Genasense", "CGP 57148", "Gleevec", "Glivec"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - A pre-imatinib paraffin block of tumor or 20 unstained slides should be submitted for correlative studies if available - All patients must have either \"limited\" progression on imatinib (arm 1, some but not all tumor foci progressing and are not amenable to local therapy) or \"generalized\" progression (arm 2, widespread progression of all tumor foci) after adequate therapy with imatinib mesylate (> or = 400 mg/day for at least 6 weeks) - Histologically confirmed diagnosis of Kit-expressing advanced GIST; advanced GIST is defined by patients who have disease that is unresectable; this includes patients with metastatic disease or primary tumors that cannot be safely removed by a sarcoma surgical oncologist - Measurable disease by CT; tests used to assess disease must be done within 28 days prior to registration.
