{"brief_title": "Carmustine Wafers Plus Irinotecan in Treating Patients With Recurrent Supratentorial High Grade Gliomas", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of carmustine wafers plus irinotecan in treating patients with recurrent supratentorial high grade gliomas.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Define the maximum tolerated dose of irinotecan given in combination with Gliadel wafers (carmustine) in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme, anaplastic astrocytoma, or gliosarcoma. - Define the toxicity of irinotecan given in combination with Gliadel wafers in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. All patients undergo surgical resection. At the time of surgery, up to eight Gliadel wafers (containing carmustine) are implanted in the resected tumor cavity. Cohorts of 3 patients each receive escalating doses of irinotecan IV over 90 minutes once weekly within 3 weeks after Gliadel wafer implantation. One course of treatment consists of 4 weeks of irinotecan and 2 weeks of rest. If 1 patient experiences dose limiting toxicity (DLT) at a dose level, an additional 3 patients are entered at that same dose level. If 2 patients experience DLT, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been surpassed and a total of 6 patients are treated at the previous dose level. The MTD is defined as the highest dose in which no more than 1 of 6 patients experiences DLT. Treatment continues for up to 12 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity and disease progression. Patients are followed for at least 4 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18 patients will be accrued into this study over 9 months.", "condition": ["Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Drug", "Procedure"], "intervention_name": ["carmustine", "irinotecan hydrochloride", "polifeprosan 20 with carmustine implant", "surgical procedure"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed recurrent supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme, anaplastic astrocytoma, or gliosarcoma - Must be able to undergo surgical resection - At least 1 bidimensionally measurable lesion documented on Gd-MRI within 72 hours after surgical implantation of Gliadel wafers - Not requiring immediate radiotherapy PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 and over Performance status: - Karnofsky 70-100% Life expectancy: - Greater than 12 weeks Hematopoietic: - Absolute neutrophil count at least 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 125,000/mm^3 - Hematocrit at least 29% Hepatic: - Bilirubin less than 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) - SGOT or SGPT less than 2.5 times ULN - Alkaline phosphatase less than 2 times ULN Renal: - BUN less than 1.5 times ULN - Creatinine less than 1.5 times ULN Neurological: - Must be neurologically stable Other: - HIV negative - No AIDS-related illness - No nonmalignant systemic disease that would make patient a poor medical risk - No acute infection requiring intravenous antibiotics - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test 24 hours prior to study - Effective contraception required of all fertile patients PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - Not specified Chemotherapy: - No prior irinotecan - At least 6 weeks since chemotherapy unless there is unequivocal evidence of tumor progression after chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: - At least 1 week of nonincreasing dose of steroids prior to study Radiotherapy: - At least 6 weeks since radiotherapy unless there is unequivocal evidence of tumor progression after radiotherapy - No concurrent radiotherapy Surgery: - Not specified", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "adult gliosarcoma", "mesh_term": ["Glioma", "Nervous System Neoplasms", "Central Nervous System Neoplasms", "Irinotecan", "Camptothecin", "Carmustine"], "id": "NCT00003463"}
