{"brief_title": "Suberoylanilide Hydroxamic Acid in Treating Patients With Advanced Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for cancer cell growth. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid in treating patients who have advanced cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid in patients with advanced solid tumors or hematologic malignancies. - Evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of this drug in these patients. - Determine the effects of this drug on absorption in the fasting and non-fasting states in these patients. - Determine any anti-tumor effects of this drug in these patients. - Correlate clinical outcomes with histone acetylation in circulating mononuclear cells and tumor biopsy samples in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are stratified according to disease (solid tumor vs multiple myeloma or lymphoma vs leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes). The initial 15-20 patients (in the solid tumor or multiple myeloma or lymphoma stratum) receive suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) IV over 2 hours on day 1 of week 0 and then orally once or twice daily beginning on day 1 of week 1. All remaining patients receive oral SAHA once or twice daily beginning on day 1 of week 1. Courses repeat every 4 weeks for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. In each stratum, cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SAHA until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed monthly for resolution of adverse events. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 114 patients (42 with solid tumors, 36 with lymphoma or multiple myeloma, and 36 with leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes) will be accrued for this study within 1 year.", "condition": ["Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["vorinostat"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - One of the following diagnoses: - Histologically confirmed advanced primary or metastatic solid tumor, including, but not limited to, the following: - Androgen-independent prostate cancer - Breast cancer - Ovarian cancer - Head and neck cancer - Non-small cell lung cancer - Bladder cancer - Kidney cancer - Diagnosis of lymphoma, multiple myeloma, leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), including, but not limited to, the following: - Intermediate-grade or follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma - Hodgkin's lymphoma - Patients with lymphoma or multiple myeloma must be ineligible for peripheral blood stem cell transplantation - For patients with solid tumors (except prostate cancer): - Disease progression based on development of new lesions or an increase in pre-existing lesions - Biochemical marker increase must not be sole criterion for disease progression - For prostate cancer patients only: - Disease progression based on rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values, transaxial imaging, or radionuclide scans - Increase in disease-related symptoms must not be sole manifestation of progression - Patients receiving an antiandrogen as part of first-line hormonal therapy must show disease progression off of the antiandrogen prior to study - Biochemical progression (at least 25% increase over range of values) defined as 1 of the following: - Rising PSA documented by at least 3 consecutive measurements obtained at least 1 week apart - Rising PSA documented by at least 2 consecutive measurements obtained more than 1 month apart - PSA at least 4 ng/mL - Testosterone no greater than 50 ng/mL - If no prior orchiectomy, must maintain castrate levels of testosterone - Disease must be refractory to standard therapy or for which no curative therapy exists - No active CNS or epidural tumors - Hormone receptor status: - Not specified NOTE: A new classification scheme for adult non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ.
