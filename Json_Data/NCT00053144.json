{"brief_title": "Irinotecan and Cytarabine in Treating Patients With Refractory or Recurrent Acute Myeloid Leukemia or Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining irinotecan with cytarabine in treating patients who have refractory or recurrent acute myeloid leukemia or chronic myelogenous leukemia.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the activity of irinotecan and cytarabine in patients with refractory or recurrent acute myeloid leukemia or chronic myelogenous leukemia in myeloid blast transformation. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of irinotecan in this regimen in these patients. - Correlate the clinical activity of this drug with cellular endpoints associated with DNA synthesis inhibition, DNA repair, induction of apoptosis, and drug resistance in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of irinotecan. Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes and cytarabine IV over 60 minutes on days 1-6. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. An additional 9 patients with refractory/relapsed acute myeloid leukemia and 9 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia in myeloid blast transformation are treated at the MTD. Patients are followed for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-36 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.5 years.", "condition": ["Leukemia"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["cytarabine", "irinotecan hydrochloride"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed acute myeloid leukemia (M0-M7) - De novo or secondary disease - Previously treated and refractory to prior therapy (which has included high-dose cytarabine and an anthracycline) - Antecedent hematologic disorders allowed OR - Histologically confirmed Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia in myeloid blast transformation - Treated or untreated - Blast transformation defined by at least 20% blasts in marrow and/or blood - Myeloid lineage defined by immunophenotyping PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - 15 and over Performance status - 0-3 Life expectancy - At least 4 weeks Hematopoietic - See Disease Characteristics Hepatic - Bilirubin less than 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) - SGOT less than 2 times ULN Renal - Creatinine less than 1.5 times ULN Other - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - No other concurrent serious medical or psychiatric illness that would preclude study consent PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - Not specified Chemotherapy - See Disease Characteristics - Prior chemotherapy for an antecedent malignancy or other medical condition allowed Endocrine therapy - Not specified Radiotherapy - Prior radiotherapy for an antecedent malignancy or other medical condition allowed Surgery - Not specified", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "15 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "adult acute promyelocytic leukemia (M3)", "mesh_term": ["Leukemia", "Leukemia, Myeloid", "Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute", "Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive", "Irinotecan", "Camptothecin", "Cytarabine"], "id": "NCT00053144"}
