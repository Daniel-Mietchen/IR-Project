{"brief_title": "Celecoxib in Preventing Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in Tobacco Smokers", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the development of cancer. Celecoxib may be effective in preventing lung cancer in tobacco smokers. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of celecoxib in preventing non-small cell lung cancer in tobacco smokers.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy and feasibility of celecoxib for chemoprevention of primary non-small cell lung cancer in high-risk tobacco smokers. - Determine the safety and long-term side effects of this drug in this population. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily for 6 months. Patients are followed at 2 weeks and then at 6 months.
