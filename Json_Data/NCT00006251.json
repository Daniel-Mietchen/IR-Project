{"brief_title": "Fludarabine Phosphate, Low-Dose Total-Body Irradiation, and Donor Stem Cell Transplant Followed by Cyclosporine, Mycophenolate Mofetil, Donor Lymphocyte Infusion in Treating Patients With Hematopoietic Cancer", "brief_summary": "This clinical trial studies fludarabine phosphate, low-dose total-body irradiation, and donor stem cell transplant followed by cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and donor lymphocyte infusion in treating patients with hematopoietic cancer. Giving low doses of chemotherapy, such as fludarabine phosphate, and total body irradiation (TBI) before a donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also keep the patient's immune response from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Giving an infusion of the donor's T cells (donor lymphocyte infusion) after the transplant may help increase this effect. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil after the transplant may stop this from happening.", "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the risk of graft rejection associated with the addition of fludarabine (fludarabine phosphate) to a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen for patients with malignant diseases treatable by allogeneic stem cell transplantation and compare this rate to that observed among patients previously treated without fludarabine. II. To estimate the rate of grade acute II/IV graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) and chronic GVHD in patients treated with low-dose total-body irradiation (TBI), fludarabine, peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) infusion and immunosuppression with cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil. OUTLINE: CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) on days - 4 to -2 and undergo low-dose TBI on day 0. (Note: Patients who have had an autologous transplant within 90 days prior to day 0 will not receive fludarabine phosphate.) PBSC INFUSION: Patients undergo allogeneic PBSC transplant on day 0. IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive cyclosporine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -3 to 35 with a taper to day 56. Patients receive mycophenolate mofetil PO BID on days 0-27. POST TRANSPLANT DONOR LYMPHOCYTE INFUSION (DLI): Patients with stable mixed chimerism on day 56, and without evidence of GVHD, undergo DLI IV over 30 minutes on day 65. Patients without a complete response, full donor chimerism, and GVHD after 2 months undergo further DLI at higher cell numbers. Up to 6 DLIs may be given 65 days apart. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months and then annually thereafter.", "condition": ["Acute Undifferentiated Leukemia", "Adult Nasal Type Extranodal NK/T-cell Lymphoma", "Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma", "Angioimmunoblastic T-cell Lymphoma", "Childhood Burkitt Lymphoma", "Childhood Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma", "Childhood Grade III Lymphomatoid Granulomatosis", "Childhood Immunoblastic Large Cell Lymphoma", "Childhood Myelodysplastic Syndromes", "Childhood Nasal Type Extranodal NK/T-cell Lymphoma", "Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia", "Cutaneous B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma", "de Novo Myelodysplastic Syndromes", "Extranodal Marginal Zone B-cell Lymphoma of Mucosa-associated Lymphoid Tissue", "Hepatosplenic T-cell Lymphoma", "Intraocular Lymphoma", "Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia", "Mast Cell Leukemia", "Myelodysplastic/Myeloproliferative Neoplasm, Unclassifiable", "Myeloid/NK-cell Acute Leukemia", "Nodal Marginal Zone B-cell Lymphoma", "Noncutaneous Extranodal Lymphoma", "Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma", "Post-transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder", "Previously Treated Myelodysplastic Syndromes", "Primary Systemic Amyloidosis", "Recurrent Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia", "Recurrent Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia", "Recurrent Adult Burkitt Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Diffuse Mixed Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Diffuse Small Cleaved Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Grade III Lymphomatoid Granulomatosis", "Recurrent Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Immunoblastic Large Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Lymphoblastic Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma", "Recurrent Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia", "Recurrent Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia", "Recurrent Childhood Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Childhood Grade III Lymphomatoid Granulomatosis", "Recurrent Childhood Large Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Childhood Lymphoblastic Lymphoma", "Recurrent Childhood Small Noncleaved Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Cutaneous T-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Recurrent Grade 1 Follicular Lymphoma", "Recurrent Grade 2 Follicular Lymphoma", "Recurrent Grade 3 Follicular Lymphoma", "Recurrent Mantle Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Marginal Zone Lymphoma", "Recurrent Mycosis Fungoides/Sezary Syndrome", "Recurrent Renal Cell Cancer", "Recurrent Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma", "Recurrent/Refractory Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia", "Refractory Hairy Cell Leukemia", "Refractory Multiple Myeloma", "Small Intestine Lymphoma", "Splenic Marginal Zone Lymphoma", "Stage II Multiple Myeloma", "Stage III Multiple Myeloma", "T-cell Large Granular Lymphocyte Leukemia", "Testicular Lymphoma", "Waldenstr\u00f6m Macroglobulinemia"], "intervention_type": ["Radiation", "Drug", "Drug", "Drug", "Procedure", "Biological", "Procedure", "Other"], "intervention_name": ["total-body irradiation", "fludarabine phosphate", "cyclosporine", "mycophenolate mofetil", "nonmyeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation", "donor lymphocytes", "peripheral blood stem cell transplantation", "laboratory biomarker analysis"], "description": ["Undergo TBI", "Given IV", "Given PO", "Given PO", "Undergo allogeneic PBSC transplant", "Undergo DLI", "Undergo allogeneic PBSC transplant", "Correlative studies"], "arm_group_label": ["Treatment (fludarabine phosphate, TBI, PBSC transplant, DLI)", "Treatment (fludarabine phosphate, TBI, PBSC transplant, DLI)", "Treatment (fludarabine phosphate, TBI, PBSC transplant, DLI)", "Treatment (fludarabine phosphate, TBI, PBSC transplant, DLI)", "Treatment (fludarabine phosphate, TBI, PBSC transplant, DLI)", "Treatment (fludarabine phosphate, TBI, PBSC transplant, DLI)", "Treatment (fludarabine phosphate, TBI, PBSC transplant, DLI)", "Treatment (fludarabine phosphate, TBI, PBSC transplant, DLI)"], "other_name": ["TBI", "2-F-ara-AMP", "Beneflur", "Fludara", "ciclosporin", "cyclosporin", "cyclosporin A", "CYSP", "Sandimmune", "Cellcept", "MMF", "PBPC transplantation", "PBSC transplantation", "peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation", "transplantation, peripheral blood stem cell"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Patients aged > 49 years and < 75 years with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and multiple myeloma who are not eligible for a curative autologous transplantation or who have failed prior autologous transplantation;
