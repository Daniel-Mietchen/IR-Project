Concurrent Treatment: Allowed: - Radiation therapy for mucocutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma. Patients must be oriented to person, place, and time and able to give written informed consent. - Patients must have had an acute episode of cryptococcal meningitis that was documented by recovery and identification of cryptococcus from lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture within 4 months of study entry. - Adequate therapy will consist of 6 - 16 weeks of treatment with amphotericin B alone, amphotericin B + oral flucytosine, or a period of the combination followed by amphotericin alone. Adequate regimens will include: - A minimum total amphotericin B dose of 2 grams as monotherapy. - 6 weeks of flucytosine at 150 mg/kg/day (or levels of 20 to 100 mcg/ml demonstrated) plus amphotericin B at an average daily dose of at least 0.3 mg/kg/day or to a total dose of 1 gram. - After a shorter period of the combination amphotericin/flucytosine therapy, an additional Y grams of amphotericin B monotherapy will make therapy adequate where Y = 2 gm-(X weeks combination therapy / 3 weeks). - For example, a patient who received 3 weeks of combination followed by amphotericin alone would need an additional 2 gm - 3 weeks/3 weeks = 1 gm of amphotericin B. - Patients need not be receiving amphotericin B at the time of randomization but must begin study maintenance therapy within 3 weeks of cessation of primary amphotericin B therapy. Prior Medication: Allowed: - Antiviral therapy (e.g., zidovudine (AZT)). - Prophylaxis (including aerosolized pentamidine) for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP). Exclusion Criteria Co-existing Condition: Patients with the following are excluded: - Clinical evidence of acute or chronic meningitis based upon any etiology other than cryptococcosis. - History of allergy or intolerance of imidazoles, azoles, or amphotericin B. - Moderate or severe liver disease. Concurrent Medication: Excluded: - Intrathecal amphotericin B. - Coumarin-type anticoagulants. - Oral hypoglycemics. - Barbiturates. - Phenytoin. - Immunostimulants. - Investigational drugs or approved (licensed) drugs for investigational indications. Concurrent Treatment: Excluded: - Lymphocyte replacement. Patients with the following are excluded: - Clinical evidence of acute or chronic meningitis based upon any etiology other than cryptococcosis. - History of allergy or intolerance of imidazoles, azoles, or amphotericin B. - Moderate or severe liver disease defined by specific lab values. - Inability to take oral medications reliably. Prior Medication: Excluded: - Intrathecal amphotericin B. - Coumarin-type anticoagulants. - Oral hypoglycemics. - Barbiturates. - Phenytoin. - Immunostimulants. - Investigational drugs or approved (licensed) drugs for investigational indications.
