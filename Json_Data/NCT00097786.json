{"brief_title": "Long-term Study of Nateglinide+Valsartan to Prevent or Delay Type II Diabetes Mellitus and Cardiovascular Complications", "brief_summary": "This study is a test of the safety and effectiveness of two drugs, one for diabetes and one for hypertension, in keeping patients with high lab values of glucose from progressing to frank diabetes and developing cardiovascular complications. People in this study cannot have frank diabetes but are considered \"borderline\" based on blood tests. People in the study take none, one or both of the drugs and do not know which one(s) they are taking.", "condition": "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Valsartan placebo + nateglinide placebo", "description": "The double-blinding of the randomized study medication was maintained by the use of identical placebo and active tablets and capsules for nateglinide and valsartan, respectively. Patients were instructed not to take the morning dose of either medication nor to eat breakfast on the day of a scheduled study visit, but to wait until after the visit was completed. Patients not tolerating the higher dose (Level 2) were down-titrated to receive Level 1. Patients not tolerating the lower dose (Level 1) had a treatment interruption. Starting at Week 2 and throughout the study, attempts were to be made to reach the highest dose level (Level 2), if medically acceptable. Following each change in dose level or re-initiation of treatment, tolerability was assessed after 2 weeks of exposure.", "arm_group_label": "Placebo", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Adults - Impaired glucose tolerance - Age dependent risk factors Exclusion Criteria: - Frank diabetes For detailed information, call contact person.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "50 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00097786.xml"}
