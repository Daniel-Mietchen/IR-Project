{"brief_title": "Oblimersen and Gemcitabine in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor or Lymphoma", "brief_summary": "Drugs used in chemotherapy such as gemcitabine use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Oblimersen may increase the effectiveness of gemcitabine by making cancer cells more sensitive to the drug. This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of oblimersen and gemcitabine in treating patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors or lymphoma", "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of oblimersen and gemcitabine in patients with advanced solid tumor or lymphoma. II. Determine the effect of oblimersen on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of gemcitabine in these patients. III. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive oblimersen IV continuously on days 1-5 and gemcitabine IV over 2-3 hours on day 5. Courses repeat every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of oblimersen and gemcitabine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Up to 10 additional patients receive treatment at the MTD. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 15 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-8 months.", "condition": ["Extranodal Marginal Zone B-cell Lymphoma of Mucosa-associated Lymphoid Tissue", "Nodal Marginal Zone B-cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Burkitt Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Diffuse Mixed Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Diffuse Small Cleaved Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Immunoblastic Large Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Lymphoblastic Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma", "Recurrent Cutaneous T-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Recurrent Grade 1 Follicular Lymphoma", "Recurrent Grade 2 Follicular Lymphoma", "Recurrent Grade 3 Follicular Lymphoma", "Recurrent Mantle Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Marginal Zone Lymphoma", "Recurrent Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma", "Splenic Marginal Zone Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Burkitt Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Diffuse Mixed Cell Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Diffuse Small Cleaved Cell Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Immunoblastic Large Cell Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Lymphoblastic Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma", "Stage IV Cutaneous T-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Stage IV Grade 1 Follicular Lymphoma", "Stage IV Grade 2 Follicular Lymphoma", "Stage IV Grade 3 Follicular Lymphoma", "Stage IV Mantle Cell Lymphoma", "Stage IV Marginal Zone Lymphoma", "Stage IV Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma", "Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific"], "intervention_type": ["Biological", "Drug", "Other", "Other"], "intervention_name": ["oblimersen sodium", "gemcitabine hydrochloride", "pharmacological study", "laboratory biomarker analysis"], "description": ["Given IV", "Given IV", "Correlative studies", "Correlative studies"], "arm_group_label": ["Treatment (oblimersen sodium and gemcitabine hydrochloride)", "Treatment (oblimersen sodium and gemcitabine hydrochloride)", "Treatment (oblimersen sodium and gemcitabine hydrochloride)", "Treatment (oblimersen sodium and gemcitabine hydrochloride)"], "other_name": ["augmerosen", "G3139", "G3139 bcl-2 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide", "Genasense", "dFdC", "difluorodeoxycytidine hydrochloride", "gemcitabine", "Gemzar", "pharmacological studies"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: -
