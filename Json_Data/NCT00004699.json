{"brief_title": "Dose Ranging Study of Recombinant Human Insulin-like Growth Factor I in Children With Hyperinsulinism", "brief_summary": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the dose of recombinant human insulin-like growth factor I that minimizes or decreases the need for exogenous glucose support without causing hypoglycemia.", "detailed_description": "PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive an escalating dose of recombinant human insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). IGF-I is given subcutaneously twice a day. The dose of IGF-I is increased each day for 4 days. Glucose is administered intravenously, when necessary, to prevent hypoglycemia. Following the study treatment patients resume prior medication and may undergo surgery.
