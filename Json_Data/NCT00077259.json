{"brief_title": "Epothilone D as Second-Line Treatment for Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Refractory Colorectal Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as epothilone D work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well epothilone D works as second-line therapy in treating patients with advanced or metastatic refractory colorectal cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the antitumor activity of epothilone D as second-line treatment, in terms of objective response rate, in patients with advanced or metastatic refractory colorectal cancer. Secondary - Determine the safety of this drug in these patients. - Determine the response duration in patients responding to treatment with this drug. - Determine time to tumor progression and overall survival in patients treated with this drug. - Correlate efficacy and safety with plasma concentrations of this drug and its major metabolites in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients receive epothilone D IV over 90 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-69 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": "Colorectal Cancer", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "epothilone D", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum - Evidence of at least 1 site of unidimensionally measurable disease by radiography or physical examination - Failed 1 prior treatment with a fluoropyrimidine in combination with either irinotecan OR oxaliplatin for advanced or metastatic disease - No known CNS metastases PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - 18 and over Performance status - ECOG 0-1 Life expectancy - Not specified Hematopoietic - Hemoglobin \u2265 9 g/dL - Absolute neutrophil count \u2265 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count \u2265 100,000/mm^3 Hepatic - Bilirubin \u2264 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) - AST and ALT \u2264 2.5 times ULN (5 times ULN if hepatic metastases are present) - Alkaline phosphatase \u2264 5 times ULN Renal - Creatinine \u2264 1.5 times ULN Cardiovascular - No New York Heart Association class III or IV congestive heart failure - No QTc > 450 msec for males or > 470 msec for females - No personal or family history of congenital long QT syndrome Other - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective barrier contraception - No pre-existing neuropathy grade 2 or greater - No documented grade 3 or 4 hypersensitivity reaction to prior therapy containing Cremophor - No infection requiring parenteral or oral anti-infective treatment - No altered mental status or psychiatric condition that would preclude giving informed consent - No other medical condition that would preclude study participation - No other malignancy within the past 5 years except cured basal cell skin cancer, carcinoma in situ of the cervix or bladder, or stage T1 or T2 prostate cancer with a prostate-specific antigen < 2 ng/mL PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - No concurrent sargramostim (GM-CSF) - No concurrent routine prophylactic use of filgrastim (G-CSF) Chemotherapy - See Disease Characteristics - At least 3 weeks since prior chemotherapy and recovered Endocrine therapy - Not specified Radiotherapy - At least 3 weeks since prior radiotherapy and recovered Surgery - At least 3 weeks since prior surgery and recovered Other - More than 3 weeks since prior investigational agents (therapeutic or diagnostic) - No other concurrent therapy for advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer - No other concurrent investigational drugs", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00077259.xml"}
