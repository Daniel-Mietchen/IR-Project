{"brief_title": "Robotic Upper-Limb Neurorehabilitation in Chronic Stroke Patient", "brief_summary": "We have established the feasibility and effectiveness of robot-aided rehabilitation in stroke patients using a robot for neurological rehabilitation designed and built by MIT. Results of a pilot study of 20 patients were promising and showed that robot therapy is safe, tolerated by patients and produces a significant, measurable benefit. We propose to test that the robotic upper extremity trainer is an acceptable cost effective adjunct to standard occupational therapy for patients with dysfunction of the shoulder and elbow due to hemiparetic stroke in a VA rehabilitation program.", "condition": "Stroke", "intervention_type": "Other", "intervention_name": "Traditional Supervised Upper Extremity Exercises", "description": "Arm ergometer, reaching, and stretching exercises", "arm_group_label": "2", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Chronic Stroke - Manual Muscle Score of Grade 3 or lower in at least one muscle of the affected arm Exclusion Criteria: - Acute Stroke - Contracture or orthopedic problems limiting the movement of the affected arm - Visual deficit such that the participant cannot see the test pattern on the robot trainer - Serious complicating medical illness - Botox treatment to the involved arm within three months of enrollment", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00037934.xml"}
