{"brief_title": "Raloxifene in Treating Patients With Persistent or Recurrent Endometrial Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Estrogen can stimulate the growth of endometrial cancer cells. Hormone therapy using raloxifene may fight endometrial cancer by reducing the production of estrogen. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of raloxifene in treating patients who have persistent or recurrent endometrial cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine response rate and time to disease progression in patients with recurrent endometrial cancer treated with raloxifene. II. Determine overall survival in these patients treated with this regimen. III. Determine the toxicity of raloxifene in this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral raloxifene daily. Treatment continues indefinitely in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 13-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.5 years.", "condition": ["Endometrial Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["raloxifene"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Recurrent endometrial cancer Evidence of persistent or recurrent disease 4 weeks following primary treatment with radiation and surgery Bidimensionally measurable disease Not a candidate for curative salvage radiotherapy PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: 18 and over Performance status: ECOG 0-3 Life expectancy: Not specified Hematopoietic: Not specified Hepatic: Not specified Renal: Not specified Cardiovascular: No history of unexplained or uncontrolled thromboembolic disease No active thromboembolic disease Other: No active or uncontrolled second malignancy HIV negative PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: Not specified Chemotherapy: At least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy for early stage or advanced endometrial cancer Endocrine therapy: At least 4 weeks since prior hormonal therapy for early stage or advanced endometrial cancer Radiotherapy: See Disease Characteristics Surgery: See Disease Characteristics", "gender": "Female", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "recurrent endometrial carcinoma", "mesh_term": ["Endometrial Neoplasms", "Raloxifene Hydrochloride"], "id": "NCT00004915"}
