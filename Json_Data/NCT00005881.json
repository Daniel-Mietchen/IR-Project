{"brief_title": "Quality of Life in Children Treated for Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Questionnaires that measure quality of life may improve the ability to plan treatment for children with cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying the quality of life in children treated for cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the validity and reliability of a quality of life questionnaire (MM-QOL) that is being developed for patients with previously or currently treated childhood cancers. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age (8-12 vs 13-20) and treatment (current vs previous). Patients are randomized to one of two arms of the study. Arm I (Reliability): Patients will complete the same questionnaire two weeks apart. (age 13-20 stratum closed as of 7/14/00) Arm II (Validity): Patients will complete a study questionnaire plus a Child Health Questionnaire. Patients between ages 8-12 are interviewed and patients between ages 13-20 complete a written questionnaire. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 716 patients (416 for arm I (208 for 8-12 age group and 208 for 13-20 age group) and 300 for arm II (150 for 8-12 age group and 150 for 13-20 age group)) will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Leukemia", "Lymphoma", "Unspecified Childhood Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific"], "intervention_type": ["Other"], "intervention_name": ["Quality of Life Forms"], "description": ["Completion of the instrument [Minneapolis-Manchester Quality of Life (MM-QOL)] that measures HRQOL in the survivors of childhood cancer in a standardized, valid way and to assess the feasibility of incorporating this endpoint in a variety of clinical trials."], "arm_group_label": ["Quality of life forms"], "study_pop": "\n      ", "sampling_method": "Probability Sample", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Prior or current diagnosis of any pediatric cancer Current chemoradiotherapy (at least 2 months since start of therapy) OR At least 1 year since prior treatment and in remission PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: 8 to 20 Performance status: Not specified Life expectancy: Not specified Hematopoietic: Not specified Hepatic: Not specified Renal: Not specified PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: Not specified Chemotherapy: See Disease Characteristics Endocrine therapy: Not specified Radiotherapy: See Disease Characteristics Surgery: Not specified", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "8 Years", "maximum_age": "20 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "recurrent childhood large cell lymphoma", "mesh_term": ["Lymphoma", "Leukemia"], "id": "NCT00005881"}
