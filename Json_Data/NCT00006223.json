{"brief_title": "flt3L in Treating Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs such as flt3L may stimulate a person's immune system and help kill cancer cells. It is not yet known if flt3L is effective in treating acute myeloid leukemia. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of flt3L in treating patients who have acute myeloid leukemia that is in remission.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Compare the failure-free survival and overall survival in patients with acute myeloid leukemia in complete remission treated with maintenance flt3 ligand vs observation alone. - Compare the long-term immunologic effects of these regimens in these patients. - Compare the long-term safety and toxicity of these regimens in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to complete remission (CR) (first vs second vs third or subsequent) and post-remission therapy (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive flt3 ligand subcutaneously daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Arm II: Patients undergo observation alone. Patients begin treatment or observation within 4 weeks after documentation of CR after induction therapy or within 4 weeks after discharge from hospital after post-remission therapy. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 139 patients will be accrued for this study within approximately 28 months.", "condition": "Leukemia", "intervention_type": "Biological", "intervention_name": "recombinant flt3 ligand", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia in first, second, third, or subsequent complete remission (CR) - Must be at least 60 years of age if first CR - Must have had histological proof (from bone marrow aspirate, smears, or touch preps of marrow biopsy) of one of the following prior to achieving CR: - Acute myeloblastic leukemia (M0, M1, M2) - Acute promyelocytic leukemia (M3) - Acute myelomonocytic leukemia (M4) - Acute monocytic leukemia (M5) - Acute erythroleukemia (M6) - Acute megakaryocytic leukemia (M7) - Refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 and over Performance status: - ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - Not specified Hepatic: - Bilirubin less than 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) - SGOT less than 3 times ULN Renal: - Creatinine less than 2 mg/dL Cardiovascular: - No clinically significant active cardiac disease Pulmonary: - No clinically significant active pulmonary disease Other: - Not pregnant or nursing - Fertile patients must use effective contraception - No uncontrolled or active autoimmune disease PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - Prior autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) allowed - No prior allogeneic BMT - Other prior immunotherapy allowed if not received during the most recent treatment Chemotherapy: - Not specified Endocrine therapy: - Not specified Radiotherapy: - Not specified Surgery: - Not specified", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00006223.xml"}
