{"brief_title": "Antihyperlipidemic Effects of Oyster Mushrooms", "brief_summary": "The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the short-term safety and potential efficacy of oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus ostreatus) for treatment of hyperlipidemia in HIV-infected patients who are taking Kaletra, a protease inhibitor (PI) that is commonly used in highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).", "detailed_description": "This is a single-arm, open-label, 8-week \"proof of concept\" pilot study in 20 subjects to determine if there are detectable lipid-lowering effects of oyster mushrooms in patients with HIV and hyperlipidemia who are taking Kaletra (a ritonavir-containing HAART regimen). The study will also assess whether the concurrent administration of oyster mushrooms and such regimens is safe, and investigate the mechanism of action whereby oyster mushrooms may exert their antihyperlipidemic effect.", "condition": ["HIV Infections", "Hyperlipidemia"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["oyster mushroom"], "criteria": "Inclusion criteria: - Documented HIV infection (positive ELISA and Western Blot or measurable plasma HIV RNA). - Taking Kaletra (ritonavir/lopinavir), a ritonavir-containing antiretroviral therapy, for at least 12 weeks - Elevated non-HDL cholesterol >= 160 mg/dl as defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines (within 30 days of enrollment) - AST or ALT <2.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) within 30 days of study entry.
