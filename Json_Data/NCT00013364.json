{"brief_title": "Effects of Stimulus Validity on Speech Recognition", "brief_summary": "The effects of talker variability will be investigated with four groups of listeners (young normal-hearing; old normal-hearing; young hearing-impaired; old hearing-impaired). Experimental conditions will include between-talker differences, speaking rate, lexical difficult and semantic/linguistic context. A preliminary experiment will evaluate the relative merit of adaptive vs fixed-level methods of stimulus presentation.", "condition": "Hearing Impaired", "intervention_type": "Behavioral", "intervention_name": "Talker variability", "criteria": "Hearing impaired", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "85 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00013364.xml"}
