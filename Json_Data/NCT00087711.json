{"brief_title": "A Randomized Phase 3 Trial of Pemetrexed and Cisplatin Versus Gemcitabine and Cisplatin in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer", "brief_summary": "This study is a randomized Phase 3 study comparing pemetrexed and cisplatin combination to gemcitabine and cisplatin for the treatment of Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NCSLC). Gemcitabine plus cisplatin is currently the standard of care for NSCLC. It is thought that pemetrexed plus cisplatin may be as effective and may have fewer side effects than the standard of care.", "condition": ["Non Small Cell Lung Carcinoma"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["pemetrexed", "gemcitabine", "cisplatin"], "description": ["500 mg/m2, IV q 21 days x 6 cycles", "1250 mg/m2, IV, day 1 and 8 q 21 days x 6 cycles", "75 mg/m2, IV, q 21 days x 6 cycles"], "arm_group_label": ["A", "B", "A", "B"], "other_name": ["LY231514", "Alimta", "LY188011", "Gemzar"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Diagnosis of NSCLC Stage IIIB not amenable to curative treatment or Stage IV. - No prior chemotherapy for lung cancer. - Patients must have at least one uni-dimensionally measurable lesion. - Prior radiation therapy to less than 25% of bone marrow, whole pelvis not allowed.
