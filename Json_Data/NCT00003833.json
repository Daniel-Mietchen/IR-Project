{"brief_title": "Genetic Study in Patients With Stage II or Stage III Colon Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Genetic studies may help in understanding the genetic processes that cause some types of cancer. PURPOSE: Genetic trial to study certain genes of patients who have stage II or stage III colon cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the adverse prognostic significance of 8p allelic imbalance (AI) in patients with colon cancer. - Determine if patient prognosis is dependent on the region of 8p AI. - Perform fine mapping studies to further localize the putative tumor suppressor gene(s) on 8p. - Perform multicolor FISH to examine the role that 8p loss and 8q gain play in the prognosis of patients whose tumors exhibit 8p AI. OUTLINE: Matched normal and tumor DNA is analyzed for 8p allelic imbalance with at least 8 markers: D8S262 and D8S1825 localized to 8p23, D8S254 and D8S261 at 8p22, D8S560 and D8S136 at 8p21, and D8S1820 and D8S283 at 8p12. Normal/tumor tissue pairs are used for fine mapping studies.", "condition": ["Colorectal Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Genetic", "Genetic"], "intervention_name": ["DNA stability analysis", "gene mapping"], "arm_group_label": ["Normal and tumor tissue pairs", "Normal and tumor tissue pairs"], "study_pop": "\n      ", "sampling_method": "Non-Probability Sample", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Diagnosis of resectable stage II or III adenocarcinoma of the colon - Participated in NCCTG-914653 - DNA extracted from both normal and tumor tissue PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - Under 70", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "69 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "adenocarcinoma of the colon", "mesh_term": ["Colorectal Neoplasms"], "id": "NCT00003833"}
