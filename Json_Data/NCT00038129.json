{"brief_title": "SPRINT - Randomized Trial of Tibial Fracture Fixation", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a difference in the rate of healing of a tibia fracture treated with an intramedullary nail based on whether or not the bone was reamed prior to nail insertion.", "detailed_description": "Patients with tibia fractures that are amenable to being treated with both a reamed and an unreamed nail will be randomized via telephone to one of the two groups. These patients then will be followed for a year with clinical, as well as subjective, outcome follow-up questionnaires. Time to healing, as well as repeat interventions and adverse events, will be tracked. The rationale for doing a large sample size multi-center trial is the hope that a clear answer to whether or not one of these two methods is significantly better than the other will become apparent and thus aid surgeons in making a more informed operative treatment choice.", "condition": "Tibial Fracture", "intervention_type": "Procedure", "intervention_name": "Intramedullary nail implant", "description": "Insertion of an intramedullary nail during tibial fracture fixation with or without prior reaming of the intramedullary canal.", "arm_group_label": "2", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Fractured tibia requiring fixation using an intramedullary nail", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "16 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00038129.xml"}
