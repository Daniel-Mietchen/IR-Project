{"brief_title": "Randomized, Phase I/II, Dose-Ranging, Open-Label Trial of the Anti-HIV Activity of Delavirdine Mesylate (DLV; U-90,152S)", "brief_summary": "PRIMARY: To study the safety and tolerance of delavirdine mesylate ( U-90152 ) monotherapy. To compare the anti-HIV activity of three blood concentration levels of this agent with nucleoside analog monotherapy, either zidovudine ( AZT ) or didanosine ( ddI ), based on the reduction of HIV viral burden. SECONDARY: To use pharmacokinetic parameters to assess the relationship between daily drug exposure and antiviral activity and toxicity of the U-90152, AZT, and ddI monotherapy. To assess anti-HIV activity using other disease markers. Data suggest that bisheteroarylpiperazines (BHAPs) such as delavirdine mesylate are potent and safe anti-HIV agents and may have different biological behavior than other currently available non-nucleoside RT inhibitors.", "detailed_description": "Data suggest that bisheteroarylpiperazines (BHAPs) such as delavirdine mesylate are potent and safe anti-HIV agents and may have different biological behavior than other currently available non-nucleoside RT inhibitors. Patients are randomized to receive U-90152 at one of three doses (treatment arms I through III) or either AZT or ddI (treatment arm IV). Patients on arm IV who are AZT-naive receive AZT; those who are AZT-experienced receive ddI. Treatment continues for 24 weeks. PER 12/22/94 AMENDMENT: All patients receiving U-90152 have the same starting dose, to attain one of three target trough levels.", "condition": ["HIV Infections"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Delavirdine mesylate", "Zidovudine", "Didanosine"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria Concurrent Medication: Allowed: - PCP prophylaxis. - Topical antifungal agents, clotrimazole troches, nystatin oral suspension, topical ketoconazole, and oral fluconazole. - Acyclovir (<= 1000 mg/day) as maintenance therapy for herpes simplex virus. - Recombinant erythropoietin and G-CSF. - Antibiotics for bacterial infections, unless specifically excluded. - Symptomatic treatment such as antipyretics, analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and antiemetics. - Antacids.
