{"brief_title": "Lactobacillus Plantarum as Therapy for NK-T Cell Deficiency", "brief_summary": "The etiology of immune-mediated diabetes mellitus (IMD) remains unclear. However, previous studies indicate that autoimmunity may be a result of dysfunction of natural killer T cells (NK-T cells). Newly diagnoses patients with IMD have been shown in our laboratory to have significantly lower NK-T cells than normal controls. Other studies have shown that oral administration of lactobacillus can boost NK-T cell activity in children with HIV without side effects. Our objective is to evaluate the effect of lactobacillus administration on NK-T cell activity in patients with IMD", "condition": "Diabetes Mellitus", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Oral lactobacillus administration", "criteria": "Recently diagnosed (within the last 6 months) patients with immune-mediated (type 1) diabetes", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "1 Year", "maximum_age": "95 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00011141.xml"}
