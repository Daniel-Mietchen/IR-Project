{"brief_title": "Pixantrone, Cytarabine, Methylprednisolone, and Cisplatin in Treating Patients With Aggressive Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma in First Relapse", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as pixantrone, cytarabine, methylprednisolone, and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating patients who have relapsed aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the antitumor activity of pixantrone, cytarabine, methylprednisolone, and cisplatin in patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in first relapse. - Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the validity and safety of this regimen as a mobilization regimen before high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell support in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. - Salvage therapy: Patients receive pixantrone IV over 1 hour on day 1; cisplatin IV over 30 minutes on days 1-4; methylprednisolone IV over 15-30 minutes on days 1-5; and cytarabine IV over 2 hours on day 5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 2 courses of salvage therapy, patients are re-evaluated and treated as follows: - Complete response (CR) or partial response (PR): Patients with a CR or PR who are suitable candidates for autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) proceed to mobilization therapy, high-dose chemotherapy, and ASCT. Patients with a CR or PR who are unsuitable candidates for ASCT continue to receive salvage therapy for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Stable disease: Patients with stable disease continue to receive salvage therapy for up to 6 courses. Patients who have a CR or PR after 3-4 courses of salvage therapy and who are suitable candidates for ASCT proceed to mobilization therapy, high-dose chemotherapy, and ASCT off study at the investigator's discretion. - Mobilization therapy (optional regimen; regimen used for mobilization is at the investigator's discretion): Patients receive rituximab* IV on days 1 and 7; pixantrone IV over 1 hour on day 2; cisplatin IV over 30 minutes on days 2-5; cytarabine IV over 2 hours on day 6; and methylprednisolone IV over 15-30 minutes on days 2-6. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously once daily beginning on day 7 and continuing until blood counts recover. Patients receive 1 or more courses of mobilization therapy during which stem cells are harvested. Patients then proceed to high-dose chemotherapy and subsequent re-infusion of harvested stem cells. NOTE: *If this mobilization regimen is used, patients with T-cell lymphoma do not receive rituximab - High-dose chemotherapy and ASCT: Patients receive high-dose chemotherapy and ASCT per institutional standard practice. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years.
