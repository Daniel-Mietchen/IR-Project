{"brief_title": "Music Imagery for Patients Receiving Chemotherapy for Leukemia or Non-Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to explore the effect of music imagery on patients receiving intensive chemotherapy for acute leukemia or high-grade non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma.", "detailed_description": "Standard treatment for acute leukemia and high-grade non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma includes intensive chemotherapy that typically requires a 4-week hospital stay in protective isolation. Patients treated in isolation units may experience elevated levels of psychological distress. Both guided imagery and music therapy have been effective in improving the moods of cancer patients, but studies have not been conducted in acute leukemia and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma patients. This study will evaluate the effect of music imagery on these patients. Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive either standard care plus music imagery or standard care alone. Participants assigned to the standard care plus music imagery group will receive a 45-minute weekly music imagery session with a music therapist. All participants will complete questionnaires and self-reports regarding their general anxiety, affect, and fatigue.", "condition": "Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin", "intervention_type": "Behavioral", "intervention_name": "Music Imagery", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Admitted to Indiana University Hematologic Malignancy Program for the treatment of newly diagnosed or recurrent acute leukemia or high-grade non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma - Able to read and understand English", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "80 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00082303.xml"}
