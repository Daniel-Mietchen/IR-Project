{"brief_title": "BMS-247550 in Treating Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of BMS-247550 in treating patients who have advanced pancreatic cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the 6-month survival rate and time to treatment failure in patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with BMS-247550. - Determine the frequency and severity of toxic effects of this drug in these patients. - Determine the complete and partial response in those patients with measurable disease treated with this drug. - Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive BMS-247550 IV over 3 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and then annually until 3 years after registration. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25-55 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": "Pancreatic Cancer", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "ixabepilone", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma - Distant metastases OR - Locoregional disease that has failed or is not amenable to locoregional therapy - No de novo locoregional disease - No known brain metastases PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - Adult Performance status: - Zubrod 0-1 Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - Absolute granulocyte count at least 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 100,000/mm^3 Hepatic: - Bilirubin no greater than 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) - SGOT or SGPT no greater than 2.5 times ULN - Alkaline phosphatase less than 2.5 times ULN Renal: - Creatinine no greater than 1.5 mg/dL Cardiovascular: - No recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or life-threatening arrhythmia Other: - Not pregnant or nursing - Fertile patients must use effective contraception - No other malignancy within the past 5 years except adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or stage I or II cancer in remission - No prior severe hypersensitivity reaction to drugs containing Cremophor EL - No active or uncontrolled infection - No severe psychiatric disorders PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - No prior neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or primary immunotherapy for advanced pancreatic cancer - No concurrent anticancer immunotherapy Chemotherapy: - No prior neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or primary chemotherapy for advanced pancreatic cancer - No other concurrent anticancer chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: - No prior neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or primary hormonal therapy for advanced pancreatic cancer - No concurrent anticancer hormonal therapy Radiotherapy: - No prior neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or primary radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy for advanced pancreatic cancer - Prior palliative radiotherapy allowed if at least 1 lesion remains outside of radiation field or at least 1 lesion has progressed since radiotherapy - No concurrent anticancer radiotherapy except palliative radiotherapy to non-target metastatic sites Surgery: - At least 2 weeks since prior surgery for pancreatic cancer and recovered Other: - No other concurrent anticancer therapy - No concurrent herbal or unconventional therapy (e.g., St. John's Wort)", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00016965.xml"}
