{"brief_title": "CPG 7909 Injection in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer", "brief_summary": "Eligible patients will be randomized in a ratio of 2:1 to receive either chemotherapy (a taxane and a platinum compound) plus CPG 7909 Injection or chemotherapy alone. Protocol therapy will be administered until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. CpG 7909 Injection will be administered subcutaneously, on Weeks 2 and 3 of each three-week cycle (days 8 and 15) and chemotherapy will be administered on Week 1 (Day 1).
