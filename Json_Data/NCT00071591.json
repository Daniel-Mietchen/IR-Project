As people with schizophrenia get older, resources for effective health care and social services may become more limited. There is a need to develop effective rehabilitation programs that are sensitive to the special needs of older persons with schizophrenia. Patients are randomly assigned to either 1 of 2 groups. The FAST group will involve 24 sessions of group intervention designed to enhance daily functioning of older patients with schizophrenia. The placebo group will involve participation in a psychosocial support group for an equivalent amount of time. Treatment is followed by 6 monthly maintenance sessions. Patients will be assessed at 6, 12, and 18 months after the study start. Assessments include clinical and functional measures.", "condition": "Schizophrenia", "intervention_type": "Behavioral", "intervention_name": "Functional Adaptation Skills Training (FAST)", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Have schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "40 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00071591.xml"}
