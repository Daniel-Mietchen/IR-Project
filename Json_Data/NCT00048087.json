{"brief_title": "Iressa/Docetaxel in Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer", "brief_summary": "Patients will receive 250 mg Iressa by mouth daily each day while on this study. Patients will also receive docetaxel 30 mg/m2 by by vein (IV) on day 1 weekly for the first 3 weeks of each course of therapy. A course of therapy is 4 weeks. Patients will not receive docetaxel during week 4. A maximum of 8 full cycles of docetaxel plus Iressa are planned. Patients may continue on daily Iressa until progressive disease and/or unacceptable toxicity.", "condition": "Non-small Cell Lung Cancer", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Docetaxel", "description": "30 mg/m2 by IV on day 1 weekly for the first 3 weeks of each 4 week course.", "arm_group_label": "Iressa + Docetaxel", "other_name": "Taxotere", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Pathologically confirmed non-small cell lung cancer. - Measurable, evaluable disease outside of a radiation port. - ECOG performance status 0-2. - Adequate hematologic function as defined by an absolute neutrophil count >= 1,500/mm3, a platelet count >= 100,000/mm3, a WBC >= 3,000/ mm3, and a hemoglobin level of >= 9 g/dl. - One prior chemotherapy regimen.
