{"brief_title": "Antineoplaston Therapy in Treating Patients With Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Antineoplastons are naturally-occurring substances that may also be made in the laboratory. Antineoplastons may inhibit the growth of cancer cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well antineoplaston therapy works in treating patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that has not responded to high-dose chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety and possible effectiveness of antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who have failed high-dose chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation. - Describe the response to, tolerance to, and side effects of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients receive gradually escalating doses of intravenous antineoplaston A10 and antineoplaston AS2-1 6 times per day until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Treatment continues for at least 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 12 months, patients with responding or stable disease may continue treatment. Tumors are measured every 8 weeks for 6 months, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for years 3 and 4, and then annually for years 5 and 6. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Lymphoma"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["antineoplaston A10", "antineoplaston AS2-1"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically proven non-Hodgkin's disease that has failed both prior high-dose chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 and over Performance status: - Karnofsky 60-100% Life expectancy: - At least 2 months Hematopoietic: - WBC greater than 2,000/mm^3 - Platelet count greater than 20,000/mm^3 Hepatic: - Bilirubin no greater than 2.5 mg/dL Renal: - Creatinine no greater than 2.5 mg/dL - No history of renal conditions that contraindicate high dosages of sodium Cardiovascular: - No hypertension - No history of congestive heart failure - No history of other cardiovascular conditions that contraindicate high dosages of sodium Other: - Not pregnant or nursing - Fertile patients must use effective contraception during and for 4 weeks after study participation - No serious active infections PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - At least 4 weeks since prior immunotherapy and recovered - No concurrent immunomodulatory agents (e.g., interferon or interleukin-2) Chemotherapy: - At least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy (6 weeks for nitrosoureas) and recovered Endocrine therapy: - At least 4 weeks since prior corticosteroids - No concurrent corticosteroids Radiotherapy: - At least 8 weeks since prior radiotherapy and recovered Surgery: - Not specified Other: - No prior antineoplaston therapy - No other concurrent antineoplastic agents - No concurrent antibiotics, antifungals, or antivirals", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "splenic marginal zone lymphoma", "mesh_term": ["Lymphoma", "Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin"], "id": "NCT00003498"}
