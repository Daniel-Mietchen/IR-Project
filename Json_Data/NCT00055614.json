{"brief_title": "Topotecan in Treating Patients With Advanced Ovarian Epithelial, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of topotecan in treating patients who have advanced ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose and duration of prolonged topotecan as maintenance in patients with advanced ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer with complete clinical response after platinum-based chemotherapy. - Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive oral topotecan twice daily for 21 days. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients who tolerate course 1 may receive an escalated dose of topotecan for subsequent courses. The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the dose tolerated by the majority of the patients. Patients are followed every 2 months for at least 6 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Fallopian Tube Cancer", "Ovarian Cancer", "Primary Peritoneal Cavity Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Procedure"], "intervention_name": ["topotecan hydrochloride", "adjuvant therapy"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal serous cancer - Stage IIIB, IIIC, or IV - Surgically staged and debulked - Complete clinical response after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin) defined by all of the following criteria: - No evidence of cancer by history or physical examination - CA 125 no greater than 35 units/mL - No evidence of residual cancer on CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis and chest x-ray - Must have received at least 5 courses of first-line chemotherapy PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - 18 and over Performance status - ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy - Not specified Hematopoietic - Granulocyte count at least 1,200/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 90,000/mm^3 Hepatic - Bilirubin normal - ALT and AST less than 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) - Alkaline phosphatase less than 1.5 ULN Renal - Creatinine clearance at least 60 mL/min PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - No concurrent immunotherapy Chemotherapy - See Disease Characteristics - At least 3 weeks since prior first-line chemotherapy - At least 3 years since other prior chemotherapy (other than first-line chemotherapy for ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer) - No other concurrent chemotherapy Endocrine therapy - No concurrent hormonal therapy Radiotherapy - No prior abdominopelvic radiotherapy - No concurrent radiotherapy Surgery - See Disease Characteristics - No concurrent surgery Other - No other concurrent antitumor therapy", "gender": "Female", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "primary peritoneal cavity cancer", "mesh_term": ["Fallopian Tube Neoplasms", "Peritoneal Neoplasms", "Topotecan"], "id": "NCT00055614"}
