{"brief_title": "A Study of Dextran Sulfate in HIV-Infected Patients and in Patients With AIDS or AIDS Related Complex (ARC)", "brief_summary": "To determine the effectiveness and safety of dextran sulfate (DS) as a treatment for patients with AIDS, AIDS related complex (ARC), or asymptomatic HIV infection with or without persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL), and to determine antiviral activity at different doses of DS. Although zidovudine (AZT) has shown promise in prolonging life in patients with AIDS and severe ARC, it has significant blood toxicities. It would be beneficial to combine AZT with another antiviral agent that does not have the same toxicity. DS might be a suitable drug since it has shown antiviral activity against HIV in the laboratory, and in preliminary studies it has shown little toxicity. Also, the combination of DS with AZT has been shown to be more effective than either alone.", "detailed_description": "Although zidovudine (AZT) has shown promise in prolonging life in patients with AIDS and severe ARC, it has significant blood toxicities.

Also, the combination of DS with AZT has been shown to be more effective than either alone. The study will begin with 10 patients with AIDS, 10 with ARC, and 10 with asymptomatic HIV infection taking DS by mouth 3 times a day for 24 weeks. If the initial dose of DS is tolerated without significant side effects, the next group of patients will receive a higher dose. A third group of patients will be given either a higher or lower dose depending on the results of the earlier groups. Patients will be evaluated every other week for 12 weeks, then monthly for the remaining 16 weeks. Patients will have the option of continuing DS until the entire study is completed if the drug is well tolerated. Inhaled pentamidine for the prevention of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia is allowed, but other investigational drugs are not. Drug effects on the HIV virus, immune function, and clinical condition will be monitored during the periodic evaluations.", "condition": ["HIV Infections"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Dextran sulfate"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria Concurrent Medication: Allowed: - Aerosolized pentamidine for prophylaxis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP). - Acetaminophen. - Ketoconazole.
