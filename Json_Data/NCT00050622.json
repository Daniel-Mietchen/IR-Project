{"brief_title": "Behavioral Treatment, Drug Treatment, and Combined Treatment for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of behavioral treatment, drug treatment, and combined treatment for children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). This study will also examine the interactions between different levels of behavioral and drug treatments.", "detailed_description": "Participants attend a summer treatment program each Monday-Friday for 9 weeks. They participate in group recreational and classroom activities, with 12 children and 5 staff per group. Three behavioral conditions (no behavioral modification, low-intensity behavioral modification, and high-intensity behavioral modification) are delivered in random order, with each condition lasting 3 weeks. Along with the behavioral treatment conditions, children receive 1 of 4 medication doses (placebo, 0.15 mg/kg methylphenidate, 0.3 mg/kg methylphenidate, or 0.6 mg/kg methylphenidate) in random order, with each dose varied daily and repeated 3 or 4 times within each behavioral treatment condition. Measures include frequency counts of positive and negative behaviors, academic productivity and accuracy in the classroom, and counselor, parent, and teacher ratings of benefits and side effects. Parents attend training sessions and implement behavioral programs at home.", "condition": ["Attention Deficit Disorder With Hyperactivity"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Behavioral", "Drug", "Drug", "Drug", "Behavioral"], "intervention_name": ["Methylphenidate 0.15 mg/kg", "Low-Intensity BMOD", "Methylphenidate 0.3 mg/kg", "Placebo", "Methylphenidate 0.6 mg/kg", "High Intensity BMOD"], "description": ["0.15 m/kg/dose immediate-release methylphenidate", "Lower-intensity behavioral treatment package.", "0.3 mg/kg/dose immediate-release methylphenidate", "0.3 mg/kg/dose immediate-release methylphenidate", "Comprehensive high-intensity Summer Treatment Program (STP)"], "arm_group_label": ["Low Dose Medication Only", "Low Intensity BMOD + Low Dose Medication", "High Intensity BMOD + Low Dose Medication", "Low Intensity BMOD Only", "Low Intensity BMOD + Low Dose Medication", "Low Intensity BMOD + Medium Dose Medication", "Low Intensity BMOD + Higher Dose Medication", "Medium Dose Medication Only", "Low Intensity BMOD + Medium Dose Medication", "High Intensity BMOD + Medium Dose Medication", "No Treatment", "Low Intensity BMOD Only", "Higher Dose Medication Only", "Low Intensity BMOD + Higher Dose Medication", "High Intensity BMOD + Higher Dose Medication", "High Intensity BMOD Only", "High Intensity BMOD + Low Dose Medication", "High Intensity BMOD + Medium Dose Medication", "High Intensity BMOD + Higher Dose Medication"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder - IQ >= 80 Exclusion Criteria: - History of seizures or other neurological problems - Medical history that would involve considerable risk in taking stimulant medication - History or concurrent diagnosis of any of the following disorders: pervasive developmental disorder, schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders, sexual disorder, organic mental disorder, or eating disorder", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "5 Years", "maximum_age": "12 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "mesh_term": ["Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity", "Hyperkinesis", "Methylphenidate"], "id": "NCT00050622"}
