{"brief_title": "Screening for Inherited Heart Disease", "brief_summary": "Genetically inherited heart diseases like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are conditions affecting the heart passed on to family members by abnormalities in genetic information. These conditions are responsible for many heart related deaths and illnesses. Presently, there are several research studies being conducted in order to improve the understanding of disease processes and symptoms associated with genetically inherited heart diseases. This study is designed to determine the eligibility of patients diagnosed with or suspected to have inherited heart disease to participate in these research studies.", "detailed_description": "Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and other inherited cardiac diseases are being studied under several research protocols to determine their pathogenesis and clinical manifestations. The purpose of this protocol is to determine the eligibility of patients with known or suspected inherited heart conditions for our research protocols.", "condition": ["Heart Disease", "Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy"], "criteria": "INCLUSION CRITERIA Subjects and family members known or suspected to have inherited a cardiac disease such as HCM.
