{"brief_title": "Phase III Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study of Intravenous Immune Globulin for Multiple Sclerosis", "brief_summary": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether high-dose intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) is more effective than placebo in restoring neurologic function (muscle strength) in patients with multiple sclerosis. II. Determine the time to recovery following IVIG.", "detailed_description": "PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind study. Patients are treated with intravenous immune globulin or placebo. In the absence of a hypersensitivity reaction to a test dose, a total of 11 doses is administered: daily for 5 days, then every 2 weeks for 12 weeks. Patients are followed at 3 months.", "condition": ["Multiple Sclerosis"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["immune globulin"], "criteria": "PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA: --Disease Characteristics-- - Clinically or laboratory-supported definite multiple sclerosis - Disease relapsing-remitting or relapsing-progressive (i.e., secondary- progressive) - Targeted neurologic deficit as follows: 25% or more loss of power in at least 1 limb Severity -1 or greater on Mayo Clinic rating scale OR Between 3+/5 and 4-/5 on Medical Research Clinic muscle power scale - Documented by Mayo Clinic Department of Neurology as neither progressing nor improving for 4 to 18 months prior to entry No clinical evidence of spontaneous or corticosteroid-induced improvement - Able to cooperate with isometric strength testing requirements --Prior/Concurrent Therapy-- - No concurrent experimental drug therapy - No concurrent intravenous immune globulin At least 3 months since immunosuppressive therapy, e.g., corticosteroids and corticotropin - At least 3 months since plasma exchange --Patient Characteristics-- - Hepatic: No coagulation defect, e.g., hyperviscosity syndrome - Renal: Creatinine no greater than 1.5 times normal - Cardiovascular: No unstable or advanced ischemic or cerebrovascular disease, e.g.: angina congestive heart failure transient ischemic attack stroke - Immunologic: No human gamma globulin or albumin sensitivity No hypergammaglobulinemia No known antibody deficiency syndrome, especially IgA deficiency Other: - No condition interfering with neurologic exam, e.g.: - Major amputation - Deforming arthritis - Major psychiatric illness - Superimposed lower motor neuron deficit - No intellectual impairment precluding study participation - No pregnant or nursing women - Adequate contraception required of fertile patients", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "60 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "rare disease", "mesh_term": ["Sclerosis", "Multiple Sclerosis", "Immunoglobulins, Intravenous", "gamma-Globulins", "Rho(D) Immune Globulin", "Immunoglobulins", "Antibodies"], "id": "NCT00004744"}
