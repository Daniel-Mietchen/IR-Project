{"brief_title": "Doxorubicin and Gemcitabine in Treating Patients With Locally Recurrent or Metastatic Unresectable Renal Cell Carcinoma", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin and gemcitabine, use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving doxorubicin together with gemcitabine works in treating patients with locally recurrent or metastatic unresectable renal cell carcinoma (kidney cancer).", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate of patients with locally recurrent or metastatic unresectable renal cell cancer with sarcomatoid features treated with doxorubicin and gemcitabine. - Determine the progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive doxorubicin intravenously (IV) and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) on days 2- or 3-10 or pegfilgrastim SC on day 2. Courses repeat every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 6 courses, patients undergo a MUGA scan. Patients with a stable* left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) continue therapy as above. Patients who reach a total doxorubicin dose of 450 mg/m^2 and are found to have unstable cardiac function or who have an abnormal LVEF continue therapy with gemcitabine alone. NOTE: *Stable cardiac function is defined as no decrease more than 15% of LVEF in absolute number and LVEF at least 35% in total function by MUGA. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year. ACTUAL ACCRUAL: A total of 39 patients were accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma", "Renal Cell Carcinoma With Sarcomatoid Features"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Doxorubicin", "Gemcitabine", "G-CSF (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor)", "Neulasta"], "description": ["Doxorubicin: 50 mg/m\u00b2 IV slow push followed by gemcitabine 1500 mg/m\u00b2 IV infusion over 30 minutes on day 1.
