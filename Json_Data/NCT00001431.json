{"brief_title": "A Phase I Trial of Gemcitabine and Radiation in Locally Advanced Unresectable Cancer of the Pancreas", "brief_summary": "Radiotherapy plus Single-Agent Chemotherapy/Radiosensitization. Involved-field irradiation using 4-15 MV photons; plus Gemcitabine, NSC-613327.", "detailed_description": "This is a Phase I trial of gemcitabine given weekly as a 30 minute infusion administered concurrently with radiation in patients with locally advanced or locally recurrent pancreatic carcinoma. Patients will be treated with external beam radiation therapy in a standard manner. Gemcitabine will be administered as a 30 minute infusion beginning on the first day of irradiation and weekly afterwards for a total of 5 doses. Patients will be assessed clinically for acute toxicity which will be graded per RTOG and DCT toxicity grading system.", "condition": ["Gastrointestinal Neoplasms", "Pancreatic Neoplasms"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["gemcitabine"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically or cytologically proven unresectable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas or ampulla of Vater.
