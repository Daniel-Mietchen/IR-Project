{"brief_title": "Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage II or Stage III Oropharyngeal Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of radiation therapy in treating patients who have stage II or stage III oropharyngeal cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Assess target coverage and major salivary gland sparing in patients with stage II or III oropharyngeal cancer treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy. - Determine the nature and prevalence of acute and late side effects of this treatment in these patients. - Determine the rate and pattern of locoregional tumor recurrence in these patients after this treatment. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive 3-D conformal radiotherapy and/or intensity-modulated radiotherapy daily 5 days a week for 6 weeks, in an effort to spare major salivary glands. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 57-64 patients will be accrued for this study over 27 months.", "condition": "Radiation Toxicity", "intervention_type": "Radiation", "intervention_name": "radiation therapy", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically proven stage II or III (T1-T2, N0-N1) squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx (tonsil, base of tongue, or palate) - Lymph nodes in both sides of neck at risk of metastatic disease and require radiotherapy - Patients upstaged by imaging to N2 are eligible - Measurable or evaluable disease - Greater than 1 cm in one dimension or with necrotic regions if by CT or MRI scan - Surgery of the primary tumor or lymph nodes limited to incisional or excisional biopsies - No distant metastases PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - Over 18 Performance status: - Zubrod 0-1 Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - Not specified Hepatic: - Not specified Renal: - Not specified Other: - No active untreated infection - No other malignancy within the past 5 years except nonmelanoma skin cancer or a carcinoma not of head or neck origin - No concurrent major medical or psychiatric illness that would preclude study PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - Not specified Chemotherapy: - More than 3 months since prior chemotherapy - No concurrent chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: - Not specified Radiotherapy: - No prior head or neck radiotherapy Surgery: - See Disease Characteristics Other: - No other concurrent treatment for head and neck cancer - No prophylactic amifostine or pilocarpine", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "120 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00006360.xml"}
