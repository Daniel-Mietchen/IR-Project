{"brief_title": "A Study to Evaluate the Effect of Cimetidine on CD4 Lymphocyte Counts in HIV Infection", "brief_summary": "To determine the change in CD4 count after 4 and 8 weeks in HIV-infected patients treated with cimetidine compared to placebo. To observe time-associated trends at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16 in the change of CD4 counts for patients taking cimetidine for the full 16 weeks. To establish a safety record for cimetidine use in HIV-positive patients.", "condition": ["HIV Infections"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Cimetidine"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: Concurrent Medication: Allowed: - All FDA-approved medications, antiretrovirals, and PCP prophylaxis drugs, with the exception of warfarin (Coumadin). - Other self-prescribed medications available either over the counter or through buyer's clubs.
