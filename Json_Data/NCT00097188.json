or Copaxone(R) within 60 days of randomization - Treatment with IVIG within 60 days of randomization - Plasmapheresis within 60 days of randomization - Treatment with non-lymphocyte depleting immunosuppressive therapies (e.g., azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine) within 90 days prior to randomization - Statins or hormone replacement therapy started within 30 days of randomization - Positive pregnancy test - B-cell count <1.1% (reported as percent CD19) - Vitamin B12 below the lower limit of normal with an abnormal methylmalonic acid level - Positive rapid plasma reagin - Serum creatinine >1.4 mg/dL for women or >1.6 mg/dL for men - Aspartate aminotransferase (AST/SGOT) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT) >2.5 x the upper limit of normal - Platelet count <100,000/mL - Hemoglobin <8.5 g/dL - Neutrophils <1.5 x 10^3/mL - Serum IgG levels below 5.65 mg/mL and serum IgM levels below 0.55 mg/mL - Findings on brain MRI scan consistent with clinically significant conditions other than MS - Electrocardiogram (ECG) showing significant abnormality that the treating investigator determines may jeopardize the subject's health (i.e., acute ischemia, left bundle branch, or bifascicular block)", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "55 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis", "mesh_term": ["Sclerosis", "Multiple Sclerosis", "Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting", "Rituximab"], "id": "NCT00097188"}
