{"brief_title": "Botanical/Drug Interactions in HIV: Glucuronidation", "brief_summary": "A series of clinical studies will be conducted in normal, healthy adult volunteers to evaluate the potential for alterations in the pharmacokinetics of anti HIV drugs when botanicals/nutriceuticals are given concurrently via the oral route. Both the drugs and botanicals are known to rely upon or to modulate, respectively, metabolism via glucuronidation.", "detailed_description": "As per Brief Summary", "condition": "HIV Seronegativity", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "silymarin", "criteria": "Inclusion criteria: - Absence of HIV-1 infections - Body mass index less than or equal to 30 kg/m2 and weigh at least 50 kg. - Laboratory values obtained within 7 days of study entry within normal range for healthy volunteers. - Able to be compliant with dosing schedules and diary record keeping. - Able to follow dietary restrictions associated with the protocol. - Ability and willingness to provide informed consent - All women of reproductive potential must have a negative pregnancy test - All women of reproductive potential to use contraception methods as defined by protocol - All study subjects (male and female) must agree to not participate in a conception process Exclusion Criteria: - History of any acute or chronic illness that requires current medical therapy including active gastrointestinal conditions that might interfere with drug absorption. - History of hepatic, renal, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal diseases. - Current gastrointestinal disturbance. - Receipt of any prescribed or over the counter medication or ingested CAM during the 30 days prior to study entry except: Over the counter acetaminophen or ibuprofen at doses not exceeding package labeling guidelines. - Any medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the subject\u2019s ability to participate in this protocol. - Pregnancy or breastfeeding. - Allergy/sensitivity to study agent(s) or their formulations. - Active drug or alcohol abuse or dependence, which in the opinion of the investigator would interfere with adherence to study requirements or would endanger the subject\u2019s health while on study. - Before entering the study, subjects must agree not to consume alcohol for 48 hours prior to PK sampling days. - Participation in any investigational drug studies within 30 days prior to study entry and during study.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "50 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "Accepts Healthy Volunteers", "id": "NCT00065741.xml"}
