Patients who previously responded (complete response or partial response) to fludarabine or alemtuzumab therapy, but who have relapsed at the time of study entry, may be eligible but response to fludarabine or alemtuzumab therapy must have lasted >12 months (i.e., >12 months from a documented response to a documented relapse). - Binet stage A, stage B, or stage C or Rai Stage I through IV disease with evidence of progression as evidenced by the presence of one or more of the following: I. Evidence of progressive marrow failure as manifested by: 1) a decrease in hemoglobin to <11g/dL, or 2) a decrease in platelet count to <100 x 10^9/L within the previous 6 months, or 3) a decrease in absolute neutrophil count (ANC) to <1.0 X 10^9/L.
