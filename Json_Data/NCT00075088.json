{"brief_title": "Tele-Electrocardiography in Emergency Cardiac Care", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to see whether individuals who access the \"911\" emergency medical system with a heart attack or severe chest pain will receive more timely hospital treatment and better outcomes if hospital clinicians are provided with earlier and more complete electrocardiography (ECG) information.", "detailed_description": "This is a Phase III study. Patients will be randomized (like tossing a coin) to 1 of 2 groups: Group 1: Patients will have pre-hospital ECG intervention. Group 2: Patients will have routine emergency heart care. Information will be collected about time symptoms started, clinical management, and other measures. All patients will be contacted by telephone 12 months later and interviewed as to whether they experienced any cardiac symptoms.", "condition": ["Myocardial Infarction", "Chest Pain"], "intervention_type": ["Device", "Other"], "intervention_name": ["Electrocardiogram (ECG) Intervention", "Routine Clinical Practice"], "description": ["Pre-hospital electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring with special software to detect myocardial ischemia and to automatically transmit an ECG to the destination hospital emergency department with a voice alarm announcing \"Incoming ECG from the field\" and print out in the ED.", "ECG in the ED as part of routine clinical practice."], "arm_group_label": ["Electrocardiogram (ECG) Intervention", "Routine Clinical Practice"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - All individuals in Santa Cruz County in California who call 911 with symptoms of acute coronary syndrome (chest pain, shortness of breath, anginal equivalent).
