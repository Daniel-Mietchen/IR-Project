{"brief_title": "Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT): Degenerative Spondylolisthesis With Spinal Stenosis", "brief_summary": "This study tests the effectiveness of different treatments for the three most commonly diagnosed conditions of the lower backbone (lumbar spine). The purpose is to learn which of two commonly prescribed treatments (surgery and nonsurgical therapy) works better for specific types of low back pain. In this part of the study, we will treat patients with spinal stenosis (a narrowing of spaces in the backbone that results in pressure on the spinal cord and/or nerve roots) caused by degenerative spondylolisthesis (a condition in which one vertebra, or spinal bone, slips forward on another) with either surgery or nonsurgical methods. This study does not cover the cost of treatment.", "detailed_description": "Low back pain is considered one of the most widely experienced health problems in the U.S. and the world. It is the second most frequent condition, after the common cold, for which patients see a physician or lose days from work. Estimated costs to those who are severely disabled from low back pain range from $30-70 billion annually. Rates of spinal surgery in the U.S. have increased sharply over time, and researchers have documented 15-fold geographic variation in rates of these surgeries. In many cases, where one lives and who one sees for the condition appear to determine the rates of surgery. Despite these trends, there is little evidence proving the effectiveness of these therapies over nonsurgical management. This study will use the National Spine Network to conduct a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial for the three most common diagnostic groups for which spine surgery is performed: lumbar intervertebral disc herniation (IDH), spinal stenosis (SpS), and spinal stenosis secondary to degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS). This arm of the trial will deal with patients from the third diagnostic group. The study will compare the most commonly used standard surgical treatments to the most commonly used standard nonsurgical treatments. We will conduct the study at 12 sites throughout the United States. The primary endpoint of the study will be changes in health-related quality of life as measured by the SF-36 health status questionnaire. Secondary endpoints will include patient satisfaction with treatment, utility for current health in order to estimate quality-adjusted life years (QALYS) as the measure for cost-effectiveness, resource use, and cost. We will follow patients at 6 weeks and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to determine their health status, function, satisfaction, and health care use. We anticipate that we will enroll and randomly allocate a total of 300 study participants in this arm of the trial. We will track an additional observational cohort to assess health and resource outcomes. Enrollment in the Observational cohort has been completed as of February 2003. We will integrate data from the trial and observational cohorts to formally estimate the cost-effectiveness of surgical versus nonsurgical interventions for IDH, SpS, and DS. The results of this trial will provide, for the first time, scientific evidence as to the relative effectiveness of surgical versus nonsurgical treatment for these three most commonly diagnosed lumbar spine conditions.", "condition": ["Spondylolisthesis", "Spinal Stenosis", "Low Back Pain"], "intervention_type": ["Procedure", "Other", "Procedure", "Procedure"], "intervention_name": ["Decompressive laminectomy", "Non-surgical treatments", "Fusion--Instrumented", "Fusion-Non-instrumented"], "description": ["Removal of the hypertrophic inferior and superior articular facets will be performed when they are intruding upon the midline and causing both central and lateral recess stenosis", "Active physical therapy modality, Education/Counseling with home exercise instruction, and an NSAID if tolerated.
