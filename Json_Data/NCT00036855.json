{"brief_title": "Radiolabeled Monoclonal Antibody With or Without Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation in Treating Children With Recurrent or Refractory Lymphoma", "brief_summary": "Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of radiolabeled monoclonal antibody therapy with or without peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory lymphoma. Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies can locate cancer cells and deliver radioactive tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Peripheral stem cell transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were destroyed by anticancer therapy", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan (IDEC-Y2B8) when preceded by rituximab in children with recurrent or refractory CD20-positive lymphoma for which no autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (AuPBSCT) is planned. (Group A) If the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in group A is purely hematological, determine the MTD of IDEC-Y2B8 when combined with rituximab, AuPBSCT, and filgrastim (G-CSF) in a second group of children with recurrent or refractory CD20-positive lymphoma. (Group B) II. Determine the DLT of rituximab and IDEC-Y2B8 in these patients. III. Determine the dosimetry of indium In 111 ibritumomab tiuxetan preceded by rituximab in these patients. IV. Determine, preliminarily, the antitumor activity of rituximab and IDEC-Y2B8 in these patients. V. Assess the immune cell depletion (B-cell and T-cell) and recovery in patients treated with this regimen. VI. Determine the human anti-mouse antibody response in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan (IDEC-Y2B8). Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups. GROUP A (no planned peripheral blood stem cell [PBSC] support): Patients receive rituximab IV over 4-6 hours followed by indium In 111 ibritumomab tiuxetan (IDEC-In2B8) IV over 10 minutes on day 0 and undergo whole body imaging. Patients may then receive rituximab IV over 4-6 hours followed by IDEC-Y2B8 IV over 10 minutes on day 7. Cohorts of 3-6 patients in each subgroup (A1, A2, and A3) receive escalating doses of IDEC-Y2B8 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined (subgroup A1 closed as of 10/8/04). The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Some patients receive autologous PBSC IV over 30-60 minutes on day 35. GROUP B (planned PBSC support): Patients receive rituximab, IDEC-In2B8, and IDEC-Y2B8 as in group A. Patients also receive autologous PBSC IV over 30-60 minutes on day 21 and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously beginning on day 22 and continuing until blood counts recover or day 35. If the DLT in group A is purely hematological, cohorts of 3-6 patients in group B receive escalating doses of IDEC-Y2B8 until the MTD is determined. The MTD is defined as in group A. Patients in both groups are followed at days 63, 90, 180, 365, and then annually thereafter.", "condition": "Recurrent/Refractory Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma", "intervention_type": "Other", "intervention_name": "laboratory biomarker analysis", "description": "Correlative studies", "arm_group_label": "Group B (planned PBSC support)", "other_name": "Neupogen", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Histologically confirmed and immunophenotypically (CD20)-positive lymphoma at original diagnosis, progression, or relapse - Refractory to conventional therapy - First recurrent/refractory CD20-positive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) allowed if ineligible for or refused regimens with known curative potential (high-dose chemotherapy plus bone marrow transplantation) (if available) - Second or third progression and/or recurrence of NHL - Second or third relapse/refractory CD20-positive Hodgkin's lymphoma - CD20-positive, post-transplantation lymphoproliferative lymphoma that is medically refractory (decreased immunosuppression) to rituximab and/or chemotherapy - Medically refractory, HIV-associated, CD20-positive NHL - Recurrent/refractory CD20-positive lymphoblastic lymphoma - Autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) collected, selected for a minimum of 2 x 10^6 CD34-positive cells per kg, and cryopreserved before study entry - Meets one of the following criteria for bone marrow reserve: - Good marrow reserve, defined by both of the following: - No prior myeloablative stem cell transplantation (SCT) - No prior extensive radiotherapy, defined by any of the following: - Prior total body irradiation - Prior radiotherapy dose of 3,600 cGy or more to cranio-spinal axis - Prior radiotherapy to 50% or more of bone marrow - Poor marrow reserve, defined by either or both of the following: - Prior myeloablative SCT - Prior extensive radiotherapy - Performance status - Lansky 50-100% (age 10 and under) - Performance status - Karnofsky 50-100% (age 11 to 21) - At least 2 months - Absolute neutrophil count \u2265 1,000/mm^3 - Platelet count \u2265 100,000/mm^3 for patients with poor marrow reserve (transfusion independent) - Platelet count \u2265 150,000 for patients with good marrow reserve (transfusion independent) - Hemoglobin \u2265 8.0 g/dL (transfusion allowed) - Bilirubin \u2264 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) - ALT \u2264 5 times ULN - Albumin \u2265 2 g/dL - Creatinine normal - Creatinine clearance or glomerular filtration rate \u2265 70 mL/min - Shortening fraction \u2265 27% by echocardiogram - Ejection fraction \u2265 50% by MUGA - No dyspnea at rest - No exercise intolerance - Oxygen saturation (SpO_2) > 94% by pulse oximetry (if there is a clinical indication for SpO_2 assessment) - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - No documented infection that is unresponsive to appropriate antibiotic, antiviral, or antifungal therapy - No grade 2 or greater CNS toxicity - Seizure disorder allowed if well controlled and on anticonvulsants - See Disease Characteristics - Recovered from prior immunotherapy - At least 1 week since prior antineoplastic biologic agents - Prior SCT allowed if the following criteria are met: - At least 60 days since prior SCT - Full hematopoietic reconstitution post-SCT - No evidence of active acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease if post- allogeneic SCT - No concurrent sargramostim (GM-CSF) - See Disease Characteristics - At least 3 weeks since prior myelosuppressive chemotherapy (4 weeks for nitrosourea) and recovered - See Disease Characteristics - Recovered from prior radiotherapy - No concurrent medications that would interact with the study drug", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "21 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00036855.xml"}
