{"brief_title": "The Safety and Effectiveness of Ganciclovir in the Prevention of Cytomegalovirus (CMV) of the Eyes and Disease of the Stomach and Intestines in Patients With HIV", "brief_summary": "To evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral ganciclovir for prophylaxis against cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinal and gastrointestinal mucosal disease in HIV-infected patients with severe immunosuppression. The most recent treatments against CMV disease have been ganciclovir and foscarnet. Until recently, both drugs required intravenous administration. An oral form of ganciclovir, if shown to be effective therapy against CMV, would be a more suitable method of administration for prophylaxis.", "detailed_description": "The most recent treatments against CMV disease have been ganciclovir and foscarnet. Until recently, both drugs required intravenous administration. An oral form of ganciclovir, if shown to be effective therapy against CMV, would be a more suitable method of administration for prophylaxis. Patients are randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either oral ganciclovir or placebo for a minimum of 12 months. PER AMENDMENT 9/19/94: Patients who have not reached a study endpoint may choose to continue blinded prophylaxis or discontinue blinded prophylaxis and begin open-label ganciclovir. PER AMENDMENT 5/2/95: After the common closing date (6/3/95) patients who have not met a CMV end point or experienced a serious toxicity that required permanent discontinuation of active oral ganciclovir will be eligible to receive open-label oral ganciclovir through an open-label extension phase of study 023 until 8/31/95.", "condition": ["Cytomegalovirus Retinitis", "HIV Infections", "Gastrointestinal Diseases"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Ganciclovir"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria Concurrent Medication: Allowed: - Antiretroviral therapy. - Anti-PCP prophylaxis. - Maintenance or prophylaxis therapy for other opportunistic infections besides CMV.
