(Intravenous) in Patients With HIV Infection.", "brief_summary": "To evaluate the clinical toxicity, safety, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of intravenous nystatin in patients with HIV infection. To evaluate the potential anti-HIV activity and clinical pharmacology of intravenous nystatin.", "detailed_description": "Cohorts of three patients each are treated at escalating doses of intravenous nystatin, administered every other day, until the MTD is reached.

(Patients with CD4 count > 200 cells/mm3 who are already on aerosolized pentamidine may continue such therapy at the discretion of the investigator.) Allowed: - Prophylaxis against Mycobacterium avium Complex in patients with CD4 count <= 100 cells/mm3. Concurrent Treatment: Allowed: - Local treatment for Kaposi's sarcoma lesions with less than 25 percent increase in measurable disease. Patients must have: - HIV antibody positivity. - Absolute CD4 count < 500 cells/mm3 on two determinations within 15 days prior to study entry. - At least 6 months of prior zidovudine (AZT) therapy. - No active opportunistic infection requiring ongoing therapy. - Normal neurologic status by standard assessment. - Life expectancy of at least 6 months. Exclusion Criteria Co-existing Condition: Patients with the following symptoms and conditions are excluded: - Neoplasm other than basal cell carcinoma of the skin or stable untreated HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma (provided there is no progression in the Kaposi's sarcoma beyond 25 percent of measurable disease). - Clinically significant cardiac disease. - Known hypersensitivity to polyene antibiotics. Patients with the following prior conditions are excluded: - History of myocardial infarction or arrhythmias. Prior Medication: Excluded within 2 weeks prior to study entry: - Antiretroviral agents or interferons. - Biological response modifiers. - Corticosteroids. - Cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. - Drugs that can cause neutropenia or significant nephrotoxicity. - Rifampin or rifampin derivatives. - Systemic anti-infectives.
