{"brief_title": "Endoscopic Placement of Metal Stents in Treating Patients With Cancer- Related Duodenal Obstruction", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: The use of endoscopy to place metal stents in the duodenum is less invasive than surgery for treating cancer-related duodenal obstruction and may have fewer side effects and improve recovery. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of endoscopic placement of metal stents in treating patients who have cancer-related obstruction of the duodenum.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the objective response and clinical outcome in patients with duodenal obstruction secondary to malignancy treated with enteral Wallstents. - Evaluate the efficacy and safety of this treatment in these patients. - Evaluate the quality of life of these patients after enteral Wallstent placement. OUTLINE: Patients undergo enteral Wallstent placement through an endoscope under fluoroscopic guidance into the duodenum. Quality of life is assessed at 48 hours and 6 months after procedure. Patients are followed at 48 hours, 30 days, 6 months, and then yearly thereafter until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Colorectal Cancer", "Constipation, Impaction, and Bowel Obstruction", "Extrahepatic Bile Duct Cancer", "Gastric Cancer", "Gastrointestinal Carcinoid Tumor", "Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor", "Pancreatic Cancer", "Quality of Life", "Small Intestine Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Procedure", "Procedure"], "intervention_name": ["bowel obstruction management", "quality-of-life assessment"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Endoscopically confirmed localized tumor as the cause of duodenal obstruction - All primary tumor types are eligible - No prior duodenal Wallstents - Must have symptoms of gastrointestinal obstruction, including: - Inability to move bowels, absence of flatus, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, or diarrhea PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 and over Performance status: - ECOG 0-3 Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - Platelet count greater than 50,000/mm^3 Hepatic: - INR no greater than 1.5 times upper limit of normal Renal: - Not specified Cardiovascular: - No cardiac condition Other: - Not pregnant or nursing - Fertile patients must use effective contraception - No significant active infection (e.g., pneumonia, peritonitis, or wound abscess) that would preclude endoscopy - No other serious concurrent illness - No uncontrolled metabolic disease (e.g., diabetes mellitus or hypothyroidism) - No dementia, psychiatric disorder, or altered mental status that would preclude compliance - History of other neoplastic disease allowed - Veterans Administration patients are not eligible PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - Not specified Chemotherapy: - Prior or concurrent chemotherapy allowed Endocrine therapy: - Not specified Radiotherapy: - Prior or concurrent radiotherapy allowed Surgery: - At least 3 weeks since prior surgery and recovered", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "stage IV pancreatic cancer", "mesh_term": ["Neoplasms", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "Pancreatic Neoplasms", "Stomach Neoplasms", "Constipation", "Carcinoid Tumor", "Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors", "Bile Duct Neoplasms", "Neuroendocrine Tumors", "Intestinal Neoplasms", "Intestinal Obstruction", "Malignant Carcinoid Syndrome", "Gastrointestinal Neoplasms", "Duodenal Obstruction"], "id": "NCT00004910"}
