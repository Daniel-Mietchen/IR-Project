{"brief_title": "Study to Evaluate Motesanib With or Without Carboplatin/Paclitaxel or Panitumumab in the Treatment of Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this trial is: - To characterize the safety profile of motesanib when used in combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel (CP), with panitumumab or with CP and panitumumab in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). - To establish the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of motesanib when it is used in combination with CP, with panitumumab, or with CP and panitumumab. - To compare the paclitaxel and motesanib PK profiles when the medications are administered 30 minutes (min) or approximately 48 hours (hrs) apart. - To characterize the panitumumab and paclitaxel exposure in the combination regimens of motesanib with CP, motesanib with panitumumab, or motesanib with CP and panitumumab. - To describe the objective response rate (ORR) in each dose cohort. - To measure the immunogenicity of panitumumab in patients administered motesanib with panitumumab and motesanib with CP and panitumumab.", "detailed_description": "This was a multicenter, open-label, dose-finding clinical trial examining the safety and PK of once or twice daily motesanib administered with CP or with CP and panitumumab in chemotherapy na\u00efve patients, and with panitumumab in patients with no more than one prior chemotherapy regimen for NSCLC.
