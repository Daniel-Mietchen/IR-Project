Patients are randomized at the completion of induction phase therapy. Sample-size is 50 HIV-seronegative patients with culture-positive, drug susceptible TB in each treatment arm. The first 75 patients will be randomized 2:1 to 900 mg:600 mg rifapentine. The second 75 patients will be randomized 2:1 to 1200 mg:600 mg rifapentine. The DSMB will review tolerability and safety data on the first 21 patients enrolled (at the 900 mg and 600 mg doses) and approve proceeding to enrollment at the 1200 mg dose.", "condition": ["Tuberculosis"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["rifapentine"], "criteria": "Inclusions: 1.
