{"brief_title": "Phase I Study of Heme Arginate With or Without Tin Mesoporphyrin in Patients With Acute Attacks of Porphyria", "brief_summary": "OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy of tin mesoporphyrin in patients with acute porphyria attacks who are also treated with a standard course of heme arginate. II. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of tin mesoporphyrin when administered to these patients.", "detailed_description": "PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is an randomized, unblinded, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to receive heme arginate alone or both heme arginate and tin mesoporphyrin. Patients receive a single intravenous dose of tin mesoporphyrin immediately before the first dose of heme arginate. Heme arginate is administered daily for 4 days. Patients are followed at 3 and 6 days after treatment.", "condition": ["Porphyria"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["heme arginate", "tin mesoporphyrin"], "criteria": "PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA: --Disease Characteristics-- Documented acute intermittent porphyria, variegate porphyria, or hereditary coproporphyria No chronic or subacute symptoms (present for longer than 2 weeks) --Prior/Concurrent Therapy-- At least 3 weeks since prior treatment with heme arginate or tin mesoporphyrin --Patient Characteristics-- Renal: Urinary porphobilinogen at least 40 mg/24 hr Other: - Not pregnant - Fertile female patients must use effective contraception during and 6 months before study - No evidence that symptoms are due to another acute illness - No acute hemorrhagic disorder such as: Gastrointestinal bleeding Intracerebral hemorrhage - No known sensitivity to heme preparation or tin mesoporphyrin - No other medical condition that might increase risk to patient", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "rare disease", "mesh_term": ["Porphyrias", "Porphyria, Erythropoietic", "Tin mesoporphyrin"], "id": "NCT00004398"}
