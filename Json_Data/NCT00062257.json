{"brief_title": "Irofulven in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Gastric Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irofulven, use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well irofulven works in treating patients with recurrent or metastatic gastric cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate of patients with recurrent or metastatic gastric cancer treated with irofulven. - Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients. - Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients receive irofulven IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or static disease after 4 courses in the absence of clinical benefit. Patients are followed for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 5-9 months.", "condition": "Gastric Cancer", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "irofulven", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically or cytologically confirmed gastric adenocarcinoma - Recurrent or metastatic disease - Adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction eligible provided the majority of tumor bulk is below the junction - Measurable disease - At least 1 lesion at least 20 mm by conventional techniques OR at least 10 mm by spiral CT scan - No known brain metastases PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - Over 18 Performance status - ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy - More than 3 months Hematopoietic - WBC at least 3,000/mm^3 - Absolute neutrophil count at least 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 100,000/mm^3 - No active disseminated intravascular coagulation Hepatic - Bilirubin no greater than 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) - AST/ALT no greater than 2.5 times ULN (5 times ULN for patients with liver metastases) - Alkaline phosphatase no greater than 5 times ULN Renal - Creatinine no greater than 1.5 times ULN Cardiovascular - No symptomatic congestive heart failure - No unstable angina pectoris - No cardiac arrhythmia Other - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception - No prior allergic reaction attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biological composition to irofulven - No other malignancy within the past 5 years except adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix or basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer - No other uncontrolled concurrent illness that would preclude study participation - No ongoing or active infection - No psychiatric illness or social situation that would preclude study compliance - Must have central or peripherally inserted central catheter PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - No concurrent filgrastim (G-CSF), sargramostim (GM-CSF), or epoetin alfa Chemotherapy - No prior chemotherapy for recurrent or metastatic disease - Prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy allowed provided disease relapsed more than 6 months after therapy Endocrine therapy - Not specified Radiotherapy - More than 4 weeks since prior radiotherapy and recovered Surgery - Not specified Other - No other concurrent investigational or commercial agents or therapies for the malignancy - No concurrent combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-positive patients", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00062257.xml"}
