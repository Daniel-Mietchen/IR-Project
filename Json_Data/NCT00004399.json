{"brief_title": "Randomized Study of Nimodipine Versus Magnesium Sulfate in the Prevention of Eclamptic Seizures in Patients With Severe Preeclampsia", "brief_summary": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effectiveness of nimodipine versus magnesium sulfate in the prevention of eclamptic seizures in patients with severe preeclampsia.", "detailed_description": "PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, international, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to receive either nimodipine or magnesium sulfate. Arm I: Patients receive nimodipine by mouth every 4 hours. Treatment is continued until 24 hours post-partum. Arm II: Patients receive a loading dose of magnesium sulfate IV for 20 minutes, followed by continuous infusion of magnesium sulfate. Treatment is continued until 24 hours post-partum.", "condition": "Pre-eclampsia", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "nimodipine", "criteria": "PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA: --Disease Characteristics-- - Histologically diagnosed severe preeclampsia at risk for eclamptic convulsions with the following criteria: - Blood pressure greater than 160/110 mmHg OR Mean arterial pressure of 126 mmHg - Proteinuria greater than 5 g/24 hr - Epigastric pain OR Right upper quadrant pain AST/ALT greater than 70 U/L - Severe headache and/or scotomata - Thrombocytopenia as evidenced by: Platelet count less than 100,000/mm3 Disseminated intravascular coagulation Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia Oliguria (less than 400 mL/day or 30 mL/hr) - Pulmonary edema --Prior/Concurrent Therapy-- - No prior/concurrent magnesium sulfate or dihydropyridine agents - No other concurrent antiseizure medications --Patient Characteristics-- - Age: Not specified - Performance status: Not specified - Hematopoietic: See Disease Characteristics - Hepatic: See Disease Characteristics - Renal: No severe renal failure See Disease Characteristics - Cardiovascular: No history of angina or myocardial infarction No cardiac dysfunction No history or sign of congestive cardiac failure No arrhythmia with ventricular rate less than 60 bpm See Disease Characteristics - Pulmonary: See Disease Characteristics --Other:-- - No severe mental or physical disorder that may affect therapy - Not allergic to drugs with chemical structure similar to nimodipine or magnesium sulfate - No evidence of fetal distress or fetal anomalies", "gender": "Female", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00004399.xml"}
