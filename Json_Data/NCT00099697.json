{"brief_title": "Biologic Effects of Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in Humans", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to determine whether DHEA replacement therapy decreases abdominal fat and improves insulin sensitivity.", "detailed_description": "Studies on rats and mice have shown that the adrenal hormone dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) reduces abdominal visceral fat and protects against insulin resistance. This study was done to learn if DHEA replacement therapy decreases abdominal obesity and improves insulin action in humans. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 50 mg per day of DHEA or a placebo at bedtime for 6 months. Participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and oral glucose tolerance tests at the beginning and conclusion of the study. Other tests included measurements of hormones and lipids.", "condition": "Insulin Resistance", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "DHEA", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - 65 to 78 years old - Physically healthy - Non-smoker - On stable medications for at least 6 months - Stable body weight for the past year Exclusion Criteria: - Serious active medical problems - Hormone therapy - Abnormal PSA (prostate specific antigen) in men", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "65 Years", "maximum_age": "78 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "Accepts Healthy Volunteers", "id": "NCT00099697.xml"}
