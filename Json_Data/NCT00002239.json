{"brief_title": "A Study to Compare Three Doses of T-20 When Given in Combination With Abacavir, Amprenavir, Ritonavir, and Efavirenz to HIV-Infected Adults", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to give T-20, a new type of anti-HIV drug, with a combination of other anti-HIV drugs. The other anti-HIV drugs used are abacavir (ABC), amprenavir (APV), ritonavir (RTV), and efavirenz (EFV). Three different doses of T-20 are tested.", "detailed_description": "Patients are assigned to one of four groups. Three dose groups receive a background antiretroviral regimen (ABC, APV, RTV, and EFV) and T-20, which is given at one of three doses on a twice-daily regimen. The fourth group (control) receives the background antiretroviral regimen alone. For each treatment group, 17 patients are enrolled. Treatment is administered for 16 weeks, followed by a 32-week treatment extension, and a 2-week follow-up period. The following are assessed throughout the trial: safety parameters (as measured by hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, and treatment-emergent adverse events); virologic and immunologic activity; phenotypic and genotypic resistance; T-20 plasma levels; and pharmacokinetics of T-20 and oral antiretrovirals. The total study duration is 1 year.", "condition": ["HIV Infections"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Drug", "Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Enfuvirtide", "Ritonavir", "Abacavir sulfate", "Amprenavir", "Efavirenz"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria Patients may be eligible for this study if they: - Are HIV-positive. - Have an HIV level (viral load) between 400 and 100,000 copies/ml at the screening visit. - Have taken at least 1 PI (protease inhibitor) for at least 16 weeks, and have had no interruptions in their most recent PI-containing anti-HIV drug regimen. - Are at least 18 years old. - Agree to abstinence or use of 2 effective methods of birth control, including a barrier method, during the study.
