{"brief_title": "Anastrozole Biphosphonate Study in Postmenopausal Women With Hormone-Receptor-Positive Early Breast Cancer", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety parameters of anastrozole with regard to its potential effects on postmenopausal bone loss and on lipid profiles. This trial is conducted to investigate the effects of risedronate on BMD and on bone metabolism in postmenopausal women using anastrozole as adjuvant therapy for hormone-receptor-positive early breast cancer and who are high or moderate risk of fragility fracture. It is also conducted to determine the effects of anastrozole on bone mineral density (BMD) and on bone metabolism in women at low risk of fragility fracture.", "condition": "Breast Cancer", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Risedronate Sodium", "description": "35mg/week, oral", "arm_group_label": "3", "other_name": "ACTONEL\u2122", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Women defined as Postmenopausal - Histologically proven operable invasive breast cancer - Hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer Exclusion Criteria: - Clinical evidence of metastatic disease - Bilateral hip fractures or bilateral hip prosthesis - Receiving or received in last 12 months hormonal therapy for breast cancer, bisphosphonate therapy, oestrogens - Malabsorption syndrome", "gender": "Female", "minimum_age": "55 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00082277.xml"}
