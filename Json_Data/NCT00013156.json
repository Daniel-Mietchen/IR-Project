Objectives: Evaluate cost-effectiveness of LVRS compared to current therapy for COPD. Methods: This is a case control study in which veterans undergoing LVRS at VA Puget Sound Health Care System (VAPSHCS) are compared to patients with a similar severity of disease at Boise VAMC who are not undergoing LVRS. Changes in health related quality of life are being evaluated using three instruments: the SF-36, the St. George\ufffds Respiratory Questionnaire, and the Quality of Well-Being Scale, the latter to calculate utility associated with different health states. Costs will be determined using utilization data on outpatient visits, medications, oxygen use, inpatient days, radiology tests, laboratory tests, and emergency room visits are being collected for the twelve months before and after surgery. Costs will be calculated according to VA and community standards.
