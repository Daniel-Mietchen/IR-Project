{"brief_title": "A Study Using Intravenous Paxceed\u2122 to Treat Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis", "brief_summary": "Paxceed\u2122 is being developed by Angiotech Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). The main objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of treatment with Paxceed\u2122 in patients with RA. In RA, there is an increase in cell growth and changes in cell function. The active substance in Paxceed\u2122, paclitaxel, has undergone clinical studies as a cancer chemotherapeutic agent and has demonstrated its usefulness as an agent that stops growth of cells and blocks certain types of cell function associated with RA. Because of these effects, it is thought that Paxceed\u2122 might alter the destructive course of RA.", "condition": "Rheumatoid Arthritis", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Micellar Paclitaxel for Injection", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: (i) Signed informed consent in accordance with applicable regulations (ii) Males and females aged 21 to 70 years inclusive (iii) Must have failed at least one DMARD (iv) Rheumatoid Arthritis fulfilling 1987 ACR revised criteria (v) Active RA as defined by: - \u22656 swollen and \u22659 tender joints - CRP \u22650.8 mg/dL or morning stiffness \u226545 minutes (vi) If female and of child bearing potential, she must: - have a negative serum pregnancy test, and - be using two forms of an effective method of contraception (one form being a barrier method) or be surgically incapable of bearing children or abstinent.
