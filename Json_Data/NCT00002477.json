{"brief_title": "Adjuvant Chemotherapy Compared With Observation in Treating Patients With Resected Early Stage Ovarian Epithelial Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of adjuvant therapy using platinum-based chemotherapy drugs with no adjuvant therapy in treating patients with early stage invasive ovarian epithelial cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether adjuvant chemotherapy with a platinum-containing regimen (e.g., carboplatin or CAP: cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/cisplatin) prolongs survival in patients with early stage ovarian cancer compared to those receiving no adjuvant treatment. OUTLINE: Randomized study. Patients are randomized to Arm I or II; treatment should begin within 6 weeks of surgery. Regimens listed in Arm I are recommended, but other platinum-containing regimens are allowed provided the doses at a minimum meet those listed below. Arm I: Single-agent Chemotherapy or 3-Drug Combination Chemotherapy. Carboplatin, CBDCA, NSC-241240; or CAP: Cyclophosphamide, CTX, NSC-26271; Doxorubicin, DOX, NSC-123127; Cisplatin, CDDP, NSC-119875. Arm II: Observation. No adjuvant therapy. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 2,000 patients will be randomized.", "condition": ["Ovarian Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["carboplatin", "cisplatin", "cyclophosphamide", "doxorubicin hydrochloride"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed invasive ovarian cancer of epithelial origin All tumor resected prior to randomization Uncertain whether immediate chemotherapy is required PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: Any age Performance status: Sufficient to receive chemotherapy Hematopoietic: Not specified Hepatic: Not specified Renal: Not specified Other: No prior malignancy except nonmelanomatous skin cancer No clear contraindication to chemotherapy PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: Not specified Chemotherapy: No prior chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: Not specified Radiotherapy: No prior radiotherapy Surgery: Minimum recommended surgical procedures (when possible): Thorough surgical staging Total hysterectomy/bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy Omentectomy, as follows: Total supracolonic omentectomy if omentum involved Removal of distal 2 cm or infracolonic omentectomy in the absence of macroscopic disease", "gender": "Female", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "stage II ovarian epithelial cancer", "mesh_term": ["Ovarian Neoplasms", "Cyclophosphamide", "Liposomal doxorubicin", "Carboplatin", "Doxorubicin"], "id": "NCT00002477"}
