{"brief_title": "Evaluation of Two Doses of QVAR by Breath Operated and Metered Dose Inhalers in Asthmatic Children", "brief_summary": "The primary objective of this study is to compare the QVAR-Easi-Breathe 100 mcg/day and QVAR-Easi-Breathe 200 mcg/day with placebo relative to changes in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) results following 12 weeks of treatment. Secondary objectives such as daily asthma symptoms scores (per week), morning peak expiratory flow (PEF) values, nocturnal awakening and utilization of rescue medication per day also will be evaluated. In addition, an exploratory evaluation will assess the comparability of the two devices (i.e., QVAR-Easi-Breathe versus QVAR-MDI) at the same dose levels.", "condition": "Asthma", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "beclomethasone dipropionate", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Male or female children aged 5 through 11 years at the screening visit - Documented clinical evidence of asthma (FEV1 = 65-90%) - Ability to perform acceptable and reproducible spirometry per ATS guidelines - Ability to perform PEF determinations - Reversible bronchoconstriction as verified by >12% increase in FEV1 - Otherwise healthy children with clinically-acceptable medical history, physical examination, vital signs and clinical laboratory parameters within the acceptable ranges for asthma patients - The parent or guardian must be willing to give written informed consent as well as the patient assent and be able to adhere to the dose and visit schedule.
