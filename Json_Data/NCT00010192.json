{"brief_title": "Rituximab Plus Interleukin-2 in Treating Patients With Hematologic Cancer", "brief_summary": "Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill cancer cells. Combining rituximab with interleukin-2 may kill more cancer cells. Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of rituximab plus interleukin-2 in treating patients who have hematologic cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: Determine the dose-limiting toxicity of rituximab followed by low-dose and intermediate-dose pulse interleukin-2 (IL-2) in patients with CD20-positive B-cell lymphoid malignancy. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of intermediate-dose pulse IL-2 in this patient population. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of intermediate-dose pulse aldesleukin. Patients receive rituximab IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Patients then receive low-dose aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC) on days 29-39, 43-53, 57-67, and 71-81, and intermediate-dose aldesleukin SC on days 40-42, 54-56, 68-70, and 82-84. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of intermediate-dose pulse aldesleukin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.", "condition": ["B-cell Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia", "Extranodal Marginal Zone B-cell Lymphoma of Mucosa-associated Lymphoid Tissue", "Nodal Marginal Zone B-cell Lymphoma", "Noncontiguous Stage II Adult Burkitt Lymphoma", "Noncontiguous Stage II Adult Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma", "Noncontiguous Stage II Adult Diffuse Mixed Cell Lymphoma", "Noncontiguous Stage II Adult Diffuse Small Cleaved Cell Lymphoma", "Noncontiguous Stage II Adult Immunoblastic Large Cell Lymphoma", "Noncontiguous Stage II Adult Lymphoblastic Lymphoma", "Noncontiguous Stage II Grade 1 Follicular Lymphoma", "Noncontiguous Stage II Grade 2 Follicular Lymphoma", "Noncontiguous Stage II Grade 3 Follicular Lymphoma", "Noncontiguous Stage II Mantle Cell Lymphoma", "Noncontiguous Stage II Marginal Zone Lymphoma", "Noncontiguous Stage II Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia", "Recurrent Adult Burkitt Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Diffuse Mixed Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Diffuse Small Cleaved Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Immunoblastic Large Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Lymphoblastic Lymphoma", "Recurrent Grade 1 Follicular Lymphoma", "Recurrent Grade 2 Follicular Lymphoma", "Recurrent Grade 3 Follicular Lymphoma", "Recurrent Mantle Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Marginal Zone Lymphoma", "Recurrent Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma", "Splenic Marginal Zone Lymphoma", "Stage III Adult Burkitt Lymphoma", "Stage III Adult Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma", "Stage III Adult Diffuse Mixed Cell Lymphoma", "Stage III Adult Diffuse Small Cleaved Cell Lymphoma", "Stage III Adult Immunoblastic Large Cell Lymphoma", "Stage III Adult Lymphoblastic Lymphoma", "Stage III Grade 1 Follicular Lymphoma", "Stage III Grade 2 Follicular Lymphoma", "Stage III Grade 3 Follicular Lymphoma", "Stage III Mantle Cell Lymphoma", "Stage III Marginal Zone Lymphoma", "Stage III Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Burkitt Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Diffuse Mixed Cell Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Diffuse Small Cleaved Cell Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Immunoblastic Large Cell Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Lymphoblastic Lymphoma", "Stage IV Grade 1 Follicular Lymphoma", "Stage IV Grade 2 Follicular Lymphoma", "Stage IV Grade 3 Follicular Lymphoma", "Stage IV Mantle Cell Lymphoma", "Stage IV Marginal Zone Lymphoma", "Stage IV Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma"], "intervention_type": ["Biological", "Biological", "Other", "Other"], "intervention_name": ["rituximab", "aldesleukin", "laboratory biomarker analysis", "pharmacological study"], "description": ["Given IV", "Given SC", "Correlative studies", "Correlative studies"], "arm_group_label": ["Treatment (rituximab and aldesleukin)", "Treatment (rituximab and aldesleukin)", "Treatment (rituximab and aldesleukin)", "Treatment (rituximab and aldesleukin)"], "other_name": ["IDEC-C2B8", "IDEC-C2B8 monoclonal antibody", "Mabthera", "MOAB IDEC-C2B8", "Rituxan", "IL-2", "Proleukin", "recombinant human interleukin-2", "recombinant interleukin-2", "pharmacological studies"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: -
