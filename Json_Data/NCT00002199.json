{"brief_title": "A Phase III Randomized Double-Blind, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of 3TC/ZDV/1592U89 and 3TC/ZDV/IDV in HIV-1 Infected Antiretroviral Therapy-Naive Subjects.", "brief_summary": "To compare the safety, tolerance, early antiviral activity, and durability of antiviral response of the lamivudine (3TC)/zidovudine (ZDV)/1592U89 arm versus the 3TC/ZDV/indinavir (IDV) arm. To determine the effect of the two arms on clinical efficacy as determined by the occurrence of new CDC, defined class B/C events, survival, medical resource utilization, and the development of plasma viral genotypic and phenotypic resistance.", "detailed_description": "In this international study, 550 patients are randomized (225 per arm) to receive Combivir in combination with 1592U89 or indinavir. If after 16 weeks (and every 8 weeks thereafter until week 48) a patient has HIV-1 RNA >= 400 copies/ml (by PCR on two occasions >= 1 week and < 4 weeks apart), the patient has the option to switch to open-label therapy consisting of indinavir, 1592U89, and Combivir.", "condition": "HIV Infections", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Abacavir sulfate", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria Concurrent Medication: Allowed: GM-CSF, G-CSF, and erythropoietin.
