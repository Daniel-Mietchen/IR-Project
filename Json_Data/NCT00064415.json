Subjects of childbearing potential must be using an acceptable method of birth control. - Female subjects who are considered not of childbearing potential must be: (1) documented surgically sterile, OR (2) postmenopausal - Have a primary diagnosis of COPD, which may include components of chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema. Diagnosis can be made during the screening process. - Have a minimum smoking history of 15 pack-years (pack-years = the number of cigarette packs per day times the number of years) - Medical Research Council (MRC) Dyspnea Scale Score >2 - Have a baseline FEV1 <65% of predicted normal value and >0.70 L documented prior to randomization - Have an FEV1/FVC ratio <70% documented prior to randomization. - Have a chest x-ray that is consistent with the diagnosis of COPD and taken <3 months prior to Visit 1. If there is no chest x-ray taken 3 months prior to Visit 1, a chest x-ray will be performed prior to Visit 2. - Be able to complete all study questionnaires and logs reliably EXCLUSION CRITERIA: In order to qualify for participation, subjects must not meet any of the following criteria: - Currently using disallowed medications or will be unable to complete the medication washout periods - Female subject who is pregnant or lactating - Have participated in an investigational drug study within 30 days prior to Visit 1 or who is currently participating in another investigational drug study - Subject whose schedule or travel prevents the completion of all required visits - Subject who is scheduled for in-patient hospitalization, including elective surgery (in-patient or out-patient) during the trial. - Subject with life-threatening/unstable respiratory status, including upper or lower respiratory tract infection, within the previous 30 days prior to Visit 1 - Known history of asthma or any chronic respiratory disease (including a current history of sleep apnea) other than COPD (chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema). - Subject with a blood eosinophil count >5% - Subject with clinically significant cardiac, hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal, endocrine, metabolic, neurologic, or psychiatric disorder that may interfere with successful completion of this protocol - History of cancer except non-melanomatous skin cancer - History of lung resection of more than one full lobe - Subject who requires continuous supplemental oxygen therapy.
