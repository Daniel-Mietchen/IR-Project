{"brief_title": "Amino Acid Therapy for Hot Flashes in Postmenopausal Women", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of the amino acid L-isoleucine in the treatment of hot flashes in postmenopausal women.", "detailed_description": "Hot flashes affect approximately 75% of postmenopausal women. Although hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is highly effective in reducing hot flashes, long-term HRT is associated with increased rates of breast cancer and heart disease. Safe, effective, and well-tolerated hot flash therapies are needed. The amino acids L-methionine and L-isoleucine have produced reductions in hot flash frequency. However, long-term L-methionine therapy may increase cardiovascular risks. This study will evaluate the short-term effects of L-isoleucine therapy. Data from this study will be used to conduct long-term studies in the future. Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive one of two different L-isoleucine doses for 2 weeks. Clinic visits will be made at baseline, Week 1, and Week 10. Participants will record the frequency and severity of their hot flashes in a diary.", "condition": "Hot Flashes", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "L-norleucine", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Postmenopausal - Experience over 5 hot flashes per day Exclusion Criteria: - Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) in the past 2 months", "gender": "Female", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "Accepts Healthy Volunteers", "id": "NCT00081952.xml"}
