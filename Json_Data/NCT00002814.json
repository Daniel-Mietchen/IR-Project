{"brief_title": "Combination Chemotherapy for Patients With Brain Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy using paclitaxel and topotecan, plus G-CSF, in treating patients with glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma that is refractory or recurrent.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate in patients with refractory or recurrent glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma treated with paclitaxel (TAX) and topotecan (TOPO) with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support. II. Determine survival in these patients. III. Describe the toxicity of TAX/TOPO/G-CSF. IV. Evaluate tumor p53 expression in relation to response to TAX/TOPO/G-CSF. OUTLINE: All patients receive paclitaxel, topotecan, and G-CSF every 3 weeks for at least 2 courses and until 2 courses beyond maximum response. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for relapse and survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be entered if there are 1-3 responses in the first 20 patients.", "condition": ["Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors"], "intervention_type": ["Biological", "Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["filgrastim", "paclitaxel", "topotecan hydrochloride"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Biopsy proven glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma Central pathologic review at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, including assay for tumor p53 expression No anaplastic oligodendroglioma No mixed oligodendroastrocytoma Recurrent or progressive disease following radiotherapy documented by CT or MRI within 2 weeks of entry PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: 18 and over Performance status: Karnofsky 60%-100% Hematopoietic: WBC at least 3,000 ANC at least 1,500 Platelets at least 100,000 Hepatic: Bilirubin no greater than 1.0 mg/dL AST/ALT no greater than 2.5 times normal Renal: Creatinine no greater than 1.5 mg/dL Other: No documented sensitivity to E. coli-derived products No major medical or psychiatric illness that would interfere with therapy or compliance with scheduled follow-up No pregnant or nursing women Adequate contraception required of fertile patients PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: No prior taxanes or topoisomerase I inhibitors At least 4 weeks since chemotherapy (6 weeks since nitrosoureas) At least 4 weeks since radiotherapy", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "adult gliosarcoma", "mesh_term": ["Glioblastoma", "Astrocytoma", "Nervous System Neoplasms", "Central Nervous System Neoplasms", "Paclitaxel", "Albumin-Bound Paclitaxel", "Topotecan", "Lenograstim"], "id": "NCT00002814"}
