It is well known that CHD is the leading cause of death among United States Blacks. Among patients with acute myocardial infarction who often present with typical ischemic chest pain, it has been shown that Blacks present more often without chest pain when compared to whites and Hispanics. In addition, more than 25 percent of the myocardial infarction patients have unrecognized infarctions. Morbidity and mortality associated with angina pectoris, cardiovascular disease, and myocardial infarction occurs in United States Blacks at rates which are at least comparable to their white counterparts. Yet, there are limited epidemiological studies designed to identify the determinants of CHD in the Black population. The patients were originally screened to participate in a multicenter clinical trial on 'Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) Following Myocardial Infarction.' Only 28 patients out of 599 screened subjects were eligible for the SAVE study. The baseline data obtained from the 599 screened subjects comprised the database. DESIGN NARRATIVE: Data analysis was performed to: determine the prevalence of coronary heart disease in Blacks presenting with chest pain; identify the correlates of CHD in Blacks; determine the sensitivity and specificity of a Rose questionnaire angina in Blacks; determine the association between the Rose questionnaire angina and CHD manifestations in Blacks, and identify predictive and causal models of CHD. The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the \"End Date\" entered in the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.", "condition": "Myocardial Infarction", "criteria": "No eligibility criteria", "gender": "Male", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "100 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00005410.xml"}
