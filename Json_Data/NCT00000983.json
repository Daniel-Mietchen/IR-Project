{"brief_title": "The Safety of Different Dose Levels of Zidovudine in HIV-Infected Children", "brief_summary": "To evaluate and compare differences in tolerance and side effects associated with two different dosages of zidovudine (AZT) when used to treat children with HIV infection. Other goals are to evaluate and compare the degree of change in neurodevelopmental disease and determine whether there are differences in the rate and degree of toxicities associated with one versus the other dosage. AZT has been shown to decrease the death rate and frequency of opportunistic infections in certain adult patients with symptomatic HIV infection. Thus, it is likely that symptomatic HIV infected children may also benefit from AZT. Studies of the safety and pharmacokinetics (blood levels) in children have indicated that AZT can be given to children in doses that can be tolerated and that can be assumed to be therapeutic. Those currently taking care of infected children no longer feel it is ethical to conduct an AZT/placebo (inactive substance) trial. In addition, given the information learned from studies of adult patients that shows effectiveness of AZT at lower doses, experience with an equivalent lower dose in children needs to be studied.", "detailed_description": "AZT has been shown to decrease the death rate and frequency of opportunistic infections in certain adult patients with symptomatic HIV infection.

All participants are randomized to receive AZT at 1 of 2 doses. Patients are stratified according to whether CD4 cell counts are > or < 500 cells/mm3 as well as whether symptoms are mild to moderate or if patients have lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis (LIP). Medication is dispensed every other week for the first 8 weeks and monthly until week 104, then either monthly or every 3 months. Safety and effectiveness of the treatment program are evaluated at 6-month intervals to assess whether it is appropriate to continue the study as originally designed. Patients are evaluated every 2 weeks for the first 8 weeks, monthly until week 104, every 3 months until week 208, and then every 6 months thereafter.", "condition": ["HIV Infections"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Zidovudine"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria Concurrent Medication: AMENDED: - 03-19-91 Prophylaxis for PCP is recommended according to current practice guidelines.
