{"brief_title": "A Multicenter, Prospective, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial of Three Preparations of Low-Dose Oral Alpha Interferon in HIV-Infected Patients With CD4+ Counts >= 50 and <= 350 Cells/mm3", "brief_summary": "To evaluate the effects of three preparations of low-dose oral interferon alpha (i.e., Alferon LDO, Veldona, and Ferimmune) on HIV symptoms in HIV-infected patients. To evaluate differences in response to oral interferon alpha according to gender, race/ethnicity, and use of antiretrovirals. Previous or ongoing clinical trials to test the efficacy of low-dose oral interferon alpha have produced different results, and it is not clear whether the differences were due to the interferon alpha products used or to problems in the study design. Therefore, three preparations will be compared to evaluate their potential efficacies.", "detailed_description": "Previous or ongoing clinical trials to test the efficacy of low-dose oral interferon alpha have produced different results, and it is not clear whether the differences were due to the interferon alpha products used or to problems in the study design.
