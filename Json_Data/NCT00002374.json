{"brief_title": "A Study of Saquinavir Soft Gelatin Capsules Combined With Other Anti-HIV Drugs in HIV-1 Infected Patients", "brief_summary": "To examine the efficacy of saquinavir SGC (soft gel capsules) in combination with other antiretrovirals in HIV-1 infected patients currently treated with saquinavir HGC (hard gel capsules) measured by the absolute change in plasma HIV-1 RNA during the 24 weeks of study treatment.", "detailed_description": "Eligible patients will be stratified by HIV-1 RNA level into 2 populations: 1) >= 5,000-30,000 HIV-1 RNA, 2) > 30,000 HIV-1 RNA. All patients will be randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms: Arm A - Saquinavir soft gel capsules (SQV SGC) + 2 new nucleoside analogs (reverse transcriptase inhibitors [RTIs]), Arm B - SQV SGC + nelfinavir + stavudine (d4T) or a new RTI, or Arm C - SQV SGC + ritonavir + d4T or a new RTI. All patients will undergo plasma HIV-1 RNA determinations, CD4 lymphocyte counts, hematology and chemistry blood work at baseline, weeks 4, 8, 12, 16 and 24.", "condition": ["HIV Infections"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Ritonavir", "Nelfinavir mesylate", "Saquinavir", "Stavudine"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria Patients must have: - Documented HIV infection. - CD4 > 100 cells/mm3. - Saquinavir HGC-experienced patients (>= 3 months cumulative therapy).
