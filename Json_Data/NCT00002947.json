{"brief_title": "Indium In 111 Pentetreotide in Treating Patients With Refractory Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays and other sources to damage tumor cells. Giving radiation therapy in different ways may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of indium In 111 pentetreotide in treating patients who have refractory cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), toxic effects, and the preliminary antitumor activity of indium In 111 pentetreotide. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive indium In III pentetreotide (OctreoScan) IV on day 1. Imaging is conducted on days 3 and 6. Treatment continues weekly for a total of 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of at least 3 patients receive escalating doses of OctreoScan until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 patients experience dose limiting toxicities. Patients are followed every 3 months for the first year, then every 6 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 35 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors", "Childhood Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis", "Gastrointestinal Carcinoid Tumor", "Head and Neck Cancer", "Intraocular Melanoma", "Islet Cell Tumor", "Kidney Cancer", "Lung Cancer", "Melanoma (Skin)", "Neoplastic Syndrome", "Neuroendocrine Carcinoma of the Skin", "Pheochromocytoma"], "intervention_type": ["Radiation"], "intervention_name": ["indium In 111 pentetreotide"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically proven malignancy with no alternate treatments available Measurable or evaluable progressive disease Somatostatin receptors present on tumor and uptake demonstrated on diagnostic scan with OctreoScan PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: 18 and over Performance status: ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy: At least 3 months Hematopoietic: Platelet count at least 100,000/mm3 Absolute neutrophil count at least 1,500/mm3 Hepatic: Total bilirubin no greater than 2.0 mg/dL Renal: Creatinine clearance at least 40 mL/min Other: No active infections Not HIV positive No coexisting medical condition Not pregnant or nursing Negative pregnancy test Fertile patients must use effective contraception PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: Not specified Chemotherapy: At least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin) Endocrine therapy: Not specified Radiotherapy: At least 4 weeks since prior wide field radiation therapy Surgery: Recovery from prior surgery", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "recurrent neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin", "mesh_term": ["Carcinoma", "Neoplasms", "Lung Neoplasms", "Melanoma", "Head and Neck Neoplasms", "Kidney Neoplasms", "Carcinoid Tumor", "Nervous System Neoplasms", "Central Nervous System Neoplasms", "Neuroendocrine Tumors", "Uveal Neoplasms", "Skin Neoplasms", "Histiocytosis", "Pheochromocytoma", "Carcinoma, Neuroendocrine", "Malignant Carcinoid Syndrome", "Gastrointestinal Neoplasms", "Histiocytosis, Langerhans-Cell", "Adenoma, Islet Cell", "Carcinoma, Merkel Cell", "Somatostatin"], "id": "NCT00002947"}
