{"brief_title": "Physical Performance Measures for Manual Wheelchair Users", "brief_summary": "The project is intended to modify the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) for manual wheelchair users. It will determine if the new measure is a better measure of community independence for manual wheelchair users than the FIM. During the Phase 1 of the study it will then use this new measure to determine whether a home exercise program increases functional independence in wheelchair users. In Phases II and III of the study 120 manual wheelchair users will participate to test and validate the new measure and to test the effectiveness of therapeutic exercise. Subjects will range in age from 20 to 79 yrs. and have a variety of disabilities.", "condition": "Spinal Cord Injury", "intervention_type": "Procedure", "intervention_name": "Performance Measure", "criteria": "Wheelchair users", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "20 Years", "maximum_age": "79 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "Accepts Healthy Volunteers", "id": "NCT00011544.xml"}
