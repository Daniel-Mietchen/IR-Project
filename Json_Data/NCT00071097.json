Four doses of TMC-114/ritonavir will be studied. 300 patients in the United States and Puerto Rico will participate. The duration of the study is 96 weeks. Randomize to one of 4 treatment groups (TMC114/RTV: 400/100 mg qd; 800/100mg qd; 400/100mg bid; 600/100 bid) or control arm for 24 to 48 wks. Optimal dose (TMC114/RTV 600/100mg bid) open label portion of the study. The trial was extended to include 144Wks of treatment.", "condition": ["HIV Infections"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["TMC114/rtv", "TMC114/rtv", "TMC114/rtv", "TMC114/rtv"], "description": ["800mg TMC114/100mg rtv once daily", "400mg TMC114/100mg rtv both twice daily", "400mg TMC114/100mg rtv once daily", "600mg TMC114/100mg rtv twice daily"], "arm_group_label": ["002", "003", "001", "004"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Male or female, age 18 years or older - Documented HIV-1 infection - Stable PI regimen for at least 8 weeks prior to screening - Plasma viral load at screening above 1000 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml - Prior use of more than 1 NRTI for at least 3 months - Prior use of one or more NNRTIs as part of a failing regimen - At least 1 primary PI mutation as defined by the IAS guidelines - Treatment with at least 1 PI for a total of at least 3 months - Patient has given informed consent Exclusion Criteria: - Presence of any currently active AIDS defining illness except stable cutaneous Kaposi's Sarcoma and Wasting syndrome due to HIV infection - Current or past history of alcohol and/or drug abuse which, in the investigator's opinion, would compromise the subject's safety or compliance to the study protocol procedures - NNRTI as part of therapy at screening - Patients on a treatment interruption at screening - Patients for whom an investigational antiretroviral therapy is part of the regimen at screening or the use of any non-antiretroviral investigational agents 90 days prior to screening - Hepatitis A, B, or C.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "99 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "TMC114-C211", "mesh_term": ["HIV Infections", "Ritonavir", "Darunavir"], "id": "NCT00071097"}
