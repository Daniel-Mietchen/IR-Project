{"brief_title": "Low-Dose Decitabine Compared With Standard Supportive Care in Treating Older Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Decitabine may help myelodysplasia cells develop into normal stem cells. It is not yet known if decitabine is more effective than standard supportive care in treating myelodysplastic syndrome. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of low-dose decitabine with that of standard supportive care in treating older patients who have myelodysplastic syndrome.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Compare the efficacy of low-dose decitabine vs standard supportive care, in terms of overall survival, of elderly patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. - Compare the response rate and progression-free survival of patients treated with these regimens. - Determine the toxicity of decitabine in these patients. - Assess the duration of hospitalization and number of blood transfusions in patients treated with these regimens. - Assess the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to cytogenetic risk factors (good vs poor vs intermediate vs unknown), disease (primary myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) vs secondary MDS), and participating center. Patients with a successful cytogenetic exam are also stratified according to overall International Prognostic Scoring System score (intermediate 1 vs intermediate 2 vs high risk). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive decitabine IV over 4 hours every 8 hours for 3 days. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for 4-8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Arm II: Patients receive standard supportive care. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 6 weeks during therapy, every 2 months for 1 year, and then every 3 months thereafter. Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year and then every 3 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 220 patients (110 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 2 years.", "condition": "Myelodysplastic/Myeloproliferative Neoplasms", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "decitabine", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Diagnosis of primary or secondary myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) - Any FAB or WHO criteria cellular type allowed - Bone marrow blast count on aspiration or biopsy of 1 of the following: - No more than 10% with poor cytogenetic risk factors (defined as any numerical or structural abnormality of chromosome 7 and/or complex abnormalities) - 11-20% - 21-30% for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) secondary to MDS (i.e., refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation by FAB classification) - Patients who failed the cytogenetic exam are allowed provided bone marrow blasts are at least 5% and/or 2-3 cytopenias are present - No rapid progression towards full-blown AML - No blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia - No t(8;21) alone or in combination with other abnormalities - Ineligible for intensive chemotherapy (e.g., cytarabine or an anthracycline) PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - 60 and over Performance status - WHO 0-2 Life expectancy - Not specified Hematopoietic - See Disease Characteristics Hepatic - Bilirubin less than 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) - Hepatitis B surface antigen negative Renal - Creatinine less than 1.5 times ULN Cardiovascular - No severe cardiovascular disease - No arrhythmias requiring chronic treatment - No congestive heart failure - No New York Heart Association class III or IV heart disease - No symptomatic ischemic heart disease Other - HIV negative - No active uncontrolled infection - No other malignancy within the past 3 years except basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix within the past 2 years - No prior or concurrent evidence of CNS or psychiatric disorders requiring hospitalization - No psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical condition that would preclude study PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - More than 6 weeks since prior growth factors for primary MDS - No concurrent antiangiogenic drugs (e.g., thalidomide) - No concurrent interleukin, interferon, or anti-thymocyte globulin Chemotherapy - See Disease Characteristics - More than 6 weeks since prior hydroxyurea for primary MDS - No other prior chemotherapy for MDS or AML - Prior chemotherapy for solid tumors or lymphoma (resulting in secondary MDS) allowed Endocrine therapy - No concurrent steroids (except as inhalation therapy) Radiotherapy - Prior radiotherapy for solid tumors or lymphoma (resulting in secondary MDS) allowed Surgery - Not specified Other - More than 6 weeks since prior immunosuppressive agents for primary MDS - No concurrent amifostine - No concurrent cyclosporine - No other concurrent experimental therapies", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "60 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00043134.xml"}
