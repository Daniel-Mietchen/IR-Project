{"brief_title": "Effect of Dose, Safety, Tolerability of a New Smallpox Vaccine in Adults Without Previous Smallpox Vaccination", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and the effectiveness of a new vaccine for the prevention of the disease, smallpox.", "detailed_description": "The objective of this study is to determine the minimum dose of ACAM2000 that is calculated to produce a major cutaneous reaction in at least 90% of a population of healthy adults 18-29 years of age and na\u00efve to smallpox vaccine. Specifically, the objectives of this study are to: 1. Compare the safety and tolerability of four dose levels of ACAM2000 and a standard dose of Dryvax\u00ae in healthy adults 18-29 years of age and na\u00efve to smallpox vaccine. Safety and tolerability will be determined by examination of the local cutaneous reaction, adverse events, physical examinations, vital signs, structured interviews, and laboratory analysis. 2. Determine the immunogenicity of four dose levels of ACAM2000 and a standard dose of Dryvax\u00ae in healthy adults 18-29 years of age by comparing: 1. the proportion of subjects at each dose level who develop a major cutaneous reaction; 2. the proportion of subjects in each treatment group who develop neutralizing antibodies, including the fold-increase in antibody titer between Baseline and Day 30 sera; and the geometric mean vaccinia neutralizing antibody titer on Day 30. 3. Determine the minimum dose of ACAM2000 that is calculated to produce a major cutaneous reaction in at least 90% of a population of healthy adults 18-29 years of age and na\u00efve to smallpox vaccine.", "condition": ["Smallpox"], "intervention_type": ["Biological", "Biological"], "intervention_name": ["Vaccinia virus: ACAM2000 smallpox vaccine", "vaccinia virus (calf lymph): Dryvax"], "description": ["Group 1 dose: 1.0x10-8th PFU/ml Group 2 dose: 2.0x10-8th PFU/ml Group 3 dose: 1.0x10-7th PFU/ml Group 4 dose: 5.0x10-6th PFU/ml", "Group 5 dose: 1.0x10-8th PFU/ml"], "arm_group_label": ["Group 1: ACAM2000 Dose 1", "Group 2: ACAM2000 Dose 2", "Group 3: ACAM2000 Dose 3", "Group 4: ACAM2000 Dose 4", "Group 5: Dryvax\u00ae Vaccine"], "other_name": ["Dryvax\u00ae"], "criteria": "Inclusion criteria: - females must not be pregnant, lactating and must agree to use an effective form of birth control for the 30 days following vaccination or unable to bear children. - agree to be available for the entire study and agree to comply with all requirements.
