{"brief_title": "A Study of Indinavir Taken With or Without DMP 266", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to add DMP 266 to an anti-HIV treatment program of indinavir and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).", "detailed_description": "In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 300 patients are randomized to 1 or 2 reverse transcriptase inhibitors of their choice plus blinded therapy on Arm A or B as follows: Arm A: DMP 266 placebo plus indinavir. Arm B: DMP 266 plus indinavir. After 16 weeks, patients may switch the NRTI portion of their regimen if they meet a treatment failure criterion. After the completion of the 24-week period, patients have the option to continue on open-label DMP 266 and indinavir.", "condition": "HIV Infections", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Efavirenz", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria Patients must have: - CD4+ cell count of at least 50 cells/mm3. - HIV RNA level of at least 10,000 copies/ml by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR, Amplicor test kit) at screening. - Signed, informed consent from parent or legal guardian for patients less than 18 years of age.
