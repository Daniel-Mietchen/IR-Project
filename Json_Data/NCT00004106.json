{"brief_title": "Temozolomide in Treating Patients With Mycosis Fungoides or Sezary Syndrome", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying temozolomide to see how well it works in treating patients with mycosis fungoides or Sezary syndrome that has not responded to previous treatment.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate to temozolomide in patients with relapsed mycosis fungoides or Sezary syndrome. - Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients. - Correlate pretreatment AGT activity in tumor cells with response to this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity for a maximum of 1 year. Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.", "condition": ["Lymphoma"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["temozolomide"], "description": ["Temozolomid will be administered orally at a dose of 150mg/m2/day for 5 days for a total of 4 weeks"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed mycosis fungoides or Sezary syndrome - Stage IB-IVB disease - Must have failed at least one prior systemic therapy - Generalized erythroderma allowed - Measurable disease and at least one indicator lesion OR evaluable disease for erythrodermic patients only - Prior radiotherapy to areas of measurable disease allowed if disease progression is present in the site or if measurable disease is present outside irradiation port PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 and over Performance status: - ECOG 0-2 OR - WHO 0-2 Life expectancy: - At least 3 months Hematopoietic: - WBC at least 3,000/mm^3 - Absolute granulocyte count at least 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 100,000/mm^3 Hepatic: - Bilirubin no greater than 2.2 mg/dL - SGOT or SGPT no greater than 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) - Alkaline phosphatase no greater than 2 times ULN Renal: - Creatinine no greater than 2.0 mg/dL Cardiovascular: - No New York Heart Association class III or IV heart disease - No clinically significant peripheral venous insufficiency Other: - HIV negative - No poorly controlled diabetes mellitus - No acute infection requiring IV antibiotics - No other medical condition that would prevent ingestion or absorption of oral medication - No other neoplasm within the past 5 years except curatively treated squamous cell or basal cell skin cancer, melanoma in situ, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix - Not pregnant or nursing - Fertile patients must use effective contraception PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - At least 4 weeks since prior biologic therapy and recovered - No concurrent growth factors or epoetin alfa Chemotherapy: - At least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy and recovered Endocrine therapy: - At least 4 weeks since prior topical steroids Radiotherapy: - See Disease Characteristics - At least 2 weeks since prior radiotherapy for local control or palliation and recovered Surgery: - Recovered from prior major surgery Other: - No other concurrent investigational drugs", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "recurrent mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome", "mesh_term": ["Lymphoma", "Syndrome", "Mycoses", "Mycosis Fungoides", "Sezary Syndrome", "Temozolomide", "Dacarbazine"], "id": "NCT00004106"}
