Patients randomized to R-Q receive 2 mg of risperidone with dinner the night before testing and placebo with breakfast on the day of testing. After a 6 - 14 day washout period they receive 100 mg quetiapine with dinner the night before their second day of testing and 100 mg with breakfast the day of testing. Those randomized to Q-R receive the same treatments, but in reverse order.
