{"brief_title": "Combination Chemotherapy Plus Radiation Therapy Followed by Surgery in Treating Patients With Stage IIIB Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining chemotherapy and radiation therapy before surgery in treating patients who have stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the incidence of radically resected disease in patients with stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer treated with induction cisplatin, etoposide, and radiotherapy followed by surgical resection. - Determine the toxicity (morbidity and mortality) of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the clinical response rate and pathological response rate in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive induction chemotherapy comprising cisplatin IV on day 1 and etoposide IV on days 1-3. Chemotherapy repeats every 3 weeks for 3 courses. Beginning on day 2 of the second course of chemotherapy, patients undergo induction radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 5-7 weeks. Chemoradiotherapy continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. At 3-6 weeks after completion of the last dose of induction radiotherapy, patients undergo lobectomy or pneumonectomy. Patients are followed at 30 days and 4 months, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27-62 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Lung Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Procedure", "Radiation"], "intervention_name": ["cisplatin", "etoposide", "conventional surgery", "radiation therapy"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically or cytologically confirmed primary stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) - T4, any N, M0 or any T, N3, M0 - No N3 disease due to scalene or supraclavicular lymph node involvement - No primary tumors located in the lower lobe combined with contralateral upper higher mediastinal lymph node involvement - No mixed tumor types with small cell lung cancer - At least 1 unidimensionally measurable target lesion - At least 20 mm by conventional techniques OR - At least 10 mm by spiral CT scan - No pre-existing pleural or pericardial effusion - No CNS involvement by CT scan or MRI PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 to 75 Performance status: - WHO 0-1 Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - Absolute neutrophil count at least 2,000/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 100,000/mm ^3 Hepatic: - Bilirubin no greater than 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) - AST/ALT no greater than 1.5 times ULN - Alkaline phosphatase no greater than 2.5 times ULN Renal: - Creatinine no greater than 1.25 times ULN - Creatinine clearance at least 60 mL/min Cardiovascular: - No clinical evidence of superior vena cava syndrome Pulmonary: - Postoperative FEV1 and KCO greater than 40% predicted - VO2 max greater than 15 mL/min/kg (if postoperative KCO no greater than 40% predicted) Other: - No other primary malignancy except carcinoma in situ of the cervix, adequately treated basal cell skin cancer, or other malignancy treated more than 5 years ago without recurrence (excluding melanoma, breast cancer, or hypernephroma) - No active uncontrolled infection requiring IV antibiotics - No pre-existing sensory neurotoxicity grade 2 or greater - No psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical condition that would preclude study compliance - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - No prior immunotherapy for NSCLC - No concurrent immunotherapy during induction chemoradiotherapy - Concurrent colony stimulating factors allowed Chemotherapy: - No prior chemotherapy for NSCLC Endocrine therapy: - No concurrent anticancer hormonal agents (except corticosteroids for antiemetic prophylaxis) during induction chemoradiotherapy Radiotherapy: - No prior radiotherapy for NSCLC Surgery: - No prior surgery for NSCLC Other: - No other concurrent anticancer drugs during induction chemoradiotherapy", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "75 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer", "mesh_term": ["Lung Neoplasms", "Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung", "Etoposide"], "id": "NCT00021112"}
