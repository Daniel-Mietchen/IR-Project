{"brief_title": "Caspofungin Study for Fungal Infections in Adults in Critical Care Settings", "brief_summary": "Adults admitted to intensive care units are at risk for a variety of complications. One of the most frequent complications is the development of new infections. Infections due to a fungus called Candida are of particular concern. This study will test the possibility that caspofungin, a new therapy for fungal infections, may reduce the rate of Candida infections in subjects at risk.", "detailed_description": "A Randomized, Double-Masked Trial of Caspofungin (50 mg/day) Versus Placebo as Prophylaxis of Invasive Candidiasis in HighRisk Adults in the Critical Care Setting for up to 28 days with observation of primary outcome through 7 days after study therapy. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of caspofungin as prophylaxis for invasive candidiasis in high-risk ICU patients as opposed to those receiving placebo whereas the secondary objectives are as follows: To evaluate the utility of surrogate markers for the diagnosis of invasive candidiasis, to assess the effect of colonization as a risk factor in developing the disease, evaluate the safety of prophylactic caspofungin in subjects who discontinue the study due to drug-related adverse events versus subjects with 1 or more drug-related adverse events and to evaluate the all-cause mortality.", "condition": ["Candidiasis"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Other"], "intervention_name": ["Caspofungin", "Placebo"], "description": ["Caspofungin is an antifungal agent of the echinocandin class of glucan synthase inhibitor.
