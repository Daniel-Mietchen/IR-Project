{"brief_title": "Combination Chemotherapy Plus Rituximab in Treating Patients With Intermediate-Grade or High-Grade Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one chemotherapy drug with rituximab may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of rituximab plus combination chemotherapy in treating patients who have intermediate-grade or high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the rate of complete response and partial response in patients with intermediate or high grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP). II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the disease-free and overall survival, time to response, and time to disease progression in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to the number of risk factors (0-2 vs 3-5). Risk factors include age (no greater than 60 vs greater than 60), tumor stage (II vs III or IV), number of extranodal sites (no more than 1 vs more than 1), performance status (0-1 vs 2-4), and serum LDH level (no greater than normal vs greater than normal). Patients receive rituximab IV on day 1; cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine IV on day 3; and oral prednisone on days 3-7. Patients over 60 also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously beginning on day 4 and continuing until blood counts recover (all other patients receive G-CSF as secondary prophylaxis). Treatment continues every 3 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who respond receive 2 more courses. Patients who have no measurable disease after 6 courses receive rituximab IV once weekly for 4 consecutive weeks. This treatment continues every 6 months for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who have measurable disease after 6 courses of chemotherapy receive 2 more courses for a maximum of 8 courses of CHOP, followed by maintenance therapy with rituximab (as described above). Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 100 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Lymphoma"], "intervention_type": ["Biological", "Biological", "Drug", "Drug", "Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["filgrastim", "rituximab", "cyclophosphamide", "doxorubicin hydrochloride", "prednisone", "vincristine sulfate"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed intermediate or high grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stage II, III, or IV disease B-cell where lymphoid cells are CD20 or CD19 positive No mantle cell, lymphoblastic, or peripheral T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Measurable or evaluable disease No prior treatment for lymphoma No known CNS metastases A new classification scheme for adult non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ.
