{"brief_title": "Tipifarnib and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Unresectable Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Tipifarnib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth and may make them more sensitive to radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Giving tipifarnib together with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of tipifarnib when given together with radiation therapy in treating patients with unresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxic effects of tipifarnib when administered with radiotherapy in patients with unresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Secondary - Determine the 3-month clinical response in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of tipifarnib. Patients receive oral tipifarnib once or twice daily on weeks 1-8. Patients also undergo concurrent radiotherapy daily, 5 days a week, on weeks 2-8. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tipifarnib until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 1, 3, and 6 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 8-18 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-15 months.", "condition": "Pancreatic Cancer", "intervention_type": "Radiation", "intervention_name": "radiation therapy", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed pancreatic cancer - Locally advanced disease - Unresectable disease requiring radiotherapy PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - 18 and over Performance status - ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy - Not specified Hematopoietic - Absolute neutrophil count \u2265 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count \u2265 100,000/mm^3 Hepatic - AST or ALT < grade 2 elevation - Bilirubin \u2264 2.0 mg/dL* NOTE: *Prior biliary stent procedure to normalize bilirubin levels allowed Renal - Creatinine \u2264 1.5 times normal Other - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception - HIV negative - No peripheral neuropathy \u2265 grade 2 - No known allergy to imidazole drugs, including any of the following: - Clotrimazole - Ketoconazole - Miconazole - Econazole - Fenticonazole - Isoconazole - Sulconazole - Tioconazole - Terconazole PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - Not specified Chemotherapy - At least 4 weeks since prior experimental or standard chemotherapy and recovered - No concurrent experimental chemotherapy Endocrine therapy - Not specified Radiotherapy - No prior upper abdominal radiotherapy Surgery - Not specified", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00077519.xml"}
