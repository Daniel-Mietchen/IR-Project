{"brief_title": "Electroacupuncture for Major Depression", "brief_summary": "This study will compare the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of electroacupuncture (EA) and sham electroacupuncture (SA) for the treatment of major depression.", "detailed_description": "Major depression is a common and serious mental illness. It is associated with a markedly lower quality of life, significant functional impairment, and premature death due to suicide or comorbid physical illness. Over the past 50 years, effective and safe treatments for major depression have been developed, including antidepressant pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and electroconvulsive therapy. However, many Americans who suffer from a depressive disorder either do not elect to receive one of these conventional treatments or do not complete an adequate course of treatment. A growing number of Americans with depression are choosing to be treated with complementary and alternative therapies. Acupuncture, in particular, is increasingly being used to treat depression even though only limited data support its safety and efficacy. This study will use a randomized parallel-group design to compare the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of electroacupuncture (EA) and sham electroacupuncture (SA) for the treatment of major depression. Over a 15-month period, 60 adult outpatients with a major depressive disorder of mild or moderate severity (as defined by the DSM-IV) will be randomized to either 12 sessions of EA or SA to be provided over 6 weeks. Safety and symptomatic improvement (as measured with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HRSD]) will constitute the primary outcome measures. Tolerability and functional improvement will constitute secondary outcome measures.", "condition": ["Depression", "Depressive Disorder"], "intervention_type": ["Procedure", "Procedure"], "intervention_name": ["Electroacupuncture", "Sham"], "description": ["For subjects randomized to EA, needles were placed at points GV-20\u2014on the crown of the head and yin tang\u2014on the midline of the forehead roughly at the glabella and treated with electrical stimulation. 30 mm x 0.22 mm sterile stainless steel needles were placed obliquely to a depth of approximately 10 mm and were connected to face-microelectrodes which were connected to the Pantheon Research PENS-Electrostimulator. Electricity was provided at a frequency of 2 Hz and set to a voltage which resulted in the perception of a mild intensity stimulation.", "For subjects randomized to SA, two needles were placed laterally on the scalp, 3 cuns superior to the temporal attachment of the helix of the ear. This point was selected as it does not correspond to any specific meridian acupuncture point. A disabled electrical cable was connected to the needles and the electrostimulator, with light blinking at 2 Hz but no electrical stimulation provided."], "arm_group_label": ["1", "2"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Meet SCID criteria for a Major Depressive Disorder (Single or Recurrent) with a current major depressive episode of mild or moderate severity - Significant symptoms of depression (HRSD > 14) - Ability to communicate in English - Give informed consent in accordance with local IRB regulations Exclusion Criteria: - Personal physician's recommendation against enrollment because the patient is physically unstable or for other reasons - Having been treated with acupuncture for any condition - History of seizure disorder or significant risk factors for a seizure disorder (e.g., history of brain trauma, recent stroke, or brain tumor) - Need to remain on antidepressant or other psychotropic medications - Absence of depressive symptoms severe enough (i.e., HRSD < 14) at the baseline assessments - Significant cognitive impairment, as assessed by a total score on the MMSE < 25.
