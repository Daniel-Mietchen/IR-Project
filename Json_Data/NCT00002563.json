{"brief_title": "SWOG-9208 Quality of Life and Health Status in Patients With Stage I or Stage II Hodgkin's Disease", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Quality-of-life assessment in patients undergoing cancer treatment may help determine the intermediate- and long-term effects of treatment on patients with cancer. PURPOSE: This clinical trial studies the impact of therapy on the health status and quality of life of patients with stage I or stage II Hodgkin's disease who are receiving radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate prospectively the health status and quality of life of patients with Stage I/IIA Hodgkin's disease randomized on protocol SWOG-9133 (CLB-9391) to treatment with subtotal nodal irradiation with vs. without 3 courses of doxorubicin/vinblastine. II. Describe the short-term effects of these treatments on these patients and compare their impact on quality of life (i.e., patient symptom status, health status, fatigue). III. Evaluate the intermediate and long-term effects of these treatments on these patients and compare their impact on quality-of-life outcomes over 5 years. OUTLINE: Quality-of-Life Assessment. Cancer Rehabilitation Evaluation System Short Form, CARES-SF; Symptom and Personal Information Questionnaire (including Symptom Distress Scale, MOS SF-36 Fatigue Scale, MOS SF-36 Health Perception Rating, Demographics); Cover Sheet. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 500 patients will be accrued over 7 years.", "condition": "Psychosocial Effects of Cancer and Its Treatment", "intervention_type": "Procedure", "intervention_name": "quality-of-life assessment", "description": "Evaluate quality of life at prestudy, 6 months after starting treatment on S9133, and annually at 1-7 years after starting treatment on S9133.", "study_pop": "\n      ", "sampling_method": "Non-Probability Sample", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Patients must be eligible for and registered to SWOG-9133 PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Patients must be able to complete the questionnaires in English.
