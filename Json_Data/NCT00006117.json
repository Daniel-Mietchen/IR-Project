{"brief_title": "Gemcitabine and Oxaliplatin in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin in treating patients who have locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective tumor response rate in patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic carcinoma when treated with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin. II. Determine the tolerablility and clinical benefit of this regimen in these patients. III. Evaluate the progression free survival and the overall survival of these patients when treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive gemcitabine IV on day 1 over 1.5 hours and oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 2. Treatment continues every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with locally advanced disease receive 6-8 courses and then may undergo surgery, radiotherapy, and/or additional chemotherapy. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 66 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Pancreatic Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["gemcitabine hydrochloride", "oxaliplatin"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic or locally advanced unresectable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas Measurable disease At least 2 cm in diameter No known brain metastases PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: 18 to 75 Performance status: ECOG 0-2 OR Karnofsky 60-100% Life expectancy: Greater than 12 weeks Hematopoietic: Absolute neutrophil count at least 1,500/mm3 Platelet count at least 100,000/mm3 Hepatic: Bilirubin no greater than 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) Alkaline phosphatase no greater than 5 times ULN Renal: Creatinine no greater than 1.5 times ULN Cardiovascular: Adequate cardiac function Pulmonary: Adequate respiratory function Other: Not pregnant or nursing Fertile patients must use effective contraception No sensitive neuropathy No other active malignancy No uncontrolled hypercalcemia No significant medical or psychiatric condition that would preclude study No psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical condition that would preclude study PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: No prior immunotherapy Chemotherapy: No prior chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: No concurrent corticosteroid use except as antiemetic Radiotherapy: No prior radiotherapy Surgery: Not specified Other: No other concurrent investigational drugs", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "75 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "adenocarcinoma of the pancreas", "mesh_term": ["Pancreatic Neoplasms", "Gemcitabine", "Oxaliplatin"], "id": "NCT00006117"}
