{"brief_title": "Effects of Acute SCI on Colonic Motility & Tone", "brief_summary": "This study will compare individuals with acute SCI to control patients in order to: 1. Determine if there are changes in colonic tone and sensation after SCI by comparing the fasting responses to the postprandial responses; 2. Determine if there are changes in colonic phasic motility after SCI by comparing the fasting responses to the postprandial responses; 3. Determine if colonic motor and sensory function after SCI change over time by repeating these studies six month later in SCI and control patients.", "condition": ["Spinal Cord Injury"], "intervention_type": ["Procedure"], "intervention_name": ["Determine colonic tone"], "criteria": "Acute SCI with impaired colonic tone", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "Spinal cord injury, gastrointestinal motility, gastrointestinal transit", "mesh_term": ["Spinal Cord Injuries"], "id": "NCT00013312"}
