{"brief_title": "S9628 Dexamethasone Plus Interferon Alfa in Treating Patients With Primary Systemic Amyloidosis", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Chemotherapy plus interferon alfa may be effective for primary systemic amyloidosis. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of dexamethasone plus interferon alfa in treating patients who have primary systemic amyloidosis.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Evaluate M protein and organ dysfunction responses and overall and progression-free survival in patients with primary systemic amyloidosis treated with dexamethasone/interferon alfa. - Identify prognostic factors that may relate to response and overall survival in these patients. - Evaluate the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this regimen. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by prior amyloidosis treatment (yes vs no). All patients receive induction therapy with oral dexamethasone on days 1-4, 9-12, and 17-20 every 35 days for a total of 3 courses. Maintenance therapy begins within 5-8 weeks (within 10 weeks if patients undergo stem cell harvest) of initiation of the third course of induction, as follows: oral dexamethasone for 4 days every 4 weeks; and subcutaneous interferon alfa 3 times per week. Patients who achieved less than a 50% reduction in serum M protein or urinary Bence-Jones protein and who experienced less than grade 3 toxicity during induction receive 3 additional courses of pulse dexamethasone concurrently with entry to maintenance therapy and the initiation of interferon alfa. Combination therapy is continued until 2 years from entry; thereafter, interferon is administered alone for at least 3 years, toxicity permitting. Patients with stable disease after 5 years of therapy may discontinue interferon alfa at the discretion of the treating physician. Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and yearly thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients (50 with prior melphalan/prednisone or iododoxorubicin treatment and 50 without) will be entered over 3 years.", "condition": "Multiple Myeloma", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "dexamethasone", "description": "40 mg*/d PO 1 - 4, 9 - 12, 17-20 q 35 days for 3 cycles*", "arm_group_label": "induction and maintenance", "other_name": "decadron", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically diagnosed primary systemic amyloidosis based on the following: - Deposition of fibrillary protein with Congo red positive stain or characteristic electron microscopic appearance - Monoclonal light chain protein (Bence-Jones protein) in serum or urine or immunohistochemical studies - Evidence of tissue involvement other than carpal tunnel syndrome - Diagnostic histologic material available for central pathology review - Confirmation of tissue diagnosis at all sites of organ dysfunction encouraged - No senile, secondary, localized, dialysis-related, or familial amyloidosis - No known therapy-related myelodysplasia PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - Adult Performance status: - SWOG 0-4 Hematopoietic: - Not specified Hepatic: - Not specified Renal: - Not specified Cardiovascular: - No NYHA class IV status Other: - No uncontrolled diabetes - No active peptic ulcer disease - No medical condition that precludes high-dose steroids - No second malignancy within 5 years except: - Adequately treated nonmelanomatous skin cancer - In situ cervical cancer - Adequately treated stage I/II cancer in complete remission - Not pregnant or nursing - Effective contraception required of fertile patients - Blood/body fluid analyses within 14 days prior to registration - Imaging/exams for tumor measurement within 28 days prior to registration - Other screening exams within 42 days prior to registration PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - No prior interferon alfa Chemotherapy - Prior melphalan allowed, but recovered from effects - At least 4 weeks since cytotoxic therapy and recovered Endocrine therapy - Prior prednisone allowed, but recovered from effects - At least 4 weeks since prior glucocorticoids - No prior dexamethasone - No planned or concurrent dexamethasone or other therapy for primary systemic amyloidosis Radiotherapy - Not specified Surgery - Not specified", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00002849.xml"}
