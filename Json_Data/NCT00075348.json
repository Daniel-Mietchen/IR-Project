{"brief_title": "Genetic Study to Identify Gene Mutations in Participants Previously Enrolled in Clinical Trial NCI-99-C-0053 Who Have Von Hippel-Lindau Syndrome or Are at Risk for Von Hippel-Lindau Syndrome", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: The identification of gene mutations in individuals who have or are at risk for von Hippel-Lindau syndrome may allow doctors to better determine the genetic processes involved in the development of cancer. PURPOSE: This genetic study is finding gene mutations in participants with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome or who are at risk for developing von Hippel-Lindau syndrome.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Obtain laboratory identification and confirmation of research results for gene mutations in participants previously enrolled in NCI-99-C-0053 who have von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome or who are at risk for VHL syndrome. - Determine genotype status in these participants. OUTLINE: Participants submit a blood or buccal sample for genetic mutation analysis. Participants may receive genetic counseling and/or the results of genetic testing, if desired. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 260 participants will be accrued for this study.", "condition": "Von Hippel-lindau Syndrome", "intervention_type": "Genetic", "intervention_name": "mutation analysis", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Prior enrollment in the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) Syndrome Epidemiology Study NCI-99-C-0053 - Meets 1 of the following criteria: - Diagnosis of VHL syndrome - At risk of VHL syndrome - Family member of patient with VHL syndrome - VHL syndrome genotype is not known PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - Adult Performance status - Not specified Life expectancy - Not specified Hematopoietic - Not specified Hepatic - Not specified Renal - Not specified PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - Not specified Chemotherapy - Not specified Endocrine therapy - Not specified Radiotherapy - Not specified Surgery - Not specified", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00075348.xml"}
