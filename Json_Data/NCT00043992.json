{"brief_title": "Outdoor Allergen Exposure, Sensitivity, and Acute Asthma", "brief_summary": "To examine the role of outdoor pollen grains and fungal spores in the exacerbation of asthma and to produce forecasting models to predict days of high concentration.", "detailed_description": "Asthma is a growing problem, and outdoor allergens play a role in exacerbation of many cases. A clearer understanding of this role and its magnitude, and a means of controlling the effects of outdoor allergen exposures is needed. We propose Poisson time-series and conditional panel studies to test these hypotheses: 1) The incidence of acute asthma attacks, as measured by urgent care inhalation treatments and hospitalizations for asthma, has a dose-dependent relationship with exposure to specific outdoor allergens; 2) Specific sensitization to outdoor allergens is a risk factor for having an acute attack; and 3) Exposure conditions that lead to acute asthma attacks can be forecast, creating an opportunity to reduce asthma morbidity and mortality ny targeting pretreatment and/or exposure controls.", "condition": "Asthma", "criteria": "Must be a member of the Fallon HMO and be treated for acute asthma exacerbation.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "15 Years", "maximum_age": "50 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00043992.xml"}
