{"brief_title": "A Study of Cetuximab in Patients Who Have Stage IV Colorectal Cancer", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this clinical research study is to learn about the safety of cetuximab in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer, and who may benefit from cetuximab.", "condition": ["Colorectal Neoplasms"], "intervention_type": ["Biological"], "intervention_name": ["Cetuximab"], "description": ["400 mg/m2 loading dose Week 1, followed by 250 mg/m2 weekly until disease progression"], "arm_group_label": ["400 mg/m2"], "other_name": ["Erbitux"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Subjects must have signed an approved informed consent prior to any study procedures. - Subjects with histologically or pathologically confirmed metastatic colorectal cancer, which is EGFR-positive by IHC (may be based on archival samples) - Subjects with ECOG performance status 0, 1 or 2. - Subjects who have failed, either due to lack of efficacy or due to intolerance, all available chemotherapy for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. - Subjects who have failed to meet eligibility criteria for any other existing cetuximab trial. - Subjects must have received at least two chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease OR adjuvant therapy plus one chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease, provided the subject progressed within 6 months of completing their adjuvant therapy. - Prior chemotherapy must have included all of the follow drugs: irinotecan, oxaliplatin, and a fluoropyrimidine. - Subjects adequately recovered from any recent surgery, radiation therapy or chemotherapy. - Subjects accessible for treatment and follow-up. Subjects enrolled in this trial must be treated at the participating center. - Subjects greater or equal to 18 years of age. - Women of childbearing potential must be using an adequate method of contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for up to 4 weeks afterwards. Exclusion Criteria: - Women of childbearing potential who are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method to avoid pregnancy for the entire study period and for up to 4 weeks after the study. - Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. - Women with a positive pregnancy test on enrollment or prior to study drug administration. - Sexually active, fertile men not using adequate birth control. - Subjects with dementia, altered mental status, or any psychiatric condition that would prohibit the understanding or rendering of informed consent. - Subjects with a serious uncontrolled medical disorder that would impair the ability of the patient to receive protocol therapy. - Subjects with a history of uncontrolled angina, arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction within the previous 6 months. - Subjects with any concurrent malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Subjects with a previous malignancy but without evidence of disease for > 5 years will be allowed to enter the trial. - Subjects with any history of severe hypersensitivity reactions and/or anaphylaxis resulting from the administration of protein based therapeutic agents. - Subjects with inadequate hematologic function defined by an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <1,250/mm3, a platelet count <75,000/mm3, and a hemoglobin level <8 g/dL. - Subjects with inadequate hepatic function, defined by a total bilirubin level \u00b33 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and an aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels >5 x ULN. - Subjects with inadequate renal function defined by a serum creatinine level >2.5 x ULN. - Prior cetuximab therapy, prior randomization on a study which includes cetuximab therapy in a treatment arm, or any other prior therapy that targets the EGFR pathway. - A history of prior therapy with a chimerized or murine monoclonal antibody. - Prisoners or subjects who are compulsorily detained (involuntarily incarcerated) for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (e.g., infectious disease) illness must not be enrolled into this study. - A history of cetuximab or therapy that targeted the EGFR receptor. - A history of prior anti-cancer murine monoclonal antibody therapy. - Additional concurrent chemotherapy or other investigational anticancer agents may not be administered to subjects on this study.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "Stage IV colorectal cancer", "mesh_term": ["Colorectal Neoplasms", "Cetuximab"], "id": "NCT00055419"}
