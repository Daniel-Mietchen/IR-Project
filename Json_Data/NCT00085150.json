{"brief_title": "LMB-2 Immunotoxin in Treating Young Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Leukemia or Lymphoma", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: LMB-2 immunotoxin can locate cancer cells and kill them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of LMB-2 immunotoxin in treating young patients with relapsed or refractory leukemia or lymphoma.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of LMB-2 immunotoxin in pediatric patients with CD-25 positive relapsed or refractory leukemia or lymphoma. - Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug, including the terminal elimination serum half-life, area under the curve, volume of distribution, and relationship to disease burden, in these patients. Secondary - Evaluate the immonogenicity of this drug in these patients. - Determine response in patients treated with this drug. - Determine changes in lymphocyte subsets, immunoglobulin levels, serum cytokines, and soluble cytokine receptor levels in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive LMB-2 immunotoxin IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression, neutralizing antibodies (i.e., > 75% of the activity of 1 \u00b5g/mL of LMB-2 immunotoxin), or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete remission (CR) receive 2 additional courses beyond CR. Patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia also receive cytarabine and hydrocortisone intrathecally once monthly concurrent with restaging lumbar punctures. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of LMB-2 immunotoxin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, a total of 12 patients are treated at that dose level. Patients are followed weekly for 1 month and then monthly thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 2-4 years.", "condition": ["Leukemia", "Lymphoma"], "intervention_type": ["Biological"], "intervention_name": ["LMB-2 immunotoxin"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed diagnosis of 1 of the following: - Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, including the following subtypes: - Lymphoblastic lymphoma - Burkitt's lymphoma - Large cell lymphoma - Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma - Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma - Peripheral T-cell lymphoma - Hodgkin's disease - Acute myeloid leukemia - Chronic myelogenous leukemia - Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) - More than 5% blasts in the bone marrow (i.e., M2 marrow classification) - Acute hybrid leukemia, including the following subtypes: - Mixed lineage leukemia - Biphenotypic leukemia - Undifferentiated leukemia - CD25-positive (CD25+) disease, meeting 1 of the following criteria: - More than 15% of malignant cells are CD25+ by immunohistochemistry with anti-CD25 antibody - More than 30% of malignant cells from a site are CD25+ by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis - Measurable or evaluable disease - Relapsed or refractory disease after at least 1 standard chemotherapy regimen AND 1 salvage regimen - No available alternative curative therapies - Ineligible for or refused hematopoietic stem cell transplantation OR disease activity that prohibits the required time to identify a suitable stem cell donor - No CNS leukemia or lymphoma, as evidenced by any of the following criteria: - Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) WBC > 5/\u00b5l AND confirmation of CSF blasts - Cranial neuropathies secondary to underlying malignancy - CNS lymphoma detected by radiological imaging - Prior CNS involvement with no current evidence of CNS malignancy allowed - No isolated testicular ALL PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - 6 months to 21 years Performance status - ECOG 0-3 (\u2265 12 years of age) - Lansky 40-100% (< 12 years of age) Life expectancy - Not specified Hematopoietic - Pancytopenia due to disease allowed - For patients without bone marrow involvement: - Absolute neutrophil count > 1,000/mm^3 - Platelet count > 50,000/mm^3 (transfusion independent) Hepatic - Bilirubin \u2264 2.0 mg/dL - AST and ALT \u2264 5 times upper limit of normal - Hepatitis B surface antigen negative - Hepatitis C antibody negative Renal - Creatinine clearance \u2265 60 mL/min OR - Creatinine, meeting the following age-related criteria: - \u2264 0.8 mg/dL (\u2264 5 years of age) - \u2264 1.0 mg/dL (6 to 10 years of age) - \u2264 1.2 mg/dL (11 to 15 years of age) - \u2264 1.5 mg/dL (> 15 years of age) - Calcium 2.0-2.9 mmol/L Cardiovascular - Ejection fraction \u2265 45% by MUGA OR - Shortening fraction \u2265 28% by echocardiogram Pulmonary - Oxygen saturation \u2265 90% Other - Sodium 130-150 mmol/L - Potassium 3.0-5.5 mmol/L - Magnesium 0.5-1.23 mmol/L - HIV negative - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception - No clinically significant unrelated systemic illness that would preclude study participation - No conditions that would preclude study compliance - No serum that neutralizes > 75% of the activity of 1 \u03bcg/mL of LMB-2 immunotoxin in tissue culture (due to either anti-toxin or anti-mouse immunoglobulin G antibodies) - No active graft-vs-host disease (i.e., off immunosuppression) PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - Prior autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) allowed - At least 100 days since prior allogeneic BMT - At least 1 week since prior colony-stimulating factors (e.g., filgrastim [G-CSF], sargramostim [GM-CSF], or epoetin alfa) Chemotherapy - At least 2 weeks since prior chemotherapy (4 weeks for nitrosoureas) except intrathecal chemotherapy - No other concurrent chemotherapy Endocrine therapy - Concurrent corticosteroids allowed provided the dose has been stable for the past week and does not increase during study treatment - Tapering or discontinuation of steroids allowed Radiotherapy - At least 3 weeks since prior radiotherapy unless < 10% of marrow is irradiated and measurable disease exists outside the radiation port Surgery - Not specified Other - Recovered from all prior therapy - At least 30 days since prior investigational agents - Concurrent oral supplementation to maintain normal electrolyte levels allowed - No concurrent anticoagulation therapy for disease-related conditions - No other concurrent investigational agents", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "21 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "acute undifferentiated leukemia", "mesh_term": ["Lymphoma", "Leukemia", "Immunotoxins", "Antibodies, Monoclonal"], "id": "NCT00085150"}
