{"brief_title": "Thalidomide in Treating Patients With Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Thalidomide may stop the growth of cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of thalidomide in treating patients who have extensive-stage small cell lung cancer that has responded to previous chemotherapy.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the effect of thalidomide on time to disease progression and survival in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer who achieve a complete or partial response to induction chemotherapy. - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients receive oral thalidomide daily beginning 3-4 weeks after completion of induction chemotherapy. Treatment continues for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within approximately 18 months.", "condition": ["Lung Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Procedure"], "intervention_name": ["thalidomide", "adjuvant therapy"], "description": ["oral thalidomide daily beginning 3-4 weeks after completion of induction chemotherapy.
