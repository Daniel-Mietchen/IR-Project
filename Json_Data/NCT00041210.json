{"brief_title": "Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Advanced Hodgkin's Lymphoma", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells. It is not yet known which combination chemotherapy regimen is more effective in treating patients who have advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of two different combination chemotherapy regimens in treating patients who have advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Compare relapse-free and overall survival of patients with previously untreated advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with bleomycin, doxorubicin, etoposide, mechlorethamine, vinblastine, vincristine, and prednisone (Stanford V) vs doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD). - Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I (Stanford V): Patients receive mechlorethamine on weeks 1, 5, and 9; vinblastine and doxorubicin on weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11; etoposide IV over 30-45 minutes for 2 consecutive days on weeks 3, 7, and 11; and vincristine and bleomycin on weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. Patients also receive oral prednisone every other day on days 1-63 followed by a taper on days 64-84. Treatment continues for 12 weeks. - Arm II (ABVD): Patients receive doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6-8 courses. All patients achieving a complete remission or partial remission after chemotherapy undergo involved field radiotherapy if they had initial bulky mediastinal disease, initial nodal masses at least 5 cm in diameter, or initial splenic disease. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.
