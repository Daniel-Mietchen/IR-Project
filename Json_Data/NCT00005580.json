{"brief_title": "Bryostatin + Fludarabine in Treating Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia or Relapsed Indolent Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of bryostatin 1 plus fludarabine in treating patients who have chronic lymphocytic leukemia or relapsed, indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the toxic effects and maximum tolerated dose of bryostatin 1 and fludarabine in patients with symptomatic or advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia or relapsed indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. - Monitor apoptosis, differentiation, and protein kinase C activity in leukemic lymphocytes exposed in vivo to bryostatin 1 and fludarabine. - Observe the antitumor activity of this combination therapy in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are assigned to one of two treatment groups. - Group I: Patients receive bryostatin 1 IV over 24 hours followed by fludarabine IV over 30 minutes daily on days 1-5. - Group II: Patients receive fludarabine IV over 30 minutes daily on days 1-5 followed by bryostatin 1 IV over 24 hours. In both groups, courses repeat every 4 weeks for patients with stable or responding disease. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of fludarabine and bryostatin 1 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD for fludarabine is determined, the dose of bryostatin 1 is escalated. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30-60 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.", "condition": "Lymphoma", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "fludarabine phosphate", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed chronic lymphocytic leukemia - Stage I (symptomatic or with bulky lymphadenopathy) - Stage II, III, or IV - Prior chemotherapy allowed, including fludarabine or other purine nucleoside analog therapy OR - Histologically confirmed indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma - Progressive or relapsed following chemotherapy - Includes the following histologies: - B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/prolymphocytic leukemia/lymphomas - Lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma (Waldenstrom's)/immunocytoma - Mantle cell lymphoma - Follicular lymphoma - Small cell - Mixed small and large cell - Diffuse (predominately small cell type) - Marginal zone B-cell lymphoma - Extranodal (MALT-type with or without monocytoid B-cells) - Provisional subtype: nodal (with or without monocytoid B-cells) - Provisional entity: splenic marginal zone lymphoma (with or without villous lymphocytes) - Hairy cell leukemia - Peripheral T-cell and NK-cell neoplasms - T-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/polylymphocytic leukemia - Large granular lymphocyte leukemia - T-cell type - NK-cell type - Mycosis fungoides/Sezary's syndrome (cutaneous T-cell lymphoma) - No CNS disease PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 and over Performance status: - Zubrod 0-2 Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - Granulocyte count at least 1,000/mm3 - Platelet count at least 75,000/mm3 - Hemoglobin at least 8 g/dL - Coombs negative Hepatic: - AST/ALT no greater than 2.5 times upper limit of normal - Bilirubin no greater than 2 mg/mL Renal: - Creatinine clearance at least 40 mL/min Other: - No concurrent neurologic condition - No other concurrent medical condition that would preclude study - Not pregnant or nursing - Fertile patients must use effective contraception during and for 3 months after study PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - No concurrent systemic immunoglobulin therapy - No prior bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplantation Chemotherapy: - See Disease Characteristics - At least 3 weeks since prior systemic chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: - No concurrent systemic glucocorticoid therapy Radiotherapy: - Not specified Surgery: - Not specified Other: - No other concurrent anticancer therapy", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00005580.xml"}
