{"brief_title": "Rituximab in Treating Patients With Hodgkin's Lymphoma", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of rituximab in treating patients who have Hodgkin's lymphoma.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the partial and complete response rates in patients with untreated or recurrent/refractory lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with rituximab. - Determine the efficacy of this regimen in terms of duration of disease free survival and time to progression in this patient population. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive rituximab IV over several hours once a week for 4 weeks followed by maintenance rituximab at 6, 12, and 18 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study within approximately 18 months.", "condition": ["Lymphoma", "Hodgkin Lymphoma (Category)"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Rituximab"], "description": ["An initial course of rituximab at 375 mg/m2 weekly for 4 consecutive weeks. Patients who have an objective response or stable disease to the initial course will receive additional courses of rituximab treatment every six months for 4 courses."], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:- Patients must have lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's disease that is of B-cell lineage and expresses the CD 20 antigen. Patients are eligible with either untreated disease or refractory/relapsed disease. - Patients must be >= 3 years. - Patients must have a performance status of 0-2. - Patients must have an ANC > 1500/ml and a platelet count > 50,000/ml. - A biopsy or fine needle aspirate sample must show expression of the CD20 antigen on the L adnH cells. - Patients must have measurable disease (at least one tumor mass measuring >1.0 cm in largest dimension). - Patients must have no evidence of active infection. - Patients must read and sign IRB approved informed consent. - Adequate renal function as indicated by serum creatinine (Cr) < 1.5X the upper limit of normal. - Adequate liver function as indicated by alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, AST, and ALT < 2X upper limit of normal unless related to primary disease. - Patients at high risk of HBV infection should be screened prior to enrollment. Exclusion Criteria:- Concomitant or recent treatment with radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Four weeks must pass from radiotherapy or cytotoxic therapy to enroll (six weeks for nitrosourea compounds). - Major surgery, other than diagnostic surgery, within 4 weeks. - Female patients must be of non-childbearing potential or using adequate contraception with a negative pregnancy test at study entry. - Serious non-malignant disease (e.g., congestive heart failure, or active uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infections), or other conditions which, in the opinion of the investigator and/or sponsor, would compromise other protocol objectives. - Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half-lives (of the study drug with the longest half-life) prior to entry into the study, whichever is longer. - Evidence of other active malignancies other than cured carcinomas in situ of the cervix or basal cell carcinoma of the skin. - Life expectancy<= 12 weeks. - Concurrent treatment with prednisone or other systemic steroid medication. - Active HBV infection or hepatitis.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "3 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "mesh_term": ["Lymphoma", "Hodgkin Disease", "Rituximab"], "id": "NCT00003820"}
