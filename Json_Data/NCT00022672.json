Patients were randomized to receive either anastrazole 1 mg per os (po) daily, or anastrazole 1 mg po daily + a loading dose of Herceptin\u00ae 4 mg/kg intravenous (iv) followed by weekly doses of Herceptin\u00ae 2 mg/kg iv. The anticipated time on study treatment was until disease progression, and the target sample size was 100-500 individuals.", "condition": "Breast Cancer", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "anastrazole (Arimidex\u00ae)", "description": "1 mg tablet taken orally daily", "arm_group_label": "anastrozole", "other_name": "Arimidex\u00ae", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - postmenopausal women; - metastatic breast cancer suitable for endocrine therapy; - positive hormone receptor status; - Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression.
