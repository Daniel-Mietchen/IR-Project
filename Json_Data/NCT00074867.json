Exclusion Criteria: - No prior exposure to mouse antibodies or prior VEGF or VEGF receptor targeted treatment or other anti-angiogenic-directed, anti-cancer treatment including thalidomide. - No prior consolidation therapy with cytotoxic agents for ovarian cancer. - Continuation of hormone replacement therapy is permitted. - No requirement for concomitant anticoagulant therapy. - Administration of low dose anticoagulants for maintenance of central venous access is permitted.No chronic oral or intravenous steroid use.", "gender": "Female", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "mesh_term": ["Neoplasms", "Fallopian Tube Neoplasms", "Ovarian Neoplasms", "Peritoneal Neoplasms"], "id": "NCT00074867"}
