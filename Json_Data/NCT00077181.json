{"brief_title": "3-AP and High-Dose Cytarabine in Treating Patients With Advanced Hematologic Malignancies", "brief_summary": "Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cytarabine, work in different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. 3-AP may help cytarabine kill more cancer cells by making them more sensitive to the drug. This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of 3-AP when given with high-dose cytarabine in treating patients with advanced hematologic malignancies", "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of 3-AP (Triapine) administered with high-dose cytarabine in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the clinical activity of this regimen in these patients. II. Determine the effect of treatment with 3-AP (Triapine) on intracellular levels of cytarabine in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of 3-AP (Triapine). Patients receive high-dose cytarabine IV over 2 hours on days 1-5 and 3-AP (Triapine) IV over 2 hours on days 2-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients in each stratum receive escalating doses of 3-AP (Triapine) until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed for up to 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6-48 patients (3-24 per stratum) will be accrued for this study within 15-24 months.", "condition": ["Accelerated Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia", "Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia With 11q23 (MLL) Abnormalities", "Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia With Inv(16)(p13;q22)", "Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia With t(15;17)(q22;q12)", "Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia With t(16;16)(p13;q22)", "Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia With t(8;21)(q22;q22)", "Blastic Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia", "Recurrent Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia", "Recurrent Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia", "Relapsing Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia", "Secondary Acute Myeloid Leukemia"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Other"], "intervention_name": ["cytarabine", "triapine", "laboratory biomarker analysis"], "description": ["Given IV", "Given IV", "Correlative studies"], "arm_group_label": ["Treatment (cytarabine and triapine)", "Treatment (cytarabine and triapine)", "Treatment (cytarabine and triapine)"], "other_name": ["ARA-C", "arabinofuranosylcytosine", "arabinosylcytosine", "Cytosar-U", "cytosine arabinoside", "3-AP", "OCX-191"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Histologically confirmed diagnosis of 1 of the following hematologic malignancies: - Relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) - Relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia - Secondary AML, including AML arising from antecedent hematologic diseases, such as myelodysplastic syndromes or myeloproliferative disorders OR therapy-related AML - Chronic myeloid leukemia in accelerated or blast phase - Refractory to standard therapy or no standard therapy exists - No known brain metastases - Performance status - CALGB 0-2 - Performance status - Karnofsky 60-100% - No G6PD deficiency - Bilirubin < 2.0 mg/dL (unless due to Gilbert's syndrome) - AST and ALT < 2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) - Creatinine < 1.5 times ULN - No symptomatic congestive heart failure - No unstable angina pectoris - No cardiac arrhythmia - No pulmonary disease requiring oxygen - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception - No prior allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biological composition to study drugs - No neuropathy - No ongoing or active infection - No psychiatric illness or social situation that would preclude study compliance - No other concurrent uncontrolled illness - No concurrent biologic agents - At least 72 hours since prior hydroxyurea - At least 2 weeks since other prior chemotherapy (6 weeks for mitomycin or nitrosoureas) - No other concurrent chemotherapy - At least 2 weeks since prior radiotherapy - No concurrent radiotherapy - Recovered from all prior therapy - At least 4 weeks since prior investigational agents - No other concurrent investigational therapy - No other concurrent anticancer therapy - No concurrent combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-positive patients", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "mesh_term": ["Leukemia", "Leukemia, Myeloid", "Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute", "Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma", "Leukemia, Lymphoid", "Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive", "Blast Crisis", "Leukemia, Myeloid, Accelerated Phase", "Cytarabine"], "id": "NCT00077181"}
