{"brief_title": "Biological Therapy in Treating Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Biological therapies use different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop cancer cells from growing. Combining different types of biological therapies may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of biological therapy in treating patients who have myelodysplastic syndrome.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the frequency of hematologic responses in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome treated with anti-thymocyte globulin and tumor necrosis factor receptor IgG chimera. - Correlate phenotypic, cytogenetic, and functional disease characteristics with treatment responses in these patients. - Determine the safety of this treatment regimen in this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients receive anti-thymocyte globulin IV over 8 hours daily for 4 days followed by tumor necrosis factor receptor IgG chimera subcutaneously twice weekly for 16 weeks. Patients are followed at 8, 16, and 20 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Leukemia", "Myelodysplastic Syndromes"], "intervention_type": ["Biological", "Biological"], "intervention_name": ["anti-thymocyte globulin", "etanercept"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome with no greater than 20% marrow blasts with: - Single or multilineage cytopenia (neutrophils less than 2,000/mm^3 and/or platelet count less than 100,000/mm^3 and/or reticulocyte count less than 18,000/mm^3) OR - Transfusion requirement of at least 2 units packed red blood cells per month and one of the following: - Suitable marrow donor unavailable - Ineligible for a transplantation protocol - Unwilling to proceed with transplantation - No chronic myelomonocytic leukemia PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - Any age Performance status: - Not specified Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - See Disease Characteristics Hepatic: - Not specified Renal: - Not specified Other: - No other severe disease that would preclude study - No active severe infection (e.g., pneumonia or septicemia) or severe infections within the past 2 weeks PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - See Disease Characteristics - At least 4 weeks since prior hematopoietic growth factors - No concurrent hematopoietic growth factors Chemotherapy: - At least 4 weeks since prior cytotoxic therapy - No concurrent cytotoxic therapy Endocrine therapy: - Not specified Radiation therapy: - Not specified Surgery: - Not specified Other: - At least 4 weeks since prior immunomodulatory therapy - No concurrent immunomodulatory therapy", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "childhood myelodysplastic syndromes", "mesh_term": ["Syndrome", "Myelodysplastic Syndromes", "Preleukemia", "Antilymphocyte Serum", "Etanercept"], "id": "NCT00005853"}
