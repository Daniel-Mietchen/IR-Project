{"brief_title": "Determine the Efficacy, Safety and Tolerability of Denosumab (AMG 162) in the Treatment of Postmenopausal Women With Low Bone Mineral Density", "brief_summary": "To determine the effect of denosumab treatment compared with placebo over 12 months on bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine in postmenopausal women with low BMD. The clinical hypothesis is that denosumab subcutaneous injections administered every 3 or 6 months for 12 months will significantly increase lumbar spine bone mineral density and will be well tolerated.", "condition": ["Low Bone Mineral Density"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Placebo", "Denosumab", "Alendronate"], "description": ["Placebo subcutaneous injection", "Denosumab for subcutaneous injection", "Alendronate 70 mg tablets"], "arm_group_label": ["Placebo", "Denosumab 6 mg every 3 months", "Denosumab 14 mg every 3 months", "Denosumab 30 mg every 3 months", "Denosumab 14 mg every 6 months", "Denosumab 60 mg every 6 months", "Denosumab 100 mg every 6 months", "Denosumab 210 mg every 6 months", "Alendronate 70 mg"], "other_name": ["AMG 162", "Prolia", "Fosamax"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria - women not more than 80 years of age on date of randomization - \u2265 1 year postmenopausal on date of randomization - ambulatory - if \u2264 60 years of age, or had or would require a bilateral oophorectomy, serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) > 50 mU/mL or serum estradiol < 20 pg/mL - low BMD (BMD T-score \u2264 -1.8 at any 1 of the following sites: lumbar spine, femoral neck, or total hip; BMD T-scores must not have been < -4.0 at the lumbar spine or - 3.5 at the femoral neck or total hip) - before any study-specific procedure, including the screening dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan, gave informed consent for participation in the study.
