{"brief_title": "Gefitinib in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Thyroid Cancer That Did Not Respond to Iodine Therapy", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Gefitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of gefitinib in treating patients who have locally advanced or metastatic thyroid cancer that did not respond to iodine therapy.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the all-measurable-disease response rate in patients with iodine-refractory locally advanced or metastatic thyroid cancer treated with gefitinib. Secondary - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. - Determine progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients receive oral gefitinib once daily. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Head and Neck Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["gefitinib"], "description": ["Taken orally once a day"], "arm_group_label": ["Gefitinib"], "other_name": ["ZD1839"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically or cytologically confirmed thyroid cancer - Metastatic or locally advanced disease - Not amenable to OR unresponsive or refractory to local therapy and/or radioactive iodine, depending on cell type - Medullary and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas are considered unresponsive on the basis of histology alone - Well-differentiated papillary or follicular thyroid carcinomas are considered refractory if there is no evidence of uptake on radioactive iodine scanning OR the tumor progresses despite treatment with radioactive iodine - Measurable disease PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - 18 and over Performance status - ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy - Not specified Hematopoietic - Absolute neutrophil count \u2265 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count \u2265 75,000/mm^3 Hepatic - AST or ALT \u2264 3 times normal - Bilirubin \u2264 1.5 times normal - No unstable or uncompensated hepatic disease Renal - Creatinine \u2264 Common Toxicity Criteria grade 2 - No unstable or uncompensated renal disease Cardiovascular - No unstable or uncompensated cardiac disease Pulmonary - No clinically active interstitial lung disease - Chronic, stable, asymptomatic radiographic changes allowed - No unstable or uncompensated respiratory disease Other - No known severe hypersensitivity to gefitinib or any of its excipients - No other severe or uncontrolled systemic disease - No other significant clinical disorder or laboratory finding that would preclude study participation - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - Not specified Chemotherapy - No concurrent chemotherapy Endocrine therapy - Not specified Radiotherapy - See Disease Characteristics - No concurrent local-regional radiotherapy to a primary disease site - No concurrent radiotherapy to a bony or CNS metastasis Surgery - Completely healed after prior oncologic or other major surgery Other - Recovered from all prior anticancer therapy - More than 30 days since prior non-approved or investigational drugs - No concurrent use of any of the following agents: - Phenytoin - Carbamazepine - Barbiturates - Rifampin - Phenobarbital - Hypericum perforatum (St. John's wort) - Systemic retinoids - Cyclosporine - Verapamil - Diltiazem - Nicardipine - Nifedipine - Nitrendipine - Erythromycin - Theophylline - Ketoconazole - Itraconazole - Antihistamines (e.g., terfenadine or astemizole) - No concurrent grapefruit or grapefruit juice - No other concurrent systemic anticancer treatment", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "thyroid gland medullary carcinoma", "mesh_term": ["Head and Neck Neoplasms", "Thyroid Diseases", "Thyroid Neoplasms", "Gefitinib"], "id": "NCT00095836"}
