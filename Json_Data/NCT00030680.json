{"brief_title": "Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Aggressive Fibromatoses", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of radiation therapy in treating patients who have aggressive fibromatoses.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of moderate-dose radiotherapy, in terms of local control, in patients with aggressive fibromatoses. - Determine the acute and late side-effects of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5.5 weeks for a total of 56 Gy in 28 fractions. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.", "condition": ["Desmoid Tumor"], "intervention_type": ["Radiation"], "intervention_name": ["radiation therapy"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed aggressive fibromatoses arising in any site - Primary, recurrent, or progressive disease that is inoperable or requires a major operation resulting in a large functional or cosmetic deficit or mutilation - Progressive disease defined as at least 20% increase in tumor size on 2 MRI scans within 1 year after any prior therapy except radiotherapy OR - Incompletely resected tumor with gross residual disease not suitable for further surgery - Resected within the past 3 months - Lesions must be suitable for radiotherapy - No bulky intra-abdominal disease in close relation to small bowel - Measurable disease PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 16 and over Performance status: - Not specified Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - Not specified Hepatic: - Not specified Renal: - Not specified Other: - No conditions that would preclude study follow-up PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - Not specified Chemotherapy: - Prior chemotherapy allowed - No concurrent chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: - Prior endocrine therapy allowed - No concurrent endocrine therapy Radiotherapy: - See Disease Characteristics - No prior radiotherapy to indicator lesion Surgery: - See Disease Characteristics - Prior surgery allowed Other: - No prior isolated limb perfusion with tumor necrosis factor - No concurrent isolated limb perfusion with tumor necrosis factor", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "16 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "desmoid tumor", "mesh_term": ["Fibromatosis, Aggressive", "Fibroma"], "id": "NCT00030680"}
