Determine the effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on treatment refractory auditory hallucinations of patients with schizophrenia.", "detailed_description": "PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Group I: Patients receive 9 sessions of active transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) which consists of 8 minutes of rTMS during session 1, 12 minutes duration during session 2, and 16 minutes duration during sessions 3-9. The total duration of stimulation is 132 minutes. Each session was given on a separate day and in general each session occurred on consecutive days with the exception of weekends. Group II: Patients receive 9 sessions of sham stimulation, which consists of 8 minutes of sham stimulation during session 1, 12 minutes duration sham stimulation during session 2, and 16 minutes duration sham stimulation during sessions 3-9. The total duration of sham stimulation is 132 minutes. Each session was given conducted on a separate day and in general each session occured on consecutive days with the exception of weekends.
