{"brief_title": "Paclitaxel and Estramustine in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining paclitaxel and estramustine in treating patients who have relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate, time to treatment failure, and overall survival of patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with paclitaxel and estramustine. II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral estramustine 2-3 times daily on days 1-3 and paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on day 2 on weeks 1-6. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for at least 1 course in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete or partial response continue therapy for at least 3 courses or for 1 course after achieving maximum response. Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-35 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Lymphoma"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["estramustine phosphate sodium", "paclitaxel"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed relapsed or refractory intermediate, high-grade, or transformed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Received 1-3 prior treatment regimens (cytoreductive chemotherapy followed by high-dose therapy with stem cell support considered 1 regimen) Measurable disease A new classification scheme for adult non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ.
