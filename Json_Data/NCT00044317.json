{"brief_title": "Health Effects of Particulate Acids in Late Adolescence", "brief_summary": "This study was designed to follow a group of adolescents who were previously examined by questionnaire and pulmonary function tests when they were aged 8-10 years old. Approximately 50% of the population in 10 towns were seen again at age 17-18. Questionnaires and pulmonary function were repeated. The hypotheses being tested related to whether the previously seen levels of pulmonary function that were related to pollution levels in the towns persisted as the lungs of these children grew and whether dietary antioxidants influences level of attained pulmonary function.", "condition": ["Airway Obstruction", "Cough"], "criteria": "Children seen in a previous study at ages 8-10 from selected cities", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "16 Years", "maximum_age": "19 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "Accepts Healthy Volunteers", "keyword": "lung growth", "mesh_term": ["Airway Obstruction"], "id": "NCT00044317"}
