{"brief_title": "Alemtuzumab in Treating Patients With Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as alemtuzumab, can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well alemtuzumab works in treating patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the objective response in patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia treated with alemtuzumab. - Determine the time to treatment failure in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive alemtuzumab IV over 2 hours on days 1, 3, and 5 of weeks 1-6 (course 1) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with a complete response undergo observation. Patients with stable disease or a minor or partial response receive an additional course of alemtuzumab, administered as in course 1, on weeks 7-12. Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 13-27 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": "Lymphoma", "intervention_type": "Biological", "intervention_name": "alemtuzumab", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Diagnosis of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma) - Immunoglobulin (Ig) M, IgG, and IgA paraprotein - Measurable monoclonal paraprotein - Failed at least 1 prior first-line therapy (alkylator agent, nucleoside analogue, or rituximab) - CD52-positive tumor determined by either bone marrow immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - Over 18 Performance status - ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy - At least 6 months Hematopoietic - Absolute neutrophil count \u2265 500/mm^3 - Platelet count \u2265 25,000/mm^3 Hepatic - SGOT \u2264 2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) - Bilirubin \u2264 2.5 times ULN Renal - Creatinine \u2264 2.5 mg/dL (> 2.5 mg/dL allowed if due to disease) Other - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective double-method contraception during and for 6 months after study participation - No serious comorbid disease - No uncontrolled bacterial, fungal, or viral infection - No other active malignancy PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - See Disease Characteristics - No prior alemtuzumab - More than 3 months since other prior monoclonal antibody therapy Chemotherapy - See Disease Characteristics - More than 21 days since prior chemotherapy Endocrine therapy - More than 21 days since prior steroid therapy Radiotherapy - More than 21 days since prior radiotherapy Surgery - Not specified", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00081068.xml"}
