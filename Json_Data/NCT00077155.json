{"brief_title": "Cilengitide (EMD 121974) in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors or Lymphoma", "brief_summary": "This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of EMD 121974 in treating patients with solid tumors or lymphoma. Cilengitide (EMD 121974) may stop the growth of cancer cells by stopping blood flow to the cancer", "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the dose-limiting toxicity, maximum feasible dose, and recommended phase II dose of cilengitide (EMD 121974) in patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma. II. Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. II. Determine the antineoplastic activity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive cilengitide (EMD 121974) IV continuously on weeks 1-4. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of EMD 121974 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.", "condition": ["AIDS-related Peripheral/Systemic Lymphoma", "AIDS-related Primary CNS Lymphoma", "Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma", "Angioimmunoblastic T-cell Lymphoma", "Extranodal Marginal Zone B-cell Lymphoma of Mucosa-associated Lymphoid Tissue", "Intraocular Lymphoma", "Nodal Marginal Zone B-cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Burkitt Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Diffuse Mixed Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Diffuse Small Cleaved Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Immunoblastic Large Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Lymphoblastic Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma", "Recurrent Cutaneous T-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Recurrent Grade 1 Follicular Lymphoma", "Recurrent Grade 2 Follicular Lymphoma", "Recurrent Grade 3 Follicular Lymphoma", "Recurrent Mantle Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Marginal Zone Lymphoma", "Recurrent Mycosis Fungoides/Sezary Syndrome", "Recurrent Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma", "Splenic Marginal Zone Lymphoma", "Stage III Adult Burkitt Lymphoma", "Stage III Adult Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma", "Stage III Adult Diffuse Mixed Cell Lymphoma", "Stage III Adult Diffuse Small Cleaved Cell Lymphoma", "Stage III Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Stage III Adult Immunoblastic Large Cell Lymphoma", "Stage III Adult Lymphoblastic Lymphoma", "Stage III Cutaneous T-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Stage III Grade 1 Follicular Lymphoma", "Stage III Grade 2 Follicular Lymphoma", "Stage III Grade 3 Follicular Lymphoma", "Stage III Mantle Cell Lymphoma", "Stage III Marginal Zone Lymphoma", "Stage III Mycosis Fungoides/Sezary Syndrome", "Stage III Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Burkitt Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Diffuse Mixed Cell Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Diffuse Small Cleaved Cell Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Immunoblastic Large Cell Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Lymphoblastic Lymphoma", "Stage IV Cutaneous T-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Stage IV Grade 1 Follicular Lymphoma", "Stage IV Grade 2 Follicular Lymphoma", "Stage IV Grade 3 Follicular Lymphoma", "Stage IV Mantle Cell Lymphoma", "Stage IV Marginal Zone Lymphoma", "Stage IV Mycosis Fungoides/Sezary Syndrome", "Stage IV Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma", "Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["cilengitide"], "arm_group_label": ["Treatment (cilengitide)"], "other_name": ["EMD 121974"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: -
