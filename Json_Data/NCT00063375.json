{"brief_title": "Interactive Computer Treatment for Panic Disorder", "brief_summary": "This study will develop an interactive computer-based version of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and compare its effectiveness to book-based CBT for the treatment of panic disorder.", "detailed_description": "Panic disorder (PD) is a highly prevalent and debilitating condition. Unfortunately, many people with PD go untreated because of the high cost and low availability of treatment. Research shows that CBT is an effective treatment for PD. When administered as a self-help, computer based treatment, CBT may provide a less expensive, more engaging treatment for PD. Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive computer based treatment, book based treatment, or no treatment for 10 weeks. After these 10 weeks, symptoms of anxiety and depression will be measured with patient interviews, scales, and questionnaires.", "condition": ["Panic Disorder"], "intervention_type": ["Behavioral"], "intervention_name": ["Computer Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - DSM-IV diagnosis of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia Exclusion Criteria: - Change in medication type or dose 12 weeks prior to study entry - Suicidal - Current substance abuse - Current or past schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or organic mental disorder.
