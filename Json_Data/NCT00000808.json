{"brief_title": "A Phase I Study of Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Nevirapine in HIV-1 Infected Pregnant Women and Neonates Born to HIV-1 Infected Mothers", "brief_summary": "To determine the bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, and short-term safety and tolerance of nevirapine in HIV-1 infected pregnant women and their newborns when nevirapine is given to the mother during active labor, and when their neonates are dosed during the first week of life. To determine the short-term safety profile of mothers receiving zidovudine (AZT) who received nevirapine during active labor, and their neonates who received no dose, a single dose, or multiple doses of nevirapine and who are receiving AZT during the first 6 weeks of life. Treatment of HIV-1 infected pregnant women during active labor may result in therapeutic levels of nevirapine in the neonate at the time of exposure to HIV-1 during parturition, decreasing the neonate's risk of infection.", "detailed_description": "Treatment of HIV-1 infected pregnant women during active labor may result in therapeutic levels of nevirapine in the neonate at the time of exposure to HIV-1 during parturition, decreasing the neonate's risk of infection. Pregnant women in active labor receive single doses of oral nevirapine. The neonates of the first 4-6 (PER AMENDMENT 8/27/96, was 4) mothers receive no drug, while the neonates of the second 4-6 (PER AMENDMENT 8/27/96, was 4) patient cohort receive a single dose of nevirapine. If neonatal antiviral levels of nevirapine are not sustained for 7 days after the single dose, a third cohort of 4-6 (PER AMENDMENT 8/27/96, was 4) pregnant women will receive a single dose of nevirapine and their neonates will receive multiple doses of nevirapine to maintain an antiviral effect for 7 days.", "condition": ["HIV Infections", "Pregnancy"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Nevirapine"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria Concurrent Medication: Allowed: - AZT (mothers and neonates). - Oral asthma inhalers (mothers).
