The Base study follow-up period continued through approximately Month 48. The base study was extended in protocol V501-019-10 (EXT1). Participants who received placebo and participants who received only 1 dose of qHPV vaccine in the Base Study were offered a complete, open-label, 3-dose qHPV vaccine regimen (administered at EXT1 Day 1, Month 2 and Month 6). Participants who received only 2 doses of qHPV vaccine in the base study were offered a single additional dose of qHPV vaccine (administered at EXT1 Day 1). Participants were followed to EXT1 Month 7. A Long Term Follow-Up (LTFU) extension study V501-019-21 (EXT2) was added to observe the long term safety, effectiveness, and immunogenicity of qHPV vaccine in approximately 1,600 women who participated in the Base Study at sites in Colombia. Data were collected over a period of 6-10 years following participant's enrollment in the original Base Study.", "condition": "Human Papillomavirus Recombinant Vaccine Quadrivalent, Types 6, 11, 16, 18", "intervention_type": "Biological", "intervention_name": "Comparator: Placebo", "description": "Placebo intramuscular injection in three 0.5 mL doses over 6 months.", "arm_group_label": "Placebo in Base Study", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - No history of genital warts, vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN), or vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VaIN) - Not pregnant and agrees to use effective contraception through Month 7 of the study - Additional criteria applied Exclusion Criteria: - Pregnant - Concurrently enrolled in a clinical study involving collection of cervical specimens - Previously received any HPV vaccine - History of severe allergic reaction that required medical intervention - Received any immune globulin or blood-derived products within 3 months prior to the first study injection - History of splenectomy, known immune disorders, or receiving immunosuppressives - Immunocompromised or diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection - Known thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorders that could contraindicate intramuscular injections - History of recent or ongoing alcohol or drug abuse - Prior treatment for genital warts, VIN, or VaIN - History of cervical disease (ie, surgical treatment for cervical lesions) - Hysterectomy", "gender": "Female", "minimum_age": "24 Years", "maximum_age": "45 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "Accepts Healthy Volunteers", "id": "NCT00090220.xml"}
