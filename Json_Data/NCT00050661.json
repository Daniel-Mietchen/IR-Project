{"brief_title": "To Study the Use of Humanized CD25 in Preventing the Relapse of Psoriasis Vulgaris", "brief_summary": "This study is designed to study disease relapse after NBUVB and how the administration of Daclizumab/placebo alters disease relapse.", "detailed_description": "The first part of the study involves NB-UVB light treatment, a well-established treatment to treat psoriasis. In the second part, we are testing a drug known as Humanized CD25 Monoclonal Antibody (anti-TAC) or placebo to prevent disease relapse. Anti-TAC is an injectable medicine that is also designed to treat psoriasis by blocking a part of the immune system that we believe contributes to the disease.", "condition": "Psoriasis", "intervention_type": "Device", "intervention_name": "NB-UVB", "description": "total body NB-UVB at a dose that is 50% of the MED.
