{"brief_title": "Phase I Pilot Study of Ad5-CB-CFTR, an Adenovirus Vector Containing the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator Gene, in Patients With Cystic Fibrosis", "brief_summary": "OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the safety and efficacy of gene transfer into the nasal epithelium using Ad5-CB-CFTR, an E1-deleted adenovirus vector containing the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene, in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). II. Determine whether ion transport abnormalities in CF airway cells can be corrected.", "detailed_description": "PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Groups of 3 patients receive 1 of 4 doses of Ad5-CB-CFTR, a recombinant E1-deleted adenovirus serotype 5 vector containing the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene. Ad5-CB-CFTR is administered to 1 nasal cavity and the vehicle alone is administered to the opposite nasal cavity as the control.", "condition": ["Cystic Fibrosis"], "intervention_type": ["Genetic"], "intervention_name": ["Ad5-CB-CFTR"], "criteria": "PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA: --Disease Characteristics-- Cystic fibrosis No mild genetic mutations, i.e., normal nasal chloride ion permeability At least 2 weeks since decrease in pulmonary function --Prior/Concurrent Therapy-- At least 3 months since systemic cortisone At least 1 month since other therapeutic research study, e.g., DNAse --Patient Characteristics-- Other: Adequate endocrine, liver, kidney, and cardiac function Adenovirus antibody seropositive No pregnant or nursing women Negative pregnancy test required of fertile women Adequate contraception required of fertile patients", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "rare disease", "mesh_term": ["Fibrosis", "Cystic Fibrosis"], "id": "NCT00004779"}
