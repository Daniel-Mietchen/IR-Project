{"brief_title": "The MI-HEART Project", "brief_summary": "The purpose of the study is to examine ways in which a clinical information system can help patients better recognize the signs and symptoms of an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) and to take actions to decrease morbidity and mortality that may be related to delay in seeking treatment. The software-based intervention will use the best scientific evidence to create tailored strategies using a patient's specific health data. This approach is based on well-established cognitive and behavioral educational models.", "condition": "Coronary Disease", "intervention_type": "Behavioral", "intervention_name": "Tailored Education Messages", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria - Patients at high-risk for an acute myocardial infarction, including any 2 of these risk factors: males age > 45; females age >55; family history of premature coronary heart disease (CHD); current cigarette smoker; hypertension; or elevated total cholesterol with low HDL and/or high LDL.
