{"brief_title": "Combination Study With MVA BN and Dryvax", "brief_summary": "The overall goals of this study are to expand the available data on the safety and immunogenicity of MVA-BN in vaccinia-naive adults and to determine the optimum dose of MVA-BN to induce immune responses and attenuate Dryvax take reactions. Participants will include 90 healthy volunteers, ages 18-32 years. Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 6 study groups (groups A-F). Participants will be involved in study related procedures for up to 2 years. During this time, volunteers will return periodically for blood draws to check immune responses.", "detailed_description": "The primary goal of this phase I trial is to expand the available data on the safety and immunogenicity of MVA-BN in vaccinia-na\u00efve adults. The secondary goals of this vaccine trial are: to determine the optimum dose of MVA-BN, given twice, to induce an immune response and attenuate Dryvax\u00ae take reactions; and to compare the ability of 2 routes of administration of MVA-BN, subcutaneous and intramuscular, to induce an immune response at the highest tested dose. A total of 90 healthy adult volunteers ages 18-32 will participate in this study. The volunteers will be randomly assigned to 1 of 6 groups to be immunized with: MVA-BN (subcutaneously) at 1 of 3 dose levels and Dryvax\u00ae (per scarification); placebo (subcutaneously) and Dryvax\u00ae (per scarification); MVA-BN (subcutaneously) at the highest dose level and placebo scarification; or MVA-BN (intramuscularly) at the highest dose level and Dryvax\u00ae (per scarification). The study will last about 30 months. Each volunteer's participation will last 6 months for all treatment groups. Subjects randomized to treatment groups D and E will have follow-up for 2 years. During this time, volunteers will return periodically for blood draws to check immune responses. Subjects will require visits for dressing changes as needed post-Dryvax vaccination. Variables to be investigated include: adverse events and side effects to the vaccines, and immunogenicity testing including antibody and cellular responses to the vaccines.", "condition": ["Smallpox"], "intervention_type": ["Biological", "Biological", "Biological", "Other", "Other"], "intervention_name": ["Live vaccinia virus vaccine", "MVA Smallpox Vaccine", "MVA Smallpox Vaccine", "Placebo", "Placebo"], "description": ["Dryvax\u00ae: 0.25 mL of vaccine will be administered by the standard route of scarification using a bifurcated needle on day 112 for Groups A, B, C, D and F.", "Imvamune/MVA-BN 1x10^8 will be administered intramuscularly to Group F on day 0 and day 28.", "Imvamune/MVA-BN Groups A, B C and E will be administered subcutaneously: 2x10^7, 5x10^7, 1x10^8, 1x10^8, respectively, on days 0 and day 28.", "Group E will receive sterile saline placebo for injection via scarification on day 112.", "Group D will receive sterile saline placebo for injection subcutaneously on day 0 and day 28."], "arm_group_label": ["A", "B", "C", "D", "F", "F", "A", "B", "C", "E", "E", "D"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Ages 18-32. - Never received smallpox vaccination. - Read, signed and dated informed consent document. - Availability for follow-up for the planned duration of the study two years after first immunization. - Acceptable medical history by screening evaluation and limited physical examination. - For women, negative serum pregnancy test at screening and negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to vaccination. - If the volunteer is female and of child bearing potential, she agrees to use acceptable contraception, and not become pregnant for at least 56 days after the last vaccination.
