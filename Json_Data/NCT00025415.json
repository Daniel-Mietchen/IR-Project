{"brief_title": "Imatinib Mesylate in Treating Patients With Advanced Cancer and Liver Dysfunction", "brief_summary": "Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of imatinib mesylate in treating patients who have advanced cancer and liver dysfunction", "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of imatinib mesylate in patients with advanced malignancies and varying degrees of liver dysfunction. II. Determine the effects of hepatic dysfunction on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the non-dose-limiting toxic effects of this drug in these patients. IV. Determine the response rate of these patients treated with this drug. V. Correlate the Childs-Pugh classification of hepatic dysfunction with observed toxic effects, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to liver dysfunction (normal vs mild vs moderate vs severe). Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate daily. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients within each stratum (except normal stratum) receive escalating doses of imatinib mesylate until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.", "condition": ["Accelerated Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia", "Acute Undifferentiated Leukemia", "AIDS-related Peripheral/Systemic Lymphoma", "AIDS-related Primary CNS Lymphoma", "Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma", "Angioimmunoblastic T-cell Lymphoma", "Atypical Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, BCR-ABL1 Negative", "Blastic Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia", "Childhood Myelodysplastic Syndromes", "Chronic Eosinophilic Leukemia", "Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia, BCR-ABL1 Positive", "Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia", "Chronic Neutrophilic Leukemia", "Chronic Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia", "de Novo Myelodysplastic Syndromes", "Essential Thrombocythemia", "Extramedullary Plasmacytoma", "Extranodal Marginal Zone B-cell Lymphoma of Mucosa-associated Lymphoid Tissue", "Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor", "Intraocular Lymphoma", "Isolated Plasmacytoma of Bone", "Meningeal Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia", "Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance", "Myelodysplastic/Myeloproliferative Neoplasm, Unclassifiable", "Nodal Marginal Zone B-cell Lymphoma", "Polycythemia Vera", "Previously Treated Myelodysplastic Syndromes", "Primary Central Nervous System Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Primary Myelofibrosis", "Primary Systemic Amyloidosis", "Progressive Hairy Cell Leukemia, Initial Treatment", "Prolymphocytic Leukemia", "Recurrent Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia", "Recurrent Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia", "Recurrent Adult Burkitt Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Diffuse Mixed Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Diffuse Small Cleaved Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Immunoblastic Large Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Lymphoblastic Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma", "Recurrent Cutaneous T-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Recurrent Grade 1 Follicular Lymphoma", "Recurrent Grade 2 Follicular Lymphoma", "Recurrent Grade 3 Follicular Lymphoma", "Recurrent Mantle Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Marginal Zone Lymphoma", "Recurrent Mycosis Fungoides/Sezary Syndrome", "Recurrent Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma", "Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia", "Refractory Hairy Cell Leukemia", "Refractory Multiple Myeloma", "Relapsing Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia", "Secondary Acute Myeloid Leukemia", "Secondary Myelodysplastic Syndromes", "Small Intestine Lymphoma", "Splenic Marginal Zone Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Burkitt Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Diffuse Mixed Cell Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Diffuse Small Cleaved Cell Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Immunoblastic Large Cell Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Lymphoblastic Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma", "Stage IV Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia", "Stage IV Cutaneous T-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Stage IV Grade 1 Follicular Lymphoma", "Stage IV Grade 2 Follicular Lymphoma", "Stage IV Grade 3 Follicular Lymphoma", "Stage IV Mantle Cell Lymphoma", "Stage IV Marginal Zone Lymphoma", "Stage IV Mycosis Fungoides/Sezary Syndrome", "Stage IV Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma", "T-cell Large Granular Lymphocyte Leukemia", "Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific", "Untreated Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia", "Untreated Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia", "Untreated Hairy Cell Leukemia", "Waldenstr\u00f6m Macroglobulinemia"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Other"], "intervention_name": ["imatinib mesylate", "pharmacological study"], "description": ["Given orally", "Correlative studies"], "arm_group_label": ["Treatment (imatinib mesylate)", "Treatment (imatinib mesylate)"], "other_name": ["CGP 57148", "Gleevec", "Glivec", "pharmacological studies"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: -
