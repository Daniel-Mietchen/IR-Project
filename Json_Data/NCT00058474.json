{"brief_title": "Radiation Therapy and Either Capecitabine or Fluorouracil With or Without Oxaliplatin Before Surgery in Treating Patients With Resectable Rectal Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying radiation therapy and either capecitabine or fluorouracil with or without oxaliplatin and comparing them to see how well they work when given before surgery in treating patients with resectable rectal cancer. It is not yet known whether radiation therapy and either capecitabine or fluorouracil is more effective with or without oxaliplatin in treating rectal cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare the rate of local-regional relapse in patients with resectable rectal cancer treated with chemoradiotherapy comprising radiation therapy and either capecitabine or fluorouracil with or without oxaliplatin. Secondary - Compare the rate of clinical complete response in patients treated with these regimens. - Compare the rate of pathologic complete response in patients treated with these regimens. - Determine the increase in the number of patients who are able to undergo sphincter-saving surgery after treatment with these regimens. - Correlate genetic patterns and the presence or absence of specific tissue biomarkers with response and prognosis in patients treated with these regimens. - Compare preoperative quality of life (QOL) of patients treated with oral capecitabine versus continuous infusion with fluorouracil. - Determine the impact of oxaliplatin on neurotoxicity in patients treated with these regimens. - Compare the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients. - Compare the convenience of care in patients treated with these regimens. - Determine the impact of the type of surgical management on QOL at 1 and 5 years postoperatively in these patients. - Describe the long-term impact of cancer treatment on symptoms (e.g., vitality and neurotoxicity) and QOL at 5 years after randomization (5-year follow-up visit). OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to participating center, gender, clinical tumor stage (stage II vs stage III), and surgical intent (sphincter saving vs non-sphincter saving). Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms. - Arm 1: Patients receive fluorouracil IV continuously and undergo radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 5-6 weeks. - Arm 2: Patients receive fluorouracil and undergo radiotherapy as in arm 1. Patients also receive oxaliplatin IV over 1 hour once weekly for 5 weeks. - Arm 3: Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily and undergo radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 5-6 weeks. - Arm 4: Patients receive capecitabine and undergo radiotherapy as in arm 3. Patients also receive oxaliplatin as in arm 2. Within 6-8 weeks after the completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients with responding or stable disease undergo surgery. Patients with progressive disease are treated at the discretion of the investigator and continue to be followed. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at completion of chemoradiotherapy, and at 1 and 5 years after surgery. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,606 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.", "condition": ["Colorectal Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Drug", "Radiation"], "intervention_name": ["capecitabine", "fluorouracil", "oxaliplatin", "radiation therapy"], "description": ["825 mg/m2 oral daily 5 days a week on days of planned RT", "225 mg/m2 IV daily continuous infusion", "50 mg/m2 IV 5 days a week on days of planned RT", "Given 5 days a week for 5-6 weeks"], "arm_group_label": ["Arm 3: Capecitabine + RT", "Arm 4: Capecitabine + RT + Oxaliplatin", "Arm 1: 5-FU + RT", "Arm 2: 5-FU + RT + Oxaliplatin", "Arm 2: 5-FU + RT + Oxaliplatin", "Arm 4: Capecitabine + RT + Oxaliplatin", "Arm 1: 5-FU + RT", "Arm 2: 5-FU + RT + Oxaliplatin", "Arm 3: Capecitabine + RT", "Arm 4: Capecitabine + RT + Oxaliplatin"], "other_name": ["5-FU", "RT"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Patients must consent to participate in the study and must have signed and dated an IRB-approved consent form conforming to federal and institutional guidelines. - Patients must be > 18 years of age. - Patients must have a life expectancy of 5 years, excluding their diagnosis of cancer (as determined by the investigator), and must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) (Zubrod) performance status of 0 or 1. - Patients must have a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the rectum obtained by a biopsy technique which leaves the major portion of the tumor intact. - The interval between the initial diagnosis of rectal adenocarcinoma and randomization must be no more than 42 days. - Prior to randomization, the investigator must specify the intent for sphincter saving or non-sphincter saving surgery. - The tumor must be either palpable by digital rectal exam or be accessible via a proctoscope or sigmoidoscope. - Distal border of the tumor must be located < 12 cm from the anal verge. - The tumor must be considered by the surgeon to be amenable to curative resection. (Note that curative resection can include pelvic exenteration.) - The tumor must be clinically Stage II (T3-4 N0 with N0 being defined as all imaged lymph nodes are < 1.0 cm) or Stage III (T1-4 N1-2 with the definition of a clinically positive node being any node > 1.0 cm). Stage of the primary tumor may be determined by ultrasound or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Computed Tomography (CT) scan is acceptable provided there is evidence of T4 and/or N1-2 disease. - At the time of randomization, all patients must have had the following within the previous 42 days: history and physical examination; if technically feasible, a complete colonoscopic examination; if not feasible, a proctoscopic or sigmoidoscopic exam; clinical staging of the tumor; CT or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis (combined PET/CT may be substituted), and a chest x-ray (PA and lateral) or CT scan of the chest to exclude patients with metastatic disease. - At the time of randomization: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be > 1,200/mm3; Platelet count must be > 100,000/mm3; There must be evidence of adequate hepatic function as follows: total bilirubin must be < 1.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) for the lab; and alkaline phosphatase must be < 2.5 x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) for the lab; and the Aspartate Amino Transferase (AST) must be < 2.5 x ULN for the lab; and If AST is > ULN, serologic testing for Hepatitis B and C must be performed and results must be negative; Calculated creatinine clearance must be > 50 mL/min. - Patients with prior malignancies, including invasive colon cancer, are eligible if they have been disease-free for > 5 years and are deemed by their physician to be at low risk for recurrence.
