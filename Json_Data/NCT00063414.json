{"brief_title": "ISIS 2302-CS22, A 6-Week, Active-Controlled Clinical Study to Evaluate the Effectiveness of Alicaforsen (ISIS 2302) in Patients With Mild to Moderate Active Ulcerative Colitis", "brief_summary": "This is a multi-center trial to test the safety, efficacy and tolerability of alicaforsen (ISIS 2302), a new type of drug called an antisense drug, in patients with mild to moderate active Ulcerative Colitis (UC). Alicaforsen is designed to reduce the production of a specific protein, called ICAM-1, a substance that plays a significant role in the increase of inflammation and is likely to be involved in inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis. The ISIS 2302-CS22 study will examine the effects of one of two dosages of alicaforsen delivered by enema over a six-week period as compared to an active control, mesalamine enema (The probability of receiving the alicaforsen formulation is 2:1). The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the percentage reduction in DAI at Week 6.", "condition": "Ulcerative Colitis", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Alicaforsen", "criteria": "Inclusion criteria Patients must meet the following criteria at screening to be eligible for enrollment: - Age greater than or equal to 18 years - Diagnosis of ulcerative colitis of at least 6 months duration - Current left-sided flare, defined as activity in the colon 5-50 cm from the anal verge, extending at least 15 cm proximal to the anal verge and confirmed by endoscopic evaluation within 14 days of baseline visit. - Baseline DAI score of 4-10 including abnormal endoscopic score - On at least one or more of the following treatments for ulcerative colitis prior to baseline visit: 1.
