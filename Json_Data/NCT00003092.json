{"brief_title": "Paclitaxel in Treating Older Patients With Solid Tumors", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase III trial to study the effectiveness of paclitaxel in treating older patients who have solid tumors.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine whether there is a relationship between pharmacokinetic measurements of paclitaxel and aging. - Determine whether there is a relationship between the toxic effects of paclitaxel and aging. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to age (cohort 1: patients 55 to 64 vs cohort 2: patients 65 to 75 vs cohort 3: patients 75 and over).", "condition": "Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "paclitaxel", "arm_group_label": "Paclitaxel", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically proven nonhematologic malignancy PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 55 and over Performance status: - Zubrod 0-2 Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - Granulocyte count at least 1,500/mm3 - Platelet count at least 100,000/mm3 Hepatic: - Bilirubin less than 1.5 mg/dL - SGOT less than 2.0 times upper limit of normal (ULN) Renal: - Creatinine no greater than 1.5 times ULN Cardiovascular: - No uncontrolled or severe cardiovascular disease Other: - No serious intercurrent medical illnesses that in the judgement of the investigator compromise patient care - No psychiatric conditions that would preclude study - No requirement for antibiotics for active acute infection PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - Not specified Chemotherapy: - At least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin) - No more than one prior chemotherapy regimen allowed - No prior paclitaxel allowed Endocrine therapy: - Not specified Radiotherapy: - At least 4 weeks since prior radiation therapy Surgery: - Not specified", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "55 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00003092.xml"}
