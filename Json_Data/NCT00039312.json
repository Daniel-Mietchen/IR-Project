{"brief_title": "Comparison of Screening Tests in Detecting Cervical Neoplasia", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Screening tests may help doctors detect abnormal cells in the cervix early and plan effective treatment. PURPOSE: Screening trial to compare different types of screening tests used to detect cervical neoplasia.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Compare the sensitivity and specificity of primary screening strategies for the detection of cervical intraepithelial or invasive neoplasia. - Compare the positive and negative predictive values of these strategies. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to the reason for the visit (general gynecological screening vs colposcopy referral). - Stratum 1 (general gynecological screening): Patients undergo Pap smear, visual inspection aided by acetic acid (VIA), a colposcopy, and finally a visual inspection aided by toluidine blue (VIT) followed by an acetic acid wash. A biopsy may be performed at this initial visit. Within 2-3 weeks, patients are notified of results. - Stratum 2 (colposcopy referral): Patients undergo Pap smear, VIA, colposcopy, VIT, and possible biopsy as in stratum 1. During the same visit, patients receive histologic evaluation and treatment with See-and-Treat loop electrosurgical excision procedure and/or endocervical curettage. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 600-1,000 patients (300-500 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Cervical Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Other", "Other", "Procedure", "Procedure", "Procedure"], "intervention_name": ["Papanicolaou test", "cytology specimen collection procedure", "annual screening", "colposcopic biopsy", "comparison of screening methods"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:: - History of cervical neoplasia - Presenting for a well-woman visit, annual Pap smear, or family planning - Other gynecological or non-gynecological complaints allowed OR - Referred for colposcopy secondary to an abnormal Pap smear - Planned screening for cervical cancer - Over 18 years of age - Prior laser surgery, cryotherapy, or conization or loop electrosurgical excision procedure for cervical neoplasia allowed Exclusion Criteria: - bleeding diathesis - pregnant - prior hysterectomy - concurrent anticoagulants", "gender": "Female", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "cervical cancer", "mesh_term": ["Uterine Cervical Neoplasms"], "id": "NCT00039312"}
