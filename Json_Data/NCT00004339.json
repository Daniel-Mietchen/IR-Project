{"brief_title": "Study of Tetrathiomolybdate in Patients With Wilson Disease", "brief_summary": "OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the safety and efficacy of ammonium tetrathiomolybdate alone and compared with trientine therapy as initial treatment in patients with Wilson disease presenting neurologically.", "detailed_description": "PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This a double blind, randomized study. Patients are randomized into one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive tetrathiomolybdate (TM) 3 times a day with meals and 3 times a day between meals for 8 weeks in the absence of neurologic deterioration or unacceptable toxicity. Arm II: Patients receive trientine therapy for 8 weeks in the absence of neurologic deterioration and unacceptable toxicity. Additional therapy (off study): Patients in the TM group may receive maintenance zinc, while those in the trientine group may continue on trientine or switch to zinc.", "condition": ["Wilson Disease"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["tetrathiomolybdate", "trientine"], "criteria": "PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA: --Disease Characteristics-- - Wilson disease presenting with neurologic or psychiatric symptoms - No concurrent seizure activity - No white matter lesions on brain magnetic resonance imaging --Prior/Concurrent Therapy-- - No more than 2 weeks of prior therapy - No penicillamine or trientine for longer than 2 weeks --Patient Characteristics-- - Hepatic: No severe hepatic failure - Other: No psychiatric or medical contraindication to protocol therapy - Not pregnant", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "rare disease", "mesh_term": ["Hepatolenticular Degeneration", "Tetrathiomolybdate", "Trientine", "Molybdenum"], "id": "NCT00004339"}
