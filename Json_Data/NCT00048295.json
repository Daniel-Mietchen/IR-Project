{"brief_title": "Alicaforsen (ISIS 2302) in Patients With Active Crohn\u2019s Disease", "brief_summary": "ISIS 2302 is an antisense oligonucleotide drug that reduces the production of a specific protein called intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1), a substance that plays a significant role in the increase of inflammation. People with Crohn\u2019s disease have been shown to over-produce ICAM-1 in their gut tissues. Alicaforsen works by blocking ICAM-1 messenger RNA, the \u201cinstruction\u201d molecule that is required for the production of ICAM-1 protein. This trial will examine effects of alicaforsen delivered by 2-hour intravenous infusion over a four-week period, compared to a placebo. Patients may remain on stable background 5-ASA, antibiotic, or immunosuppressive drugs, and prednisone (or equivalent) at </= 30 mg per day.", "condition": ["Crohn's Disease"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Alicaforsen"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria 1.
