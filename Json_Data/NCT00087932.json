{"brief_title": "Socioeconomic Influences on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Use in Cancer Treatment", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to determine whether differences in the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) are influenced by the socioeconomic status and ethnicity of cancer patients.", "detailed_description": "The use of CAM is common among patients with cancer. However, there may be differences in participation, treatment preferences, and quality of life that are influenced by socioeconomic factors and ethnicity. This study will compare two distinct socioeconomic groups to determine differences in CAM use. Participants in this study will complete a questionnaire regarding demographics, socioeconomic status, disease specifics, and facilitators and barriers to CAM use. Participation in an introductory seminar and in various CAM programs will be monitored. Participants will also complete a quality of life scale that will provide insight into the way different populations perceive and use CAM and will identify potential obstacles to integrating CAM into other cancer treatment programs.", "condition": "Neoplasms", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Cancer diagnosis - Able to read and understand English", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00087932.xml"}
