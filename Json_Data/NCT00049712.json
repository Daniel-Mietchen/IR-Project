{"brief_title": "Monoclonal Antibody Therapy in Treating Patients With Refractory Advanced Solid Tumors or Lymphoma", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy in treating patients who have refractory advanced solid tumors or lymphoma.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of monoclonal antibody anti-alpha V beta 3 integrin (MEDI 522) in patients with refractory advanced solid tumors or lymphoma. - Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients. - Demonstrate significant binding of this drug to its molecular target in vivo in these patients. - Determine the effects of this drug on angiogenesis in these patients. - Determine antitumor activity of this drug by measuring tumor size and glucose uptake in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. - Determine a recommended phase II dose of this drug based on either the MTD or the optimal biologic response in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive monoclonal antibody anti-alpha V beta 3 integrin (Medi 522) IV over 30 minutes weekly. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of Medi 522 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 6-30 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Lymphoma", "Small Intestine Cancer", "Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific"], "intervention_type": ["Biological"], "intervention_name": ["etaracizumab"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumor or lymphoma that is refractory to currently available standard therapies or for which there are no curative therapies - No known brain metastases PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - 18 and over Performance status - ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy - More than 12 weeks Hematopoietic - WBC at least 3,000/mm^3 - Absolute neutrophil count at least 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 100,000/mm^3 - No prior bleeding disorder Hepatic - Bilirubin normal - AST/ALT no greater than 2.5 times upper limit of normal - INR/PTT normal Renal - Creatinine normal OR - Creatinine clearance at least 60 mL/min Cardiovascular - No symptomatic congestive heart failure - No unstable angina pectoris - No cardiac arrhythmia Other - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception during and for 6 months after study participation - HIV negative - T4 or thyroid stimulating hormone normal - No thyroid disease - No prior allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to study drug (e.g., rituximab or immunoglobulin G) - No ongoing or active infection - No other uncontrolled concurrent illness that would preclude study participation - No psychiatric illness or social situation that would preclude study participation PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - Not specified Chemotherapy - More than 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin) and recovered Endocrine therapy - Not specified Radiotherapy - More than 4 weeks since prior radiotherapy and recovered Surgery - More than 4 weeks since prior surgery Other - No other concurrent investigational agents - No other concurrent anticancer agents or therapies (commercial or investigational)", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "splenic marginal zone lymphoma", "mesh_term": ["Lymphoma", "Intestinal Neoplasms"], "id": "NCT00049712"}
