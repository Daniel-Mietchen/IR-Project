{"brief_title": "ORWH:SCOR on Sex and Gender Factors Affecting Women's Incontinence", "brief_summary": "This study consists of two studies with overlapping cohorts. One is a follow up epidemiological study of urinary incontinence, the other is a case control study of lower urinary tract dysfunction in women with diabetes. Study One: Subjects for the study will be a retrospective cohort of 2100 middle-aged and older women from a large health maintenance organization who have participated in the Reproductive Risk Factor for Incontinence Study at Kaiser (RRISK). The RRISK I study assembled a retrospective cohort of long-term female Kaiser Permanente members to determine the association between specific childbirth events, hysterectomy, hormone use and urinary incontinence later in life. The study also provides descriptive information on urinary incontinence by type, age, ethnicity, severity and age of onset. Study Two: Women with diabetes have a 30-70% increased risk of lower urinary tract dysfunction, including lower urinary tract symptoms, urinary incontinence, and ultimately bladder cystopathy. This sudy investigates the natural history, risk factors, and possible mechanisms of lower urinary tract dysfunction and infection among women with type 2 diabetes as compared to women without diabetes.", "condition": "Diabetes", "study_pop": "\n      ", "sampling_method": "Non-Probability Sample", "criteria": "Previous participation in the Reproductive Risk Factors for Incontinence Study at Kaiser.", "gender": "Female", "minimum_age": "44 Years", "maximum_age": "73 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "Accepts Healthy Volunteers", "id": "NCT00069368.xml"}
