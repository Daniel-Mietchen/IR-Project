{"brief_title": "MS-275 in Treating Patients With Hematologic Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of MS-275 in treating patients who have hematologic cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the toxic effects and pharmacokinetics of MS-275 in patients with poor-risk hematologic malignancy. - Determine whether this drug induces changes in hematologic differentiation, in terms of changes in morphology, cell surface marker expression, and acetylation status, in these patients. - Determine whether this drug induces clinical response in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive oral MS-275 on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of MS-275 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 25-30 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Leukemia", "Multiple Myeloma and Plasma Cell Neoplasm", "Myelodysplastic Syndromes", "Myelodysplastic/Myeloproliferative Diseases"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["entinostat"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - One of the following histologically confirmed diagnoses: - Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) - Newly diagnosed de novo AML in patients over 60 years old with the following poor-risk features: - Antecedent hematologic disorder - Complex karyotype or other adverse cytogenetics - Stem cell immunophenotype - AML arising from myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) - Secondary AML - Relapsed or refractory AML, including primary induction failure - MDS - Poor-risk, defined as the following: - International Performance Score at least 1.5 - More than 10% marrow blasts - Cytopenias in at least 2 lineages - Refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) - RAEB in transformation - Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia - Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) - Newly diagnosed de novo ALL in patients over 60 years old with the following poor-risk features: - Complex karyotype or other adverse cytogenetics - Mixed lineage immunophenotype - Relapsed or refractory ALL, including primary induction failure - Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) - CML in accelerated phase or blast crisis - Interferon-refractory CML in chronic phase - Multiple myeloma (MM) - Relapsed or refractory, including prior autologous stem cell transplantation - Acute promyelocytic leukemia - Prior treatment with tretinoin - Ineligible for arsenic trioxide - No evidence of active coagulopathy - Low-risk for developing clinically significant coagulopathy during study - Low tumor burden by marrow aspiration at time of relapse - No prior coagulation-related sequelae (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or CNS thrombosis or bleed) - Failure after primary induction therapy or relapse after complete remission allowed if patient received no more than 3 courses of prior induction/reinduction therapy - Not eligible for curative stem cell transplantation - No hyperleukocytosis with at least 50,000/mm^3 leukemic blasts - No active CNS leukemia - No plasma cell leukemia - No amyloidosis resulting in major organ dysfunction PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 and over Performance status: - ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - See Disease Characteristics - No disseminated intravascular coagulation - No hyperviscosity Hepatic: - AST/ALT no greater than 2 times normal - Alkaline phosphatase no greater than 2 times normal - Bilirubin no greater than 1.5 times normal Renal: - Creatinine no greater than 1.5 times normal - No uncorrected hypercalcemia Cardiovascular: - See Disease Characteristics - LVEF at least 45% by MUGA or echocardiogram - No intrinsic impaired cardiac function, including any of the following: - Myocardial infarction within the past 3 months - Prior severe coronary artery disease - Cardiomyopathy - Congestive heart failure Other: - No active uncontrolled infection - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - See Disease Characteristics - At least 1 week since prior growth factors (epoetin alfa, filgrastim [G-CSF], sargramostim [GM-CSF], interleukin [IL]-3, or IL-11) - At least 4 weeks since prior autologous stem cell transplantation - No prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation - No concurrent immunotherapy Chemotherapy: - See Disease Characteristics - At least 3 weeks since prior chemotherapy and recovered - At least 24 hours since prior hydroxyurea or mercaptopurine for prevention of leukostasis - No concurrent chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: - Not specified Radiotherapy: - At least 2 weeks since prior emergency radiotherapy to large soft tissue or lytic bony lesions for MM - No concurrent radiotherapy Surgery: - Not specified Other: - At least 24 hours since other prior noncytotoxic agents for prevention of leukostasis - No other concurrent antitumor therapy", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "adult acute myeloid leukemia with t(15;17)(q22;q12)", "mesh_term": ["Syndrome", "Leukemia", "Multiple Myeloma", "Neoplasms, Plasma Cell", "Myelodysplastic Syndromes", "Preleukemia", "Myeloproliferative Disorders", "Plasmacytoma", "Myelodysplastic-Myeloproliferative Diseases", "Entinostat"], "id": "NCT00015925"}
