{"brief_title": "Vaccine Therapy Plus Interleukin-12 in Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer That Has Not Responded to Hormone Therapy", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a patient's white blood cells may make the body build an immune response to kill cancer cells. Interleukin-12 may kill cancer cells by stopping blood flow to the tumor and by stimulating a person's white blood cells to kill cancer cells. Combining vaccine therapy with interleukin-12 may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy combined with interleukin-12 in treating patients who have metastatic prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine whether immunization with prostate-specific membrane antigen-pulsed autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells and interleukin-12 can promote specific T-cell priming in patients with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer. - Determine the clinical response in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: Patients receive prostate-specific membrane antigen-pulsed autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells subcutaneously (SC) on day 1 and interleukin-12 SC on days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3-9 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 37 weeks.", "condition": ["Prostate Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Biological", "Biological"], "intervention_name": ["PSA prostate cancer vaccine", "recombinant interleukin-12"], "arm_group_label": ["PSMA peptide vaccine", "PSMA peptide vaccine"], "other_name": ["IL-12, rhIL-12"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate - HLA-A2 positive - Progressive measurable systemic disease - PSA at least 5 ng/mL with 2 consecutive rising PSA levels at least 1 week apart and no measurable disease OR - Objective evidence of disease progression by a 20% increase in the sum of longest diameter of all target lesions or evidence of new lesions by CT or bone scan regardless of PSA status - Lesions must be at least 1 cm to be considered measurable - Progressive systemic disease after discontinuation of anti-androgen therapy - Previously treated with orchiectomy (testosterone less than 50 ng/mL) OR luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue therapy with or without anti-androgens - If on LHRH analogue therapy, must continue therapy during study - Brain metastases allowed if previously treated, clinically stable, and weaned from prior corticosteroids PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - Over 18 Performance status: - Karnofsky 70-100% Life expectancy: - At least 12 weeks Hematopoietic: - Absolute neutrophil count greater than 1,500/mm^3 - Hemoglobin greater than 9 g/dL - Platelet count greater than 100,000/mm^3 - No active gastrointestinal bleeding Hepatic: - Bilirubin less than 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) - SGPT normal - Hepatitis B surface antigen negative Renal: - Creatinine less than 1.5 times ULN - Calcium less than 11 mg/dL Cardiovascular: - No significant cardiovascular disease - No cardiac arrhythmia requiring therapy Other: - Fertile patients must use effective barrier contraception - No intrinsic immunosuppression - HIV negative - No serious concurrent infection - No psychiatric illness that would preclude study compliance - No clinically significant autoimmune disease - No uncontrolled peptic ulcer disease - No history of inflammatory bowel disease PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - At least 4 weeks since prior biologic therapy Chemotherapy: - Not specified Endocrine therapy: - See Disease Characteristics - At least 4 weeks since prior flutamide - At least 6 weeks since prior bicalutamide or nilutamide - No concurrent systemic corticosteroids except physiologic replacement doses Radiotherapy: - Not specified Surgery: - See Disease Characteristics Other: - No concurrent immunosuppressive drugs (e.g., cyclosporine)", "gender": "Male", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "recurrent prostate cancer", "mesh_term": ["Prostatic Neoplasms", "Vaccines", "Interleukin-12"], "id": "NCT00015977"}
