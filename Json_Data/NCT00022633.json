{"brief_title": "S0028, Gemcitabine and Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Advanced or Recurrent Cancer of the Urinary Tract", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining gemcitabine and paclitaxel in treating patients who have advanced or recurrent cancer of the urinary tract.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the feasibility of enrolling patients aged 70 years and older with advanced or recurrent urothelial cancer to a structured phase II study. - Determine the anticancer efficacy of gemcitabine and paclitaxel, in terms of objective response rate and 2-year survival, in these elderly patients. - Assess the toxicity and tolerability of this regimen in these elderly patients. - Determine the feasibility of using standardized self-report measures of comorbidity, depression, and functional status in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these elderly patients and validate this data against similar parameters in patients aged under 60 years. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age (70 and over vs under 60). Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1 and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients (60 age 70 and over and 20 under age 60) will be accrued for this study.", "condition": "Urethral Cancer", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "paclitaxel", "arm_group_label": "gemcitabine, paclitaxel", "other_name": "Taxol", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed urothelial cancer - Transitional cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or squamous carcinoma (bladder, renal pelvis, ureter, or urethra) - Previously untreated metastatic or locoregionally advanced (i.e., bulky pelvic nodes) disease OR - Locally recurrent carcinoma after radiotherapy or cystectomy and no longer eligible for further radiotherapy or surgery - Measurable disease PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 70 and over OR - Under 60 Performance status: - Zubrod 0-2 Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - Absolute granulocyte count at least 1,200/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 100,000/mm^3 Hepatic: - Bilirubin no greater than upper limit of normal (ULN) - Aspartate aminotransferase (SGOT) or alanine aminotransferase (SGPT) no greater than 2 times ULN Renal: - Creatinine no greater than ULN Other: - HIV negative - No other concurrent life-threatening medical disorder that would preclude study participation - No other prior malignancy within the past 5 years except adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or adequately treated stage I or II cancer in complete remission - Not pregnant or nursing - Fertile patients must use effective contraception PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - Not specified Chemotherapy: - Prior adjuvant chemotherapy is allowed provided administered more than 10 years ago - No prior gemcitabine, taxanes, or platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: - Not specified Radiotherapy: - See Disease Characteristics - At least 28 days since prior radiotherapy and recovered Surgery: - See Disease Characteristics - At least 28 days since prior surgery and recovered", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "120 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00022633.xml"}
