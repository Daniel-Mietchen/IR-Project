{"brief_title": "Carboxypeptidase-G2 in Treating Nervous System Toxic Effects in Patients Given an Overdose of Intrathecal Methotrexate", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Chemoprotective drugs such as carboxypeptidase-G2 may protect normal cells from the toxic effects of chemotherapy. PURPOSE: Clinical trial to study the effectiveness of carboxypeptidase-G2 in treating nervous system toxic effects in patients given an accidental overdose of intrathecal methotrexate.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the effectiveness of carboxypeptidase-G2 rescue in patients who develop life threatening methotrexate (MTX) neurotoxicity following accidental intrathecal MTX overdose. - Study the CSF pharmacokinetics of MTX following rescue. OUTLINE: Patients undergo a lumbar puncture as soon as possible after methotrexate overdose to remove methotrexate and receive a single dose of carboxypeptidase-G2 intrathecally over 5 minutes. Patients are followed for at least 1 month. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 10 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Neurotoxicity", "Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific", "Unspecified Childhood Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["glucarpidase"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Patients who received an intrathecal overdose of methotrexate of 100 mg or more PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - Any age Performance status: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - Not specified Hepatic: - Not specified Renal: - Not specified Other: - No prior anaphylactic reaction to carboxypeptidase-G2 administration PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - Not specified Chemotherapy - See Disease Characteristics Endocrine therapy - Not specified Radiotherapy - Not specified Surgery - Not specified Other - Concurrent therapy allowed", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "neurotoxicity", "mesh_term": ["Neoplasms", "Neurotoxicity Syndromes", "Methotrexate"], "id": "NCT00018967"}
