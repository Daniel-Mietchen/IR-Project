{"brief_title": "Antineoplaston Therapy in Treating Patients With Brain Stem Glioma", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Current therapies for a brain stem glioma provide very limited benefit to the patient. The anti-cancer properties of Antineoplaston therapy suggest that it may prove beneficial in the treatment of brain stem gliomas. PURPOSE: This study is being performed to determine the effects (good and bad) that Antineoplaston therapy has on children (> 6 months of age) and adults with newly-diagnosed or recurrent brain stem gliomas.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - To determine the efficacy of Antineoplaston therapy in patients with a brain stem glioma, as measured by an objective response to therapy (complete response, partial response or stable disease). - To determine the safety and tolerance of Antineoplaston therapy in patients with a brain stem glioma. OVERVIEW: This is a single arm, open-label study in which patients receive gradually escalating doses of intravenous Antineoplaston therapy (Atengenal + Astugenal) until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Treatment continues for at least 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 12 months, patients with a complete or partial response or with stable disease may continue treatment. To determine objective response, tumor size in measured utilizing MRI scans, which are performed every 8 weeks for the first 2 years, every 3 months for the 3rd and 4th years, every 6 months for the 5th and 6th years, and annually thereafter.
