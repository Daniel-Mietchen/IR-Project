{"brief_title": "Daily-Dose Consensus Interferon and Ribavirin: Efficacy of Combined Therapy", "brief_summary": "This Phase 3 clinical study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of two dose levels of Infergen (interferon alfacon-1, CIFN) plus Ribavirin administered daily for 48 weeks and no treatment in patients chronically infected with hepatitis C who are nonresponders to previous pegylated interferon alfa plus ribavirin therapy. Patients are randomized 1:1:1 to receive Interferon Alfacon-1 (9 or 15 \u00b5g) + Ribavirin (both administered daily) or no treatment for up to 48 weeks. The protocol and informed consent form that will be used must be approved by the Investigator\u2019s Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) before the study is initiated.", "condition": ["Chronic Hepatitis C"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Daily Infergen (Interferon Alfacon-1, CIFN) (9 or 15 \u00b5g) + Ribavirin (1000-1200 mg, based on body weight) PO Daily for up to 48 wks"], "criteria": "(Abbreviated due to space constraints.)
