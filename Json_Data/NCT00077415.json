{"brief_title": "3-AP and Gemcitabine as Second-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as 3-AP and gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving 3-AP together with gemcitabine as second-line therapy works in treating patients with recurrent stage III or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the objective response rate in patients with stage III or IV recurrent non-small cell lung cancer treated with 3-AP (Triapine\u00ae) and gemcitabine as second-line therapy. Secondary - Determine the response duration, median time to progression, and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the effect of 3-AP (Triapine\u00ae) on gemcitabine pharmacokinetics and cellular uptake into peripheral mononuclear cells in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to participating center. Patients receive 3-AP (Triapine\u00ae) IV over 4 hours and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15*. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. NOTE: *For course 1 only, gemcitabine is administered alone on day 1 and in combination with 3-AP (Triapine\u00ae) on days 8 and 15. Patients are followed every 3 months for up to 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-31 patients will be accrued for this study within 7.5-21 months.", "condition": ["Lung Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["gemcitabine hydrochloride", "triapine"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically or cytologically confirmed* non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) - Stage III or IV disease - One of the following cellular types: - Adenocarcinoma - Non-diffuse bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma - Large cell carcinoma - Squamous cell carcinoma NOTE: *A repeat biopsy of any accessible tumor site is required if > 5 years have elapsed since the initial diagnosis - Progressive disease after 1 prior gemcitabine-containing chemotherapy regimen for stage III or IV NSCLC and must have achieved, at least once, a partial response, complete response, or stable disease during therapy - Not a primary non-responder and experienced only progressive disease during gemcitabine-containing chemotherapy - Measurable disease - At least 1 unidimensionally measurable lesion \u2265 20 mm by conventional techniques OR \u2265 10 mm by spiral CT scan - No known brain metastases PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - 18 and over Performance status - ECOG 0-2 OR - Karnofsky 60-100% Life expectancy - Not specified Hematopoietic - WBC \u2265 3,000/mm^3 - Absolute neutrophil count \u2265 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count \u2265 100,000/mm^3 - No glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency Hepatic - Bilirubin \u2264 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) - ALT \u2264 2.5 times ULN (5 times ULN if liver metastases are present) Renal - Creatinine \u2264 1.5 times ULN OR - Creatinine clearance \u2265 50 mL/min Cardiovascular - No prior uncontrolled cardiac disease - No myocardial infarction within the past 12 months - No symptomatic congestive heart failure - No coronary artery disease - No cardiac arrhythmia Pulmonary - No uncontrolled symptomatic pulmonary disease - No pulmonary disease that requires oxygen therapy Other - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception - No other malignancy within the past 5 years except completely treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix or nonmelanoma skin cancer - No prior allergic reaction attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biological composition to study agents - No other concurrent uncontrolled illness - No psychiatric illness or social situation that would preclude study compliance PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - Not specified Chemotherapy - See Disease Characteristics - More than 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin) and recovered Endocrine therapy - Not specified Radiotherapy - More than 4 weeks since prior radiotherapy and recovered Surgery - Not specified Other - No concurrent combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-positive patients - No other concurrent investigational agents - No other concurrent anticancer agents or therapies", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "squamous cell lung cancer", "mesh_term": ["Lung Neoplasms", "Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung", "Gemcitabine"], "id": "NCT00077415"}
