{"brief_title": "Comparison of Four Combination Chemotherapy Regimens Using Cisplatin in Treating Patients With Stage IVB, Recurrent, or Persistent Cancer of the Cervix", "brief_summary": "This randomized phase III trial is studying four combination chemotherapy regimens using cisplatin to compare how well they work in treating women with stage IVB, recurrent, or persistent cancer of the cervix. Drugs used in chemotherapy such as cisplatin, paclitaxel, vinorelbine, gemcitabine, and topotecan, use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. It is not yet known which combination chemotherapy regimen containing cisplatin is most effective in treating cervical cancer.", "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the survival and response of patients with stage IVB, recurrent, or persistent carcinoma of the cervix when treated with paclitaxel and cisplatin vs vinorelbine and cisplatin vs gemcitabine and cisplatin vs topotecan and cisplatin. II. Compare the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients. III. Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 24 hours on day 1 and cisplatin IV over 1-4 hours on day 2. ARM II: Patients receive vinorelbine IV over 6-10 minutes on days 1 and 8 and cisplatin IV over 1-4 hours on day 1. ARM III: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 8 and cisplatin as in arm II. ARM IV: Patients receive topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1-3 and cisplatin as in arm II. In all arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, before courses 2 and 5, and at 9 months after study entry. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.", "condition": ["Cervical Adenocarcinoma", "Cervical Adenosquamous Carcinoma", "Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma", "Recurrent Cervical Carcinoma", "Stage IVB Cervical Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Drug", "Other", "Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Cisplatin", "Gemcitabine Hydrochloride", "Paclitaxel", "Quality-of-Life Assessment", "Topotecan Hydrochloride", "Vinorelbine Tartrate"], "description": ["Given IV", "Given IV", "Ancillary studies", "Given IV", "Given IV"], "arm_group_label": ["Arm I (paclitaxel, cisplatin)", "Arm II (vinorelbine, cisplatin)", "Arm III (gemcitabine, cisplatin)", "Arm IV (topotecan, cisplatin)", "Arm III (gemcitabine, cisplatin)", "Arm I (paclitaxel, cisplatin)", "Arm I (paclitaxel, cisplatin)", "Arm II (vinorelbine, cisplatin)", "Arm III (gemcitabine, cisplatin)", "Arm IV (topotecan, cisplatin)", "Arm IV (topotecan, cisplatin)", "Arm II (vinorelbine, cisplatin)"], "other_name": ["Abiplatin", "Blastolem", "Briplatin", "CDDP", "Cis-diammine-dichloroplatinum", "Cis-diamminedichloridoplatinum", "Cis-diamminedichloro Platinum (II)", "Cis-diamminedichloroplatinum", "Cis-dichloroammine Platinum (II)", "Cis-platinous Diamine Dichloride", "Cis-platinum", "Cis-platinum II", "Cis-platinum II Diamine Dichloride", "Cismaplat", "Cisplatina", "Cisplatinum", "Cisplatyl", "Citoplatino", "Citosin", "Cysplatyna", "DDP", "Lederplatin", "Metaplatin", "Neoplatin", "Peyrone's Chloride", "Peyrone's Salt", "Placis", "Plastistil", "Platamine", "Platiblastin", "Platiblastin-S", "Platinex", "Platinol", "Platinol- AQ", "Platinol-AQ", "Platinol-AQ VHA Plus", "Platinoxan", "Platinum", "Platinum Diamminodichloride", "Platiran", "Platistin", "Platosin", "dFdCyd", "Difluorodeoxycytidine Hydrochloride", "Gemzar", "LY-188011", "Anzatax", "Asotax", "Bristaxol", "Praxel", "Taxol", "Taxol Konzentrat", "Quality of Life Assessment", "Hycamptamine", "Hycamtin", "SKF S-104864-A", "Topotecan HCl", "topotecan hydrochloride (oral)", "Biovelbin", "Eunades", "KW-2307", "Navelbine", "Navelbine Ditartrate", "NVB", "Vinorelbine Ditartrate"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Histologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, or adenocarcinoma of the cervix - Stage IVB, recurrent, or persistent disease - Not amenable to curative surgery and/or radiotherapy - At least 1 unidimensionally measurable lesion - At least 20 mm by palpation, plain x-ray, CT scan, or MRI OR at least 10 mm by spiral CT scan - Biopsy confirmation required if lesion is less than 30 mm - Target lesion must be outside of a previously irradiated field - No craniospinal metastases - Performance status - GOG 0-1 - Absolute neutrophil count at least 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 100,000/mm^3 - Bilirubin no greater than 1.5 times normal - Alkaline phosphatase no greater than 3 times normal - AST no greater than 3 times normal - Creatinine \u2264 1.2 mg/dL - Creatinine > 1.2 mg/dL but < 1.5 mg/dL AND creatinine clearance \u2265 50 mL/min - No bilateral hydronephrosis not alleviated by ureteral stents or percutaneous drainage - Not pregnant or nursing - Fertile patients must use effective contraception - No prior or concurrent malignancy within the past 5 years except nonmelanoma skin cancer - No prior malignancy whose treatment contraindicates the current study therapy - No concurrent clinically significant infection - No concurrent cytokines - At least 6 weeks since prior chemoradiotherapy and recovered - No prior chemotherapy (except when concurrently administered with radiotherapy) - At least 3 weeks since prior radiotherapy and recovered - Recovered from prior surgery", "gender": "Female", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "mesh_term": ["Carcinoma", "Carcinoma, Squamous Cell", "Adenocarcinoma", "Uterine Cervical Neoplasms", "Carcinoma, Adenosquamous", "Paclitaxel", "Vinorelbine", "Vinblastine", "Gemcitabine", "Albumin-Bound Paclitaxel", "Cisplatin", "Topotecan", "Succinylcholine"], "id": "NCT00064077"}
