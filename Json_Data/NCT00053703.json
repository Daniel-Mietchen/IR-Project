{"brief_title": "Treatment of Early Onset Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders (TEOSS)", "brief_summary": "This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of risperidone (Risperdal\u00ae), olanzapine (Zyprexa\u00ae), and molindone (Moban\u00ae) for the treatment of children and adolescents with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.", "detailed_description": "Little research has been conducted on the use of psychotropic agents in children and adolescents with early onset schizophrenia spectrum disorders. This study will compare antipsychotic agents with different mechanisms of action in children and adolescents who have schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder with active psychotic symptoms. Participants are randomly assigned to receive risperidone (Risperdal), olanzapine (Zyprexa), or molindone (Moban) for 8 weeks. After 11/2005, no additional patients will be assigned to olanzapine treatment. Patients with significant improvement and without side effects continue maintenance therapy for another 44 weeks. Participants who show significant negative symptoms after 8 weeks may be started on a mood stabilizer or antidepressant. Weight gain, metabolic changes, neurocognition, functional outcome, psychotic symptoms, extrapyramidal side effects, and the ability to sustain effective therapy over time are assessed.", "condition": ["Schizophrenia"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Risperidone", "Olanzapine (enrollment closed in this treatment)", "Molindone"], "description": ["oral risperidone 0.5mg to 6mg daily for up to 52 weeks", "oral olanzapine 5-20mg per day for up to 52 weeks", "oral molindone from 10-140mg/daily for up to 52 weeks"], "arm_group_label": ["risperidone", "olanzapine", "molindone"], "other_name": ["Risperdal", "Zyprexa", "Moban"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, or schizoaffective disorder with psychotic symptoms - Free of depot antipsychotic medication for at least 6 months.
