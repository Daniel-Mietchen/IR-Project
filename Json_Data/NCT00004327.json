{"brief_title": "Phase II Pilot Study of Octreotide, a Somatostatin Octapeptide Analog, for Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage in Hormone-Refractory Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia and Senile Ectasia", "brief_summary": "OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy of octreotide, a somatostatin octapeptide analog, in decreasing gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with hormone-refractory hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia or senile ectasia.", "detailed_description": "PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients are treated with subcutaneous injections of octreotide twice a day. The dose is adjusted based on response. If there is no requirement for transfusions or intravenous iron for 4 weeks and the hemoglobin is greater than 10 mg/dL, therapy is continued for 1 year. If there is no decrease in bleeding after 10 weeks, the patient is removed from study.", "condition": "Ectasia", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "octreotide", "criteria": "PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA: --Disease Characteristics-- Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia or senile ectasia Refractory to or unable to tolerate hormonal therapy, i.e.: Estrogen Progesterone Danazol Gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage requiring transfusion within past 3 months Recurrent GI bleeding over more than 1 year At least 4 units packed RBCs transfused within past year OR intravenous iron required more than 4 times within past year No other likely source of hemorrhage determined within past year --Prior/Concurrent Therapy-- Disease hormone-refractory --Patient Characteristics-- No octreotide sensitivity", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00004327.xml"}
