{"brief_title": "Phase II/III Study of Anti-VEGF in Neovascular AMD", "brief_summary": "The purpose of the study is to determine whether the anti-VEGF drug is effective at stabilizing and/or improving vision in patients with the wet form of AMD", "detailed_description": "This will be a randomized, double-masked, controlled, dose-ranging, multi-center comparative trial, in parallel groups. Patients will be stratified by clinical center, by percentage of classic CNV vessels: [predominantly classic (>50%) vs. minimally classic (1-49%) vs. purely occult (0%)], and according to whether, or not, they have received prior PDT with Visudyne (no more than once). All patients will be re-randomized after 54 weeks of treatment to either, continue or discontinue therapy for further 48 weeks.", "condition": ["Macular Degeneration", "Choroidal Neovascularization"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["EYE001 anti-VEGF aptamer"], "criteria": "Patients of either gender, aged 50 years or above, diagnosed with subfoveal CNV secondary to AMD and with best corrected visual acuity of 20/40 to 20/320 in the absence of subfoveal atrophy or scarring in the study eye, and better or equal to 20/800 in the fellow eye, may be enrolled.
