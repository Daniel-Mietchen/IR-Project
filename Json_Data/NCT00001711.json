{"brief_title": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Ofl Volunteers", "brief_summary": "Magnetic resonance is an imaging technique that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create images of the body. The technology used in magnetic resonance imaging continues to improve. Advancements in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) requires researchers to study new techniques in normal volunteers in order to understand how to use them in patients with diseases. In this study researchers plan to do a variety of diagnostic tests including magnetic resonance imaging on normal volunteers. The studies may involve injections of contrast media, substances injected into the blood of participant that improves the image created by the MRI scanner. The study is not expected to benefit the participants. However, information gathered from the study may be used to improve diagnostic techniques and develop new research studies.", "detailed_description": "Technical evaluation of magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy will be performed on subjects who are eligible and willing to volunteer to have a research MRI performed. These studies may involve the intravenous administration of commercially available MR contrast media, glucagon or secretin. Some scans may require gastrointestinal contrast such as water or dilute gadolinium or barium. We also use inhaled carbogen as a contrast media. The results will be used to evaluate the performance of various pulse sequences, gradient coils, and rf coils on human subjects and will provide essential ground work for specific patient protocols.", "condition": ["Healthy"], "criteria": "- INCLUSION CRITERIA: Any subject above the age of 18 who is capable of giving informed consent. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: A subject will be excluded if he/she has a contraindication to MR scanning implanted metal clips or wires of the type which may concentrate radiofrequency fields or cause tissue damage from twisting in a magnetic field. Examples include: aneurysm clip, implanted neural stimulator, implanted cardiac pacemaker or autodefibrillator, cochlear implant, ocular foreign body (e.g., metal shavings), any implanted device (pumps, infusion devices, etc), shrapnel injuries. For studies involving the injection of Gadolinium based contrast a serum Creatinine obtained within one week of the MRI examination. All subjects with a calculated eGFR less than 60 will be excluded from having a contrast enhanced MRI, but will not be excluded from the protocol for non contrasted MRI studies. To assess whether subjects are normal eligible to participate, they will be asked to fill out a questionnaire. Subjects will be excluded if it is deemed that they have a condition which would preclude their use for technical development (e.g. paralyzed hemidiaphragm, morbid obesity, claustrophobia etc.) or present unnecessary risks (e.g. pregnancy, surgery of uncertain type, symptoms of pheochromocystoma or insulinoma, etc.). Lactating women and subjects with hemoglobinopathies, asthma, or renal or hepatic disease will be excluded from studies involving the administration of contrast agents.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "Normal Volunteer", "id": "NCT00001711"}
