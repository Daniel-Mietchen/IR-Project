{"brief_title": "Clinical Investigation of Infections Due to Leishmanial Parasites", "brief_summary": "Mechanisms of host immune response to intracellular protozoa will be investigated in patients with naturally acquired infection employing a variety of in-vitro techniques. Both non-specific and antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses will be assessed. Parasites will be isolated from patients, cultivated in-vitro, and characterized. Responses to chemotherapy will be assessed parasitologically, immunologically and clinically.", "detailed_description": "The main purpose of this protocol is to permit us to see patients who are referred to us for diagnosis and treatment of known or suspected leishmaniasis (from the Peace Corps, Smithsonian Institution, tourists, etc.). In the process of working up these patients, we sometimes encounter parasite isolates that are useful for research. We also can perform tests of cell-mediated immune function to evaluate how patients are responding to therapy. In addition, the protocol permits us to observe therapeutic responses to other drugs besides pentavalent antimony, if necessary.", "condition": ["Leishmaniasis", "Leishmaniasis, Visceral"], "criteria": "Must be between the ages of 1 and 65 years.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "Accepts Healthy Volunteers", "keyword": "Leishmaniasis", "mesh_term": ["Leishmaniasis", "Leishmaniasis, Visceral"], "id": "NCT00001169"}
