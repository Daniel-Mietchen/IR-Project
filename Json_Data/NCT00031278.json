{"brief_title": "Safety And Efficacy Study Of The Combination Of CpG 7909 And Herceptin In Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to determine if the combination of CPG 7909 and Herceptin is safe and effective in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. RATIONALE: There is preclinical data that supports the hypothesis that CPG 7909 may potentiate the action of Herceptin. This Phase I/II study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination treatment of CPG 7909 and Herceptin in patients with metastatic breast cancer who have previously been treated with Herceptin and chemotherapy. SCHEDULE: Patients will receive CPG 7909 weekly for up to six months.", "detailed_description": "Phase II part of study not initiated because the development plan modified the route of administration to subcutaneous injection.", "condition": "Carcinoma, Metastatic Breast", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Herceptin\u00ae", "description": "Herceptin\u00ae will be administered at a dose of 2 mg/kg IV according to the Herceptin\u00ae package insert", "arm_group_label": "Cohort 4", "other_name": "trastuzumab", "criteria": "INCLUSION CRITERIA Inclusion Criteria - Histologically confirmed breast cancer with metastases. - Tumor that has overexpression of HER2 as documented by being either FISH-positive or HER2/neu 3+ confirmed by immunohistochemistry. - Patients must be candidates for single agent Herceptin treatment according to the Herceptin\u00ae label.
