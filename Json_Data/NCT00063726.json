{"brief_title": "A Study of PS-341 Given to Patients With Multiple Myeloma Who Experienced Progressive Disease After Receiving Dexamethasone in M34101-039", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to allow patients to receive VELCADE\u2122 (bortezomib) for Injection who experienced progressive disease(PD) while receiving high-dose dexamethasone from the M34101-039 study.", "detailed_description": "The rationale for Amendment 2 is 2-fold. First, it is intended that this study serve as a rollover protocol for patients who experience progressive disease (PD) after receiving the comparator treatment, high-dose dexamethasone, in MPI Study M34101-039, thereby ultimately providing all patients who participate in Study M34101-039 and require treatment for their disease access to VELCADE\u2122 (bortezomib) for Injection, formerly known as MLN341, LDP-341 and PS-341.", "condition": "Multiple Myeloma", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "bortezomib", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria - Patient experienced PD, as defined by SWOG+ criteria during or after treatment with high-dose dexamethasone in MPI Study M34101-039, but has not received alternate anti-neoplastic therapy. Intolerance to high-dose dexamethasone therapy as administered in MPI study M34101-039 does not qualify as PD. - Patient is, in the investigator's opinion, willing and able to comply with the protocol requirements. - Patient has given voluntary written informed consent before performance of any study-related procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to their future medical care. - Female patient is post-menopausal, surgically sterilized, or willing to use acceptable methods of birth control (i.e., a hormonal contraceptive, intra-uterine device, diaphragm with spermicide, condom with spermicide, or abstinence) from Screening through the End of Treatment visit. - Male patient agrees to use an acceptable barrier method for contraception from Screening through the End of Treatment visit. - Patient meets the following pretreatment laboratory criteria at and within 14 days before Baseline (Day 1 of Cycle 1, before study drug administration). (Note that the End of Treatment assessments of MPI study M34101-039 may qualify as the Screening assessments for MPI study M34101-040 if performed within 14 days of the Baseline visit.): - Platelet count \u226520 X 10E+9/L, with or without transfusion support. - Hemoglobin \u22657.0 g/dL, with or without transfusion support. - Absolute neutrophil count (ANC)\u22650.5 x 10E+9/L, without growth factor support. - Serum calcium <14 mg/dL (3.5 mmol/L). - Aspartate transaminase (AST):\u22642.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN). - Alanine transaminase (ALT):\u22642.5 x the ULN. - Total bilirubin:\u22641.5 x the ULN. - If calculated or measured creatinine clearance: \u226520 mL/minute, assessments are as specified in the protocol. If calculated or measured creatinine clearance is <20 mL/minute. Exclusion Criteria - Patient participated in M34101-039 and did not have confirmed PD. Dexamethasone intolerance does not qualify as PD. - Patient had PD on the dexamethasone arm of the MPI Study M34101-039, and then received alternate anti-neoplastic therapy. - Patient has not recovered from dexamethasone-related toxicity experienced during MPI Study M34101-039. - Patient is known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive.(Patients assessed by the investigator to be at risk for HIV infection should be tested in accordance with local regulations.) - Patient is known to be hepatitis B surface antigen-positive or has known active hepatitis C infection.(Patients assessed by the investigator to be at risk for hepatitis B or C infection should be tested in accordance with local regulations.) - Female patient is pregnant or breast-feeding. - Patient developed a new or experienced worsening of an existing illness during or after completion of Study M34101-039 that, in the investigator's opinion, may put the patient at risk of participation in this study.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00063726.xml"}
