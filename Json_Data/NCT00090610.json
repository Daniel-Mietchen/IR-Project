(A patient who has completed 6 cycles of treatment and who has achieved a partial response or stable disease may either continue or stop treatment at the investigator's discretion.) Versus Taxotere\u00ae 30 mg/m2 IV on Days 1 and 8, repeated every 21 days up to 6 cycles or until disease progression. Followed by carboplatin (AUC 6) IV every 21 days if the patient does not achieve a complete response or has disease progression on Taxotere\u00ae. A patient who has achieved a complete response on Taxotere\u00ae will be followed until the subsequent recurrence at which time she will then receive single-agent carboplatin. Carboplatin treatment will be discontinued if the patient has completed 6 cycles of treatment and has achieved a complete response or has disease progression. (A patient who has completed 6 cycles of carboplatin treatment and who has achieved a partial response or stable disease may either continue or stop treatment at the investigator's discretion.) Secondary Objectives The secondary objectives of the study are to compare the objective response rates (defined as a complete response plus partial response), duration of tumor response, median survival, QOL and safety in patients treated with the two regimens described above.", "condition": "Ovarian Cancer", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Carboplatin", "description": "Arm 1: AUC 6 IV on Days 1 and 8, repeated every 21 days for 6 cycles or until disease progression, combined with docetaxel.\nArm 2: AUC 6 IV every 21 days for 6 cycles or until disease progression, following six cycles of treatment with docetaxel", "arm_group_label": "Arm 2 - Sequential Therapy", "other_name": "Paraplatin", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Pathologically confirmed epithelial ovarian cancer, peritoneal serous cancer, or tubal carcinoma. - The patient's tumor is platinum-sensitive, which means that the patient had a complete response to front-line treatment with a platinum compound and had a treatment-free interval without clinical evidence of progressive disease for greater than 6 months. - The patient has received one and only one prior chemotherapy regimen for the treatment of this malignancy. Prior treatment with paclitaxel and/or a platinum compound is allowed. Patients who have received consolidation treatment are allowed. Prior treatment with Taxotere\u00ae is not allowed. o Consolidation therapy is allowed including a different cytotoxic agent than the agent used in the front-line regimen, intraperitoneal therapy, biologic therapy, and immunotherapy. - Patients may have received one prior regimen with a biologic therapy, either combined with cytotoxic therapy in the front-line setting, or as a single-agent for this recurrence. The biologic therapy must be discontinued at least three weeks prior to registration. - Measurable or evaluable disease either by radiologic imaging, or physical exam, or by measurement of CA125 < 70 on two occasions at least one week apart. - At least 3 weeks since radiotherapy, with full recovery. The measurable disease must be completely outside the radiation portal. - At least 3 weeks since major surgery, with full recovery. Patients who have undergone a secondary tumor debulking or cytoreductive surgery for this malignancy are excluded. - Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status < 2. - Age > 18 years. - Absolute neutrophil count > 1,500/mm3; platelet count > 100,000/mm3; Hemoglobin > 8.0 g/dl - Serum bilirubin Within Normal Limits (WNL); AST or ALT and Alkaline Phosphatase must be within the range allowing for eligibility. - If there is childbearing potential, a serum pregnancy test must be negative. - Patients of childbearing potential must be willing to consent to using effective contraception while on treatment and for three months following the completion of treatment. - Informed consent has been obtained. Exclusion Criteria: - Prior treatment with Taxotere\u00ae. - Concurrent immunotherapy or hormonal therapy for the specific purpose of treatment for the disease. Any hormonal therapy directed at the malignant tumor must be discontinued at least one week prior to enrollment in order for the patient to be eligible to participate in this trial. Continuation of Hormone Replacement therapy is permitted. - Serious concurrent medical or psychiatric illness, including serious active infection. - Peripheral neuropathy > grade 2. - History of other malignancy within the last 5 years, except for basal cell skin carcinoma. - The patient is pregnant or nursing. - Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to cisplatin, carboplatin, mannitol, or drugs formulated with Polysorbate 80. - Secondary debulking for this recurrence.", "gender": "Female", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00090610.xml"}
