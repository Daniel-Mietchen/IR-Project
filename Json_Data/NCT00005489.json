This helped to confirm preliminary observations suggesting that salt sensitivity in normotensive subjects predicted the subsequent development of hypertension with aging. In addition, longitudinal observations in hypertensive patients and in normotensives helped to determine whether salt-sensitivity or salt-resistance of blood pressure were associated with differences in the risk for development of specific forms of cardiovascular disease (stroke, angina, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure), renal and metabolic (diabetes mellitus) disorders.", "condition": "Heart Failure", "criteria": "No eligibility criteria", "gender": "Male", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "100 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00005489.xml"}
