{"brief_title": "Genetic Study of Familial Factors in Patients With Colon Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Genetic studies may help in understanding the genetic processes involved in the development of some types of cancer. PURPOSE: Clinical trial to study the cancer-related genes in patients who have colon cancer or adenomatous polyps.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Identify human colon neoplasia susceptibility genes in patients with colon cancer or adenomatous polyps. - Correlate the inheritance of novel susceptibility alleles for adenomatous polyposis of the colon with colon neoplasia in these patients. - Correlate colon neoplasia susceptibility with the presence of COX-2, sPLA2, and DNMT genes in these patients. - Identify a novel gene that governs increased susceptibility to colon adenoma and cancer in the genome of these patients.", "condition": "Colorectal Cancer", "intervention_type": "Genetic", "intervention_name": "microarray analysis", "arm_group_label": "Group 1", "study_pop": "\n      ", "sampling_method": "Non-Probability Sample", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Diagnosis of colon cancer or polyps at age 70 or under - Has a living full sibling with diagnosis of colon cancer or polyps at age 70 or under - No history of familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome - No hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer, according to Amsterdam criteria - No known I1370K adenomatous polyposis of the colon susceptibility variant - Enrolled on 1 of the following clinical trials: - CLB-9581 - CLB-89803 - CLB-80001 NOTE: Patients do not need to be receiving protocol therapy. Patients who are outside the treatment protocol's follow-up range are eligible. Patients who discontinued therapy for any reason, including toxic effects, are eligible.
