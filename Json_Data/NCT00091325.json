{"brief_title": "Green Tea Extract (Polyphenon E) in Preventing Cancer in Healthy Participants", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Green tea extract (Polyphenon E) contains ingredients that may prevent the development of cancer. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying how well green tea extract works in preventing cancer in healthy participants.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the effect of green tea extract (Polyphenon E) on cytochrome P450 enzyme activities and glutathione S-transferase activities and levels in healthy participants. Secondary - Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these participants. OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Participants receive oral green tea extract (Polyphenon E) once daily for 4 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Participants are followed for 2 weeks.
