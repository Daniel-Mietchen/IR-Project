{"brief_title": "S9903: Whole Brain Radiotherapy Followed By Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Limited Malignant Melanoma Brain Metastases", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Stereotactic radiosurgery may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of radiation therapy followed by stereotactic radiosurgery in treating patients who have brain metastases from malignant melanoma.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate the 6 month intracranial progression rate and 6 month overall survival rate in patients with limited brain metastases from malignant melanoma undergoing whole brain radiotherapy followed by stereotactic radiosurgery boost. II. Evaluate the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients undergo whole brain radiotherapy 5 days a week for 3 weeks, followed 3-5 weeks later by stereotactic radiosurgery. Patients are followed every 3 months until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.", "condition": ["Melanoma (Skin)", "Metastatic Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Radiation"], "intervention_name": ["stereotactic radiosurgery"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically proven malignant melanoma at primary or any metastatic site Bidimensionally measurable disease by MRI scan Must have 1-6 enhancing brain metastases If at least 2 lesions are present, only 1 lesion may be greater than 3 cm in maximum diameter PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: Not specified Performance status: SWOG 0-2 Life expectancy: Not specified Hematopoietic: Not specified Hepatic: Not specified Renal: Not specified Other: Not pregnant or nursing Fertile patients must use effective contraception PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: No concurrent biologic response modifier or immunotherapy Chemotherapy: No concurrent chemotherapy with whole brain radiotherapy Prior systemic chemotherapy allowed Endocrine therapy: Not specified Radiotherapy: No prior stereotactic or conventional radiotherapy to any field of the brain Surgery: Prior surgical resection of brain metastases allowed (provided 1 or 2 measurable brain metastases remain)", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "tumors metastatic to brain", "mesh_term": ["Melanoma", "Neoplasm Metastasis"], "id": "NCT00003911"}
