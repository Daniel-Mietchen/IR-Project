{"brief_title": "Fluoride Varnish Randomized Clinical Trial", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of fluoride varnish (FV) applied once or twice a year with counseling to counseling alone in preventing early childhood caries (ECC) (tooth decay in children under the age of five).", "detailed_description": "This project was a prospective, randomized clinical trial (RCT) among initially caries-free children from about six months old (when primary teeth erupt) up to age three at two public health facilities in San Francisco, one serving a primarily Latino and one a primarily Asian population. The RCT 1) Compared the efficacy of once or twice/year fluoride varnish (FV) application and counseling to counseling alone in preventing early childhood caries (ECC); 2) Assessed pre-intervention salivary markers (biologic and chemical), behavioral and demographic factors as predictors of ECC; 3) Compared the efficacy of these interventions between sites serving different ethnic populations with a high prevalence of ECC; and 4) Determined the salivary fluoride release profile following exposure to fluoride varnish.", "condition": ["Dental Caries"], "intervention_type": ["Device"], "intervention_name": ["Fluoride Varnish"], "description": ["0.1 mL (1 drop) applied on each of 2 arches"], "arm_group_label": ["FV every 12mo for 24mo + Counsel", "FV every 6mo for 24mo + Counseling"], "other_name": ["Duraphat\u00ae (Colgate Oral Pharmaceuticals)"], "criteria": "Inclusion - Children < 44 months old - Caries-free - 4 erupted maxillary incisors - Residing in fluoridated community (San Francisco) Exclusion - Cleft Palate - Developmental or learning disabilities - Children with transient residence (homeless, migrant, foster home) - Children with an another household member participating in the study", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "6 Months", "maximum_age": "36 Months", "healthy_volunteers": "Accepts Healthy Volunteers", "keyword": "Early Childhood Caries", "mesh_term": ["Dental Caries", "Fluorides", "Fluorides, Topical"], "id": "NCT00066963"}
