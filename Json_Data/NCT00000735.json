{"brief_title": "A Clinical Trial To Evaluate the Toxicity and Antiviral Effects of a Range of Doses of Ampligen in p24 Antigen Positive HIV-Infected Patients With AIDS or ARC", "brief_summary": "To determine the safety of intravenous infusion of ampligen in symptomatic HIV-infected patients at several dose levels, to determine the maximum dose that can be tolerated, and to measure the effects of ampligen on the HIV virus infection, immune function, and clinical condition. Ampligen is a suitable drug for clinical trials against HIV because it has been shown to stimulate the immune system and to inhibit replication of HIV in vitro at doses that can be achieved without noticeable harmful side effects.", "detailed_description": "Ampligen is a suitable drug for clinical trials against HIV because it has been shown to stimulate the immune system and to inhibit replication of HIV in vitro at doses that can be achieved without noticeable harmful side effects. Patients entered in the study are given ampligen by intravenous infusion at hemophilia treatment centers once during the first week of the trial and twice a week during the following 12 weeks. The dose each patient receives is determined by the responses of earlier patients. If the status of the HIV infection does not improve after the first 13 weeks, ampligen will be stopped. Each patient maintains a daily diary listing any symptoms or problems that occur such as headache, nausea, or change in appetite. Other anti-HIV drugs cannot be taken during the trial, and aspirin or acetaminophen should not be taken for more than 72 hours at any time during the trial without consulting the research staff. Blood will be drawn at intervals during the 13-week trial and 8-week follow-up and used to determine the effect of ampligen on HIV and the immune system as well as to monitor toxicity and side effects.", "condition": "HIV Infections", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Ampligen", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria Hemophiliacs are included.
