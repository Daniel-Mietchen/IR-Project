{"brief_title": "Monoclonal Antibody Therapy, Paclitaxel, and Cyclosporine in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Combining monoclonal antibody therapy with cyclosporine and paclitaxel may be an effective treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of radiolabeled monoclonal antibody therapy combined with paclitaxel and cyclosporine in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of yttrium Y 90 monoclonal antibody Lym-1 in combination with paclitaxel and cyclosporine in patients with recurrent or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of yttrium Y 90 monoclonal antibody Lym-1 (Y90 MOAB Lym-1). Patients receive oral cyclosporine every 12 hours on days -2 to 14. Patients receive unlabeled MOAB Lym-1 IV followed by a tracer dose of indium In 111 MOAB Lym-1 IV on day 0. On day 7, patients receive unlabeled MOAB Lym-1 IV followed by Y90 MOAB Lym-1 IV. Patients in cohorts 2-4 also receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 9. Courses repeat every 8 weeks for a total of 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3 patients receive escalating doses of Y90 MOAB Lym-1 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed monthly for 3 months, every 3 months for 21 months, and then every 6 months for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study within 36 months.", "condition": "Lymphoma", "intervention_type": "Radiation", "intervention_name": "yttrium Y 90 monoclonal antibody Lym-1", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) that has failed standard first-line chemotherapy - Measurable disease - NHL tissue Lym-1 reactive in vitro - Normocellular bone marrow as evidenced by less than 25% of the bone marrow being NHL by bilateral bone marrow biopsy - No bone marrow evidence of myelodysplastic syndrome - HAMA titer negative PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 and over Performance status: - Karnofsky 70-100% Life expectancy: - 3 to 6 months Hematopoietic: - Absolute neutrophil count at least 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 130,000/mm^3 Hepatic: - Bilirubin no greater than 1.5 mg/dL - AST no greater than 84 U/L Renal: - Creatinine less than 1.5 mg/dL OR - Creatinine clearance at least 50 mL/min Cardiovascular: - LVEF at least 50% Pulmonary: - FEV1 at least 60% of predicted - FVC at least 60% of predicted - DLCO at least 50% Other: - No other prior malignancy within the past 5 years except for nonmelanoma skin cancer - HIV negative - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - Not specified Chemotherapy: - See Disease Characteristics - At least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: - Not specified Radiotherapy: - At least 4 weeks since prior external beam radiotherapy Surgery: - Not specified", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00009776.xml"}
