After the first two months, subjects are randomized to the K1, MK4 or placebo groups. Return visits occur at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. Fasting blood and urine is collected at each visit and bone density is performed at 3 study visits.", "condition": ["Osteoporosis"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["phylloquinone (K1)", "menatetranone (MK4)"], "criteria": "- Female, 5 years postmenopause. - Ambulatory. - Community dwelling. - Able to ingest calcium and vitamin D supplements. - Willing to restrict vitamin K intake. - Stable thyroid dose if appropriate. - No history of hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism or other metabolic bone diseases. - Absence of hardware in hip and spine. - History of malignancy within the last five years. - Not currently using coumadin or warfarin. - Vitamin D supplements must be less than 800 IU daily. - Have not used estrogen or other bone-altering medications (see list in study description) within the last year. - No history of liver disease or malabsorption. - No known allergy to vitamin K. - Have not participated in an investigational drug trial within the last month.", "gender": "Female", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "Accepts Healthy Volunteers", "keyword": "Bone Density", "mesh_term": ["Osteoporosis", "Vitamins", "Vitamin K", "Vitamin K 1"], "id": "NCT00062595"}
