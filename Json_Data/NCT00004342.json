Monitor and assess long term safety of primary treatment in SCN patients in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Australia. III. Study the incidence and outcome of adverse events such as osteoporosis, splenomegaly, cytogenetic abnormalities, myelodysplastic syndrome, and leukemia. IV. Evaluate growth and development and hematologic parameters. V. Monitor for clinically significant changes in primary treatment response over time. VI. Establish a physician network to increase the understanding of SCN. VII. Establish a demographic database to allow for future research.", "detailed_description": "PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients are treated by the referring physician as medically indicated.
