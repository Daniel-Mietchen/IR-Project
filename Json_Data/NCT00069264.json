Women of childbearing potential with either a positive pregnancy test at Screening or no pregnancy test. Women of childbearing potential unless (1) surgically sterile or (2) using adequate measures of contraception in the opinion of the Investigator (postmenopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing potential) - Fertile men who are not willing to use contraception or fertile men with a female partner who is not willing to use contraception - Patients who have not successfully completed local therapy for previously treated central nervous system (CNS) metastases and who have not been discontinued from corticosteroids for at least four weeks before starting treatment with E7389. Patients with asymptomatic brain metastases who have no evidence of midline shift on CT scan or MRI may be enrolled without initiation of local therapy for the CNS metastases. In this case, a repeat scan must be performed within four weeks of the original scan to ensure that disease progression is not occurring. - Patients who have tested positive for HIV - Patients with severe uncontrolled intercurrent illness/infection (excluding malignancies) - Patients with uncontrolled cardiovascular illness defined as unstable angina, myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to study entry, symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF) (NYHA II or higher) clinical evidence of CHF, or clinical evidence of serious cardiac arrhythmia - Patients with organ allografts - Patients who have received investigational drugs, including immunotherapy, gene therapy, hormone therapy, or other biologic therapy; anti-neoplastic therapy; or radiation therapy (other than required for palliation) within three weeks of E7389 treatment start - Patients who have had major surgery within four weeks of E7389 treatment start without a full recovery - Patients with a hypersensitivity to Halichondrin B and/or Halichondrin B-like compounds - Patients with other significant disease that, in the Investigator's opinion, would exclude the patient from the study", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "Recurrent Solid Tumors", "mesh_term": ["Neoplasms"], "id": "NCT00069264"}
