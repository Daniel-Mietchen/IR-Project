{"brief_title": "Combination Chemotherapy Followed by Radiation Therapy Before Surgery in Treating Patients With Stage IIIB NSCLC", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy before surgery may shrink the tumor so that it can be removed during surgery. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy before surgery in treating patients who have stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the feasibility and efficacy of sequential neoadjuvant docetaxel, cisplatin, and radiotherapy followed by surgery in patients with operable stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer. - Determine the rate of event-free survival at 1 year in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the operability and complete resection rate in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the postoperative 30-day mortality in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the response rate, failure pattern, and overall survival in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 3 weeks after the last chemotherapy dose, patients without progressive disease receive radiotherapy 1-2 times daily on days 1-5, 8-12, and 15-19. Patients undergo surgery within 3-4 weeks after completion of radiotherapy. Patients are followed at 1 month and then every 3 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-46 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Lung Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Radiation", "Drug", "Procedure"], "intervention_name": ["Hyperfractionated", "Taxotere/Cisplatin", "conventional surgery"], "description": ["Hyperfractionated radiotherapy", "Taxotere/Cisplatin", "conventional surgery"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed, operable stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer - T4 N0-3 M0 or T1-4 N3 M0 by bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy (required for assessment of N3 disease) or CT scan or MRI of the thorax - Squamous cell - Adenosquamous cell - Large cell - Poorly differentiated - No prior or concurrent metastatic disease by CT scan or MRI of the brain, bone scan, and abdominal ultrasound or CT scan - No malignant pleural or pericardial effusion - No invasion of the aorta, esophagus, myocardium, or supraclavicular nodes PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 to 75 Performance status: - WHO 0-1 Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - WBC at least 4,000/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 100,000/mm^3 Hepatic: - Bilirubin normal - AST and/or ALT no greater than 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) - Alkaline phosphatase no greater than 2.5 times ULN Renal: - Creatinine clearance at least 60 mL/min Cardiovascular: - No unstable cardiac disease requiring treatment - No congestive heart failure - No angina pectoris (even if medically controlled) - No significant arrhythmia - No myocardial infarction within the past 3 months Other: - Not pregnant or nursing - Fertile patients must use effective contraception - No definite contraindications for the use of corticosteroids as premedication - No preexisting grade 2 or greater peripheral neuropathy - No active uncontrolled infection - No uncontrolled diabetes mellitus - No other prior or concurrent malignancy except non-melanomatous skin cancer or adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix - No prior significant neurologic or psychiatric disorders including psychotic disorders, dementia, or seizures that would preclude informed consent - No other serious underlying medical condition that would preclude study participation - No socioeconomic or geographical circumstances that would preclude study compliance PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - Not specified Chemotherapy: - Not specified Endocrine therapy: - No concurrent corticosteroids except as prophylactic pretreatment medication, treatment for acute hypersensitivity reactions, or chronic treatment (initiated more than 6 months ago) at low-dose (no more than 20 mg methylprednisolone or equivalent) Radiotherapy: - No prior radiotherapy to the chest Surgery: - See Disease Characteristics Other: - At least 30 days since prior treatment in a clinical trial - No prior cytostatic therapy - No other concurrent experimental drugs", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "75 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "adenosquamous cell lung cancer", "mesh_term": ["Lung Neoplasms", "Docetaxel", "Cisplatin"], "id": "NCT00030810"}
