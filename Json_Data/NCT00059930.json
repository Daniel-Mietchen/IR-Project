{"brief_title": "Adjuvant Hepatic Arterial Infusion and Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Resectable Hepatic Metastases From Colorectal Cancer", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to find the highest dose that can be given safely to people who have had liver disease resected. This is a Phase I study. The goal of a phase I study is to find a safe dose range based on side effects. The drugs that will be given by vein are OXALIPLATIN (\"Oxali\") plus 5-FLUOROURACIL and LEUCOVORIN (\"5FU\" and \"LV\"). This is systemic chemotherapy, since it goes to the whole body. The drugs that will be placed in the pump are FLOXURIDINE (FUDR) and DEXAMETHASONE. (The dexamethasone is not an anti-tumor drug; it helps protect healthy liver tissue from possible side effects of the FUDR.) This is the regional chemotherapy, since it goes only to the liver. The researchers have studied these drugs and know the best doses of each when they are used in patients who have not had liver resections. We do not yet know how the drugs work with each other in patients with a liver resection. This study will tell us the best doses of each drug when they are given over the same period of time.", "condition": ["Colorectal Cancer", "Metastatic Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Drug", "Drug", "Drug", "Drug", "Procedure", "Procedure"], "intervention_name": ["FOLFOX regimen", "dexamethasone", "floxuridine", "fluorouracil", "leucovorin calcium", "oxaliplatin", "adjuvant therapy", "conventional surgery"], "arm_group_label": ["Adjuvant Hepatic Arterial Infusion & Combination Chemotherapy", "Adjuvant Hepatic Arterial Infusion & Combination Chemotherapy", "Adjuvant Hepatic Arterial Infusion & Combination Chemotherapy", "Adjuvant Hepatic Arterial Infusion & Combination Chemotherapy", "Adjuvant Hepatic Arterial Infusion & Combination Chemotherapy", "Adjuvant Hepatic Arterial Infusion & Combination Chemotherapy", "Adjuvant Hepatic Arterial Infusion & Combination Chemotherapy", "Adjuvant Hepatic Arterial Infusion & Combination Chemotherapy"], "criteria": "Subject Inclusion Criteria: - History of histologically confirmed colorectal adenocarcinoma metastatic to the liver with no clinical or radiographic evidence of extrahepatic disease.
