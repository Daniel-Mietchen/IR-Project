Compare the benefit of exercise versus usual care (no exercise) on impairments and functional limitations in patients with Parkinson disease.", "detailed_description": "PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients assigned to the Axial Mobility Exercise Program participate 3 times a week for 10 weeks. The program consists of individualized exercises specifically directed toward restoration of axial mobility in the context of functional tasks.
