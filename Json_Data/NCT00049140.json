{"brief_title": "EF5 Compared With Other Methods of Detecting Oxygen Levels in Tumor Cells of Patients With Head and Neck Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures using the drug EF5 to detect the presence of oxygen in tumor cells may help to plan effective treatment for solid tumors. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to compare diagnostic procedures using EF5 to that of other methods of detecting oxygen levels in tumor cells of patients who have head and neck cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the distribution, degree, and intrapatient and interpatient heterogeneity of hypoxia, as measured by EF5 binding in tumor tissue, in patients with head and neck cancer. - Determine the distribution and intrapatient and interpatient heterogeneity of CA9 expression, as measured immunohistochemically, in these patients. - Determine the distribution, concentration, and intrapatient and interpatient heterogeneity of glucose and lactate, as measured by bioluminescence imaging, in these patients. - Determine whether there is spatial coordination between concentrations of lactate and glucose and the location of tissue hypoxia in these patients. - Determine whether there is spatial coordination between the location of CA9 with hypoxia and/or lactate concentrations in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive EF5 IV over 1-2.5 hours on day 1. Within 24-55 hours after EF5 infusion, patients undergo surgery. Tumor tissue samples are examined for EF5 binding by immunohistochemistry, bioluminescence imaging, and flow cytometry. Patients are followed at 1 month and then for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.", "condition": ["Head and Neck Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Other", "Other", "Other", "Procedure"], "intervention_name": ["EF5", "bioluminescence", "flow cytometry", "immunohistochemistry staining method", "biopsy"], "arm_group_label": ["EF5", "EF5", "EF5", "EF5", "EF5"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck - Clinically detectable disease by physical examination or radiographic studies - Scheduled to undergo surgical resection of tumor or radiotherapeutic treatment PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - 18 and over Performance status - Karnofsky 70-100% Life expectancy - Not specified Hematopoietic - WBC greater than 3,000/mm^3 - Platelet count greater than 100,000/mm^3 Hepatic - Bilirubin no greater than 1.5 mg/dL Renal - Creatinine no greater than 1.8 mg/dL Other - No allergy to IV contrast dye - No prior grade III or IV peripheral neuropathy - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception during and for 1 week after study participation PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - Not specified Chemotherapy - Not specified Endocrine therapy - Not specified Radiotherapy - See Disease Characteristics - Concurrent radiotherapy allowed Surgery - See Disease Characteristics", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "salivary gland squamous cell carcinoma", "mesh_term": ["Head and Neck Neoplasms"], "id": "NCT00049140"}
