{"brief_title": "Biological Therapy in Treating Patients With Advanced Myelodysplastic Syndrome, Acute or Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, or Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Who Are Undergoing Stem Cell Transplantation", "brief_summary": "This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of biological therapy and to see how well it works in treating patients with advanced myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic myeloid leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, or acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Biological therapies, including immunotherapy, can potentially be used to stimulate the immune system and stop cancer cells from growing. Immunotherapy given to patients who have undergone donor stem cell transplantation may be a way to eradicate remaining cancer cells", "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the safety and potential toxicities associated with infusing donor CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clones specific for Wilms' tumor (WT1) in patients who have relapsed or at a high risk of relapse post transplant for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the in vivo persistence of transferred T cells and assess migration to the bone marrow, a predominant site of leukemic relapse. II. To determine if adoptively transferred WT1-specific T cells mediate antileukemic activity. OUTLINE: Donors undergo leukapheresis for stem cell harvest to generate CD8-positive WT1 gene-specific CTL clones at the time of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. After post-transplantation hematopoietic recovery, patients receive treatment for either highest-risk disease (prophylactically) or relapsed disease. Highest-risk disease group: Patients receive CD8-positive WT1 gene-specific CTL clones intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours on days 0, 14, and 28. Beginning 2-4 hours after CTL infusion, patients receive interleukin-2 subcutaneously (SC) twice daily on days 28-42 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Relapsed-disease group: Some patients with evidence of leukemic relapse may receive standard salvage chemotherapy prior to donor CTL infusions and then receive CD8-positive WT1 gene-specific CTL clones and interleukin-2 as in the highest-risk group. Patients in both groups who have progressive disease after complete or partial response to therapy may be eligible for retreatment with CD8-positive WT1 gene-specific CTL clones. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years.", "condition": ["Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia With 11q23 (MLL) Abnormalities", "Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia With Inv(16)(p13;q22)", "Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia With t(15;17)(q22;q12)", "Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia With t(16;16)(p13;q22)", "Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia With t(8;21)(q22;q22)", "B-cell Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia", "B-cell Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia", "Childhood Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia", "Childhood Myelodysplastic Syndromes", "Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia", "Essential Thrombocythemia", "Polycythemia Vera", "Previously Treated Myelodysplastic Syndromes", "Recurrent Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia", "Recurrent Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia", "Recurrent Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia", "Recurrent Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia", "Refractory Anemia With Excess Blasts", "Refractory Anemia With Excess Blasts in Transformation", "Relapsing Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia", "Secondary Acute Myeloid Leukemia", "T-cell Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia", "T-cell Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia"], "intervention_type": ["Biological", "Biological", "Procedure", "Procedure", "Other", "Genetic", "Other", "Other", "Genetic", "Genetic", "Other"], "intervention_name": ["therapeutic allogeneic lymphocytes", "aldesleukin", "peripheral blood stem cell transplantation", "allogeneic bone marrow transplantation", "laboratory biomarker analysis", "gene expression analysis", "immunologic technique", "flow cytometry", "polymerase chain reaction", "cytogenetic analysis", "staining method"], "description": ["Given IV", "Given SC", "Undergo transplantation", "Undergo transplantation", "Correlative studies", "Correlative studies", "Correlative studies", "Correlative studies", "Correlative studies", "Correlative studies", "Correlative studies"], "arm_group_label": ["Treatment", "Treatment", "Treatment", "Treatment", "Treatment", "Treatment", "Treatment", "Treatment", "Treatment", "Treatment", "Treatment"], "other_name": ["ALLOLYMPH", "IL-2", "Proleukin", "recombinant human interleukin-2", "recombinant interleukin-2", "PBPC transplantation", "PBSC transplantation", "peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation", "transplantation, peripheral blood stem cell", "bone marrow therapy, allogeneic", "bone marrow therapy, allogenic", "transplantation, allogeneic bone marrow", "transplantation, allogenic bone marrow", "immunological laboratory methods", "laboratory methods, immunological", "PCR", "Staining"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Eligibility for Enrollment: - a. - i) Pre-transplant: Patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-t), CML beyond chronic phase, AML beyond first remission, Philadelphia chromosome (BCR-ABL)-positive ALL at any stage, any ALL beyond first remission, primary refractory AML or ALL, therapy-related AML at any stage, or acute leukemia at any stage arising in a patient with an antecedent diagnosis of a myelodysplastic or myeloproliferative syndrome (including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, CML, polycythemia vera, essential thrombocytosis, and agnogenic myeloid metaplasia with myelofibrosis); - ii) Post-transplant: Patients who have relapsed after transplant (morphologic, flow cytometric, cytogenetic and molecular relapse) can be offered enrollment on the protocol and may undergo therapy if it is considered possible to control their disease while waiting for the generation of study therapy - b.
