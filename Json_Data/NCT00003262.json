{"brief_title": "Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Hodgkin's Disease and HIV Infection", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of two combination chemotherapy regimens in treating patients with Hodgkin's disease and HIV infection.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Investigate the effects on survival, life expectancy and quality, toxicity, and immunological status in low risk patients with Hodgkin's Disease and HIV infection treated with the Stanford V regimen and in high risk patients treated with epirubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and prednisone. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified into 2 groups designated as low and high risk on the basis of ECOG performance status (0-2 vs 3-4), presence or absence of AIDS before the diagnosis of Hodgkin's Disease, and immune status (CD4+ cell count greater vs no greater than 100/mm^3). - Low risk patients (those with no risk factors) receive the EBVP regimen, as follows: - Epirubicin intravenously on day 1 - Bleomycin intramuscularly or intravenously on day 1 - Vinblastine intravenously on day 1 - Prednisone orally on days 1-5 - Patients also receive daily injections of filgrastim (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; G-CSF) on days 6-15. This schedule is repeated every 3 weeks for 6 courses. - High risk patients (those with one or more risk factors) receive the Stanford V regimen, as follows: - Doxorubicin and vinblastine intravenously on days 1 and 15 - Mechlorethamine intravenously on day 1 - Vincristine and bleomycin intravenously on days 8 and 22 - Etoposide intravenously on days 15 and 16 - Prednisone orally daily - Patients also receive daily injections of G-CSF on days 3-7, 9-13, 17-21, and 23-26. This schedule is repeated every 28 days for 3 courses. Patients are followed every 2 months the first year and then every 3 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 20-30 patients will initially be accrued in this study.", "condition": "Lymphoma", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "vincristine sulfate", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically proven Hodgkin's disease: - Clinical or pathologic stage II - IV - Stage I with bulky disease (tumor size greater than 10 cm) and B symptoms - Confirmed HIV infection PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 and over Performance status: - WHO 0-4 Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - Not specified Hepatic: - Not specified Renal: - Not specified Cardiovascular: - No severe cardiac disease Pulmonary: - No severe pulmonary disease Other: - No severe neurologic or metabolic disease - No concurrent or prior second malignancy except: - Nonmelanomatous skin cancer - In situ cancer of the cervix PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - Not specified Chemotherapy - Not specified Endocrine therapy - Not specified Radiotherapy - Not specified Surgery - Not specified Other - No prior therapy for Hodgkin's disease - Concurrent triple-drug antiretroviral therapy (including one protease inhibitor) required", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00003262.xml"}
