{"brief_title": "Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Stage I, II, or IIIA Non-small Cell Lung Cancer That Has Been Surgically Removed", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare cisplatin and etoposide with no chemotherapy in treating patients who have stage I, stage II, or stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer that has been surgically removed.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Assess the efficacy of the combination of cisplatin and etoposide after radical surgery in prolonging the relapse free and overall survival for stages I, II, and IIIA non-small cell lung cancer. OUTLINE: This a randomized study (treatment vs no treatment). Patients are stratified according to sex and to stage of disease (I vs II vs IIIA). Patient receives cisplatin and etoposide on days 1-3, every 28 days, for 3 cycles. Patient may receive radiation therapy after surgery at the discretion of the physician. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 750 patients will be accrued over 3 years.", "condition": ["Lung Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Procedure"], "intervention_name": ["cisplatin", "etoposide", "adjuvant therapy"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically proven stage I, II, or IIIA non-small cell lung cancer after radical surgery - No evidence of lymphonodal enlargement during postsurgical chest CT scan PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 70 and under Performance status: - ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - WBC at least 3,500/mm3 - Platelet count at least 100,000/mm3 Hepatic: - Not specified Renal: - Creatinine no greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal Pulmonary: - FEV1 at least 1 liter Other: - Less than 10% weight loss in the past 3 months - No prior malignancy except nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - Not specified Chemotherapy: - Not specified Endocrine therapy: - Not specified Radiotherapy: - Not specified Surgery: - Radical surgery required", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "70 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer", "mesh_term": ["Lung Neoplasms", "Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung", "Etoposide"], "id": "NCT00003053"}
