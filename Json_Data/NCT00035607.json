{"brief_title": "Chemotherapy Related Anemia", "brief_summary": "This study is investigating darbepoetin alfa for the treatment of anemia in patients with non-myeloid cancers who are receiving chemotherapy. Darbepoetin alfa is a recombinant protein that stimulates the production of red blood cells. In this study, darbepoetin alfa will be administered as either an injection under the skin (subcutaneously) or directly into a vein (intravenously).", "condition": ["Anemia", "Non-Myeloid Malignancies"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Darbepoetin alfa SC", "Darbepoetin alfa IV"], "description": ["Subcutaneous (SC) injection of darbepoetin alfa at 4.5 mcg/kg weekly for weeks 1-6, then 4.5 mcg/kg Q3W", "Intravenous administration of darbepoetin alfa at 4.5 mcg/kg weekly for weeks 1-6, then 4.5 mcg/kg Q3W"], "arm_group_label": ["Darbepoetin alfa SC", "Darbepoetin alfa IV"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Diagnosed with a non-myeloid malignancy - Scheduled to receive a minimum of an additional 12 weeks of chemotherapy from the time of first dose of study drug - Screening hemoglobin concentration less than or equal to 11.0g/dL - ECOG performance status of 0 to 2 - Adequate renal and liver function Exclusion Criteria: - History of seizure disorder - Received recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) or darbepoetin alfa therapy within 4 weeks before study day 1 - More than 2 red blood cell transfusions within 4 weeks before study day 1, or any red blood cell transfusion within 14 days before study day 1", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "mesh_term": ["Anemia", "Neoplasms", "Darbepoetin alfa"], "id": "NCT00035607"}
