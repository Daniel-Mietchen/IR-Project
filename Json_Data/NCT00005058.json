{"brief_title": "Enhanced Ultrasound in Determining Extent of Disease in Women With Primary Breast Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: New imaging procedures, such as enhanced ultrasound may improve the ability to determine the extent of breast cancer. PURPOSE: Diagnostic study of enhanced ultrasound in women who have locally advanced primary breast cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: I. Measure blood flow of primary breast lesions and corresponding lymph nodes by Power Doppler Ultrasound (PDU) and compare this information with metastatic potential and patient survival in women with primary breast cancer. II. Correlate intratumor/-nodal blood flow with pathological variables using standard histology and special stains in this patient population. III. Correlate intratumor microvessel density with total tumor blood flow and with the presence of axillary lymph node metastases using this diagnostic method in these patients. IV. Correlate tumor blood flow with various markers of angiogenesis using this diagnostic method in these patients. V. Compare tumor blood flow as measured with PDU before and after contrast enhancement in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a diagnostic study. Patients receive ultrasound contrast agent IV. An ultrasound probe with Power Doppler facility is swept over the skin surface in a standard fashion before and after contrast enhancement. Blood flow data is acquired over the volume of the mass and/or lymph nodes using a video recorder. The scanning time ranges between 5 to 15 minutes depending on the size and exact location of the breast mass and axillary lymph nodes. Within 1 week of the ultrasound, patients undergo surgery and the mass and axillary lymph nodes are removed. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 200 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.", "condition": ["Breast Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Procedure"], "intervention_name": ["ultrasound imaging"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Clinically suspected locally advanced breast cancer where treatment indicated is primary surgery (wide local excision or simple mastectomy) and axillary dissection (clearance) Inflammatory breast cancer eligible No recurrent disease Hormone receptor status: Not specified PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: 18 and over Sex: Female Menopausal status: Not specified Performance status: Not specified Life expectancy: Not specified Hematopoietic: Not specified Hepatic: Not specified Renal: Not specified Cardiovascular: No New York Heart Association class III or IV heart disease At least 14 days since prior myocardial infarction Pulmonary: No severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Other: No galactosemia No mental illness or handicap PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: Not specified Chemotherapy: No prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: Not specified Radiotherapy: Not specified Surgery: See Disease Characteristics At least 1 month since prior core biopsy (Tru-cut) of breast cancer", "gender": "Female", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "inflammatory breast cancer", "mesh_term": ["Breast Neoplasms"], "id": "NCT00005058"}
