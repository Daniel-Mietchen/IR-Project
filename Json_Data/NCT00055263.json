{"brief_title": "A New Formulation of Calcitriol (DN-101) in Patients With Advanced Malignancies", "brief_summary": "The purposes of this study are to: - Test the safety of DN-101 in patients with advanced malignancies - Understand how fast the body absorbs, processes, and eliminates DN-101 - Determine the highest dose of DN-101 that is well tolerated by cancer patients - Learn how fast the body absorbs, processes, and eliminates DN-101 compared to the approved product", "detailed_description": "Calcitriol, at low doses, is approved by the FDA for use in patients with chronic renal failure. However, much higher doses of calcitriol are needed for any possible anti-cancer effect. DN-101 is a new capsule that contains 30 times the amount of calcitriol found in the currently available calcitriol capsule. In order to take an amount of calcitriol equivalent to 1 capsule of DN-101, cancer patients would need to swallow 30 pills of the approved, low dose formulation. DN-101 is a pill containing calcitriol, a chemical related to vitamin D that is immediately active in your body. The natural vitamin D found in dairy products or in typical vitamin pills, must be chemically changed by your liver and kidney into calcitriol before it is active. High doses of calcitriol had anti-cancer effects when tested in animals. DN-101 may have anticancer effects in your kind of cancer.", "condition": ["Neoplasms"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["DN-101"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria Patients must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for participation in this study: - Patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies - Patients with prostate cancer are eligible 1) if they have had a prostatectomy or radiation therapy and have a rising PSA, 2) if they have androgen sensitive prostate cancer and are on hormone therapy, or 3) if they have androgen independent prostate cancer and have failed hormone therapy - Patients with other types of malignancies will be required to have failed at least one potentially effective therapy prior to study entry - Life expectancy > 3 months - Age > 18 years - The following laboratory results: - Adequate hematologic function - Adequate renal function - Adequate liver function - Negative urine pregnancy test (females of childbearing potential only) - Willingness to use effective contraception by both males and females throughout the treatment period and for at least 2 months following treatment - Signed informed consent form Exclusion Criteria Patients who meet any of the following exclusion criteria are not to be enrolled in this study: - Significant active medical illness (other than current cancer) which in the opinion of the investigator would preclude protocol treatment - History of cancer-related hypercalcemia, known hypercalcemia, or vitamin D toxicity - Uncontrolled heart failure - Kidney stones (calcium salt) within the past 5 years - Prior investigational therapy within the past 30 days - Prior use of calcitriol within the past 3 months or known hypersensitivity to calcitriol - Concurrent active treatment for cancer with the exception of treatment for androgen-independent prostate cancer - Excluded concomitant medications: calcium- or magnesium-containing antacids, bile-resin binders, bisphosphonates, or calcium supplements; ketoconazole or related compounds", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "advanced solid tumor malignancies", "mesh_term": ["Calcitriol"], "id": "NCT00055263"}
