{"brief_title": "Study Evaluating MAC-321 in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Refractory to Platinum-based Therapy", "brief_summary": "This non-randomized, open-label clinical trial is designed to determine safety and clinical activity of a new chemotherapeutic agent, MAC-321, when given intravenously to patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Clinical activity will be evaluated by determining the percentage of patients with an objective tumor response after treatment with MAC-321. Patients must have been previously treated with a platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen. A total of 96 patients will be enrolled in this trial. Eligible patients will receive MAC-321 intravenously every 3 weeks for up to a total of 6 courses of treatment. All patients will receive MAC-321 at the same dose. MAC-321 is an experimental drug, and is not offered outside of this research trial.", "condition": "Lung Neoplasms", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "MAC-321", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Recurrence of non-small cell lung cancer after at least 1 prior chemotherapy regimen containing a platinum agent - Recovery from all acute side effects of prior therapies (with the exception of hair loss) - Adequate bone marrow, liver, and kidney function Exclusion Criteria: - More than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens for treatment of advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.
