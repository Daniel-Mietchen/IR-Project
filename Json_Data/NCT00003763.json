{"brief_title": "Radiolabeled Folic Acid and Imaging to Detect Ovarian Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures using the drug radiolabeled folic acid and imaging may be effective in detecting ovarian cancer. PURPOSE: Diagnostic trial to study the effectiveness of radiolabeled folic acid plus imaging in detecting ovarian cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the effectiveness of folic acid conjugated with indium In 111 to diagnose ovarian cancer and locate metastatic disease. OUTLINE: This is a diagnostic study. Patients receive an injection of folic acid conjugated with indium In 111. The patient then undergoes imaging studies at various time points (e.g., 1, 4, and 24 hours). Patients then undergo exploratory surgery, the results of which are then compared to the imaging studies. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": "Ovarian Cancer", "intervention_type": "Radiation", "intervention_name": "indium In 111 folic acid", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Suspected ovarian cancer OR Recurrence of ovarian cancer Scheduled for exploratory surgery PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: 18 and over Performance status: Zubrod 0-2 Life expectancy: Not specified Hematopoietic: WBC at least 3000/mm3 Granulocyte count at least 1500/mm3 Platelet count at least 100,000/mm3 Hemoglobin at least 9 g/dL Hepatic: Bilirubin no greater than 2.0 mg/dL SGPT and SGOT no greater than 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) Alkaline phosphatase no greater than 2 times ULN No acute hepatitis Renal: Creatinine no greater than 1.4 mg/dL BUN no greater than 1.5 times ULN No known or suspected kidney disease Cardiovascular: No history of congestive heart failure No unstable angina No myocardial infarction within 6 months Other: Not pregnant or nursing No septicemia or severe infection No medical condition that would preclude the administration of large fluid volumes over a short period of time PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: Not specified Chemotherapy: At least 3 months since prior cytotoxic chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: Not specified Radiotherapy: At least 3 months since prior radiotherapy Surgery: See Disease Characteristics Other: At least 2 days since prior folic acid supplements At least 5 days since nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications", "gender": "Female", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "120 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00003763.xml"}
