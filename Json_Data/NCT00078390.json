The first part of the study is a Phase I design to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose of S-3304 when given in combination with radiation and paclitaxel/carboplatin chemotherapy that is appropriate for further evaluation. The second part of the study is a randomized Phase II design to evaluate the efficacy of recommended S-3304 dose in combination with chemo-radiation.", "condition": ["Non Small Cell Lung Cancer", "Lung Cancer", "Stage IIIA Non Small Cell Lung Cancer", "Stage IIIB Non Small Cell Lung Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["S-3304"], "criteria": "INCLUSION CRITERIA - newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer of stage IIIA non-resectable or of stage IIIB without pleural effusion - ECOG performance status 0-1 - adequate organ function - clinically indicated and able to receive conventional chemoradiation therapy EXCLUSION CRITERIA - patients with prior history of cancer, other than basal cell carcinoma after appropriate treatment, or prior systemic chemotherapy treatment - patients with other serious intercurrent illness including HIV/AIDS, or contraindicated for paclitaxel/carboplatin or thoracic irradiation treatment", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "85 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "Unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer", "mesh_term": ["Lung Neoplasms", "Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung", "S 3304"], "id": "NCT00078390"}
