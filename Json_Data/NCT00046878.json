{"brief_title": "Carmustine and O(6)-Benzylguanine in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Supratentorial Glioblastoma Multiforme", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. O(6)-benzylguanine may increase the effectiveness of carmustine by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining carmustine with O(6)-benzylguanine in treating patients who have newly diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the activity of carmustine and O6-benzylguanine in patients with newly diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme not requiring immediate radiotherapy. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive O6-benzylguanine IV over 1 hour followed approximately 1 hour later by carmustine IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for a maximum of 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are then referred for radiotherapy. Patients who demonstrate tumor response after completion of the third course of chemotherapy receive 6 additional courses after completion of radiotherapy. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-36 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": "Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "carmustine", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed newly diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme not requiring immediate radiotherapy - Measurable residual disease on a contrast-enhanced MRI or CT scan (for patients with a medical contraindication for MRI) with a baseline scan obtained at the corticosteroid dose the patient is receiving on the day of treatment PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - 18 and over Performance status - Karnofsky 60-100% Life expectancy - Not specified Hematopoietic - Absolute granulocyte count at least 1,500/mm3 - Platelet count at least 100,000/mm3 - Hemoglobin greater than 10 g/dL Hepatic - Bilirubin normal - SGOT no greater than 2.5 times upper limit of normal Renal - Creatinine no greater than 1.5 mg/dL - BUN no greater than 25 mg/dL Pulmonary - DLCO greater than 75% predicted Other - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception during and for 2 months after study PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - Not specified Chemotherapy - Not specified Endocrine therapy - See Disease Characteristics - Concurrent corticosteroids allowed if on stable dose for 3 days before study Radiotherapy - See Disease Characteristics Surgery - No more than 28 days since prior surgical resection or biopsy", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00046878.xml"}
