{"brief_title": "A Phase I/II Trial to Assess the Safety and Tolerance of Escalating Doses of a Human Anti-Cytomegalovirus Monoclonal Antibody (SDZ MSL-109) in Patients With the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome and CMV Retinitis", "brief_summary": "To determine the safety and tolerance of 3 dosage levels of human anti-cytomegalovirus (CMV) monoclonal antibody (SDZ MSL-109) when administered once every 2 weeks for a total of 8 doses during the maintenance phase of ganciclovir (DHPG) therapy to patients with AIDS and documented evidence of CMV retinitis. In addition for those patients with positive CMV cultures upon entry into this trial a preliminary attempt will be made to assess the potential in vivo antiviral effects of the concomitant administration of DHPG and SDZ MSL-109.", "condition": ["Cytomegalovirus Retinitis", "HIV Infections"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Sevirumab"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria Concurrent Medication: Allowed: - Zidovudine (AZT) < 600 mg/day. - Experimental maintenance or prophylactic therapy with an approved therapeutic agent for a non-viral opportunistic infection. - Trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole (TMP / SMX). - Pyrimethamine / sulfadoxine. - Aerosolized pentamidine. - Ketoconazole. - Flucytosine (5-FC). - Antituberculosis therapy.
