{"brief_title": "Music Therapy to Ease Pain and Emotional Distress in Patients With Hematologic Cancer Who Are Undergoing High-Dose Therapy and Stem Cell Transplantation", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Music therapy may be effective in relieving pain and emotional distress in patients who are undergoing cancer therapy. PURPOSE: Randomized trial to determine the effectiveness of music therapy to ease pain and emotional distress in patients with hematologic cancer who are undergoing high-dose therapy and stem cell transplantation.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Compare the effects of music therapy vs no music therapy on depression and anxiety in patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. - Compare the effects of these regimens on mood, mucositis pain, pain interference, need for analgesic medication, and length of hospital stay of these patients. - Compare the immediate effects of these regimens on mood in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to whole body or whole lymphatic irradiation (yes vs no) and diagnosis (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma vs Hodgkin's lymphoma vs myeloma/amyloidosis). Patients are randomized to one of two arms. - Arm I: Patients receive individualized music therapy over 20-30 minutes beginning on day 0 and continuing over 16 days for a maximum of 12 sessions during high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. Patients complete a Profile of Mood States (POMS) quality of life and pain questionnaire on days -2, 0, 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, and 16. - Arm II: Patients receive standard psychosocial support during high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. Patients complete POMS and mucositis pain questionnaires as in arm I. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients (40 per arm) will be accrued for this study.", "condition": "Pain", "intervention_type": "Procedure", "intervention_name": "psychosocial assessment and care", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Diagnosis of a hematologic malignancy - No leukemia - Planned high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (HDT/ASCT) at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 and over Performance status: - Not specified Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - Not specified Hepatic: - Not specified Renal: - Not specified PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - See Disease Characteristics - No prior HDT/ASCT Chemotherapy: - See Disease Characteristics Endocrine therapy: - Not specified Radiotherapy: - Not specified Surgery: - Not specified", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00014482.xml"}
