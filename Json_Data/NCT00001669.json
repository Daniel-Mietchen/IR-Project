{"brief_title": "A 48-Week (24-Week Baseline Followed by a 24-Week Treatment) Phase II Pilot Study of the Tolerability and Effect/Efficacy of Subcutaneously Administered Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 (rhIGF) (CEP-151) in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Patients", "brief_summary": "The drug rhIGF-1 (CEP-151) has been shown to play a key role preclinically in oligodendrocyte differentiation and survival, as well as, myelin integrity and function. Moreover, in an animal model of MS, myelin expression, as well as that of its receptors is upregulated at the time the myelin sheaths regenerate. Finally, administration of exogenous rhIGF-1 to rats with EAE effectively, closes the disrupted BBB, reduces the number and severity of demyelinating lesions, and improves neurological function. Thus it seems reasonable to examine the efficacy and safety, tolerability, and effect of CEP-151 on brain MRI lesions in patients with MS.", "detailed_description": "The drug rhIGF-1 (CEP-151) has been shown to play a key role preclinically in oligodendrocyte differentiation and survival, as well as, myelin integrity and function.

Male patients should also receive adequate counseling and exercise adequate contraception. No clinically significant abnormalities on the prestudy laboratory evaluations, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), chest x-ray, mammogram or ophthalmologic exam. No connective tissue or rheumatic disorder (systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE] ; rheumatoid arthritis [RA]; progressive systemic sclerosis [PSS]; Sjogren's syndrome [SS]). Patient may not be HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), HTLV-1 (human T cell leukemia virus), or HB/C Ag (hepatitis B or C surface antigen) positive. No history of insulin-producing tumors or reactive hypoglycemia. No clinically significant medical condition (e.g., within 6 months of screen had myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, untreated hypertension, and/or congestive heart failure [CHF] that, in the opinion of the investigator would compromise the safety of the patient. Ability to tolerate MRI examinations due to claustrophobia, or have contraindications to MRI scanning, such as pacemakers, aneurysm clips, or shrapnel fragments. Welders and metal workers must have radiographic evidence to document lack of foreign bodies in the eyes or they will be excluded, due to the risk of eye injury while in the MRI machine. No history of substance use disorder (DSM-IV criteria) within the past two years. No Type I or Type II diabetes treated with hypoglycemic agents (diet-controlled Type II diabetes may be included.) No history of cancer (with the exception of localized skin cancers with no evidence of metastasis, significant invasion, or recurrence) within three years of screening. No first or second degree relatives with breast cancer. Have not used an investigational drug within 30 days of the screen visit. Have previously received interferon-alpha, interferon-beta, copolymer 1, cyclophosphamide, intravenous immunoglobulin, oral myelin, or other immunosuppressive drugs within 6 months of screen.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "Multiple Sclerosis", "mesh_term": ["Sclerosis", "Multiple Sclerosis", "Mitogens"], "id": "NCT00001669"}
