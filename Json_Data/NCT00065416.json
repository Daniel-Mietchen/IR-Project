{"brief_title": "Evaluating Therapeutic Massage for Chronic Neck Pain", "brief_summary": "This study will provide the basis for a full-scale trial to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of therapeutic massage for chronic neck pain (CNP).", "detailed_description": "Neck pain is one of the most common problems affecting the health of Americans and is a leading reason for using complementary or alternative medical (CAM) therapies. Therapeutic massage is one of the most popular CAM treatments for neck pain, but little is known about its effectiveness. This study will lay the groundwork for a full-scale trial that evaluates the effectiveness of therapeutic massage for chronic neck pain. The study will involve two phases. During Phase I, researchers will develop and pre-test key components for a randomized clinical trial. In Phase II, the safety and efficacy of massage for CNP will be evaluated. The changes in symptoms, function, and quality of life in massage and self care groups will be evaluated midway through treatment, at the end of treatment and at 6 months post randomization.", "condition": ["Neck Pain", "Cervicalgia"], "intervention_type": ["Procedure"], "intervention_name": ["massage"], "criteria": "The inclusion and exclusion criteria will be developed through consultation with a medical expert on neck pain and several massage consultants", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "20 Years", "maximum_age": "64 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "massage", "mesh_term": ["Neck Pain"], "id": "NCT00065416"}
