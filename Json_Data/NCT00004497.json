{"brief_title": "Phase III Randomized Study of UT-15 in Patients With Primary Pulmonary Hypertension", "brief_summary": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety and efficacy of UT-15 in patients with severe symptomatic primary pulmonary hypertension.", "detailed_description": "PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to center and etiology of disease. Patients receive conventional oral therapy plus a continuous subcutaneous infusion of either UT-15 or placebo for 12 weeks. After completing 12 weeks of treatment, patients may continue therapy with open label UT-15. Patients who received placebo cross over to receive UT-15.
