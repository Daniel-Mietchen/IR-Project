{"brief_title": "Epidemiology of Impaired Coagulant Balance in Diabetes", "brief_summary": "To determine the nature, extent and molecular mechanisms responsible for impaired fibrinolysis in White, Black, Hispanic and American Indian populations with respect to the presence or absence of diabetes. The overall objective is to determine whether impairments of fibrinolysis underlie subclinical and clinical vascular disease in diabetes in specific populations with and without accelerated microvascular disease.", "detailed_description": "BACKGROUND: The results of this project should clarify the extent to which results obtained in experimental animals pertain directly to diabetes in human subjects. The study will also assist in the interpretation of results from clinical studies and from platelet activation experiments. The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the \"End Date\" entered in the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.", "condition": ["Cardiovascular Diseases", "Heart Diseases", "Diabetes Mellitus", "Blood Coagulation Disorders"], "criteria": "No eligibility criteria", "gender": "Male", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "100 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "mesh_term": ["Diabetes Mellitus", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Heart Diseases", "Blood Coagulation Disorders", "Hemostatic Disorders"], "id": "NCT00005481"}
