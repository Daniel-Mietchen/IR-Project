{"brief_title": "Psychosocial Treatment for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Type I", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to develop and implement a treatment that focuses on behaviors to reduce symptom severity and functional impairment in patients with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Predominantly Inattentive Type (ADHD-I). The long-term goal of this study is to apply the treatment to larger-scale trials to determine its effectiveness and generalizability.", "detailed_description": "ADHD-I is a highly prevalent and serious childhood disorder that affects academic and social development. The symptoms of ADHD-I differ from those of the well-studied ADHD Combined Type. Unfortunately, studies of psychosocial interventions for ADHD-I are currently unavailable. Effective treatments for ADHD-I are still needed. Participants are randomly assigned to receive either a behavioral intervention or treatment as usual for 10 to 12 weeks. The behavioral intervention includes parent and child skill development groups, family meetings, and consultation with the child's teacher to address attention problems and areas of impairment at home and school. Parent and child interviews, teacher and child ratings, and psychoeducational testing are used to assess participants. Participants are assessed post-treatment and at a 2-month follow-up visit.", "condition": ["Attention Deficit Disorder With Hyperactivity"], "intervention_type": ["Behavioral"], "intervention_name": ["Psychosocial (behavioral) Intervention"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - ADHD, Predominantly Inattentive Type - Public or private school attendance - English speaking", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "7 Years", "maximum_age": "11 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "mesh_term": ["Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity", "Hyperkinesis"], "id": "NCT00071656"}
