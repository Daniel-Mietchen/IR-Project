{"brief_title": "hOKT3gamma1 (Ala-Ala) for the Prevention of Human Islet Allograft Failure", "brief_summary": "The broad, long-term goal of this proposal is to improve the results and applicability of islet allotransplantation early in the course of type 1 diabetes through the administration of selective and short-term immunotherapy. More specifically, the objectives of these studies is to conduct an open-labeled, one-year follow-up Phase I/II study in patients with surgical and type 1 diabetes to determine the safety, tolerability, immune activity, and pharmacokinetics of hOKT3gamma1 (Ala-ala) administration for the prevention of autoimmune destruction and rejection of allogeneic islet transplants.", "detailed_description": "Adverse events will be monitored and recorded throughout the first year post-transplant. The proportion of surgical and type 1 diabetic subjects receiving an islet allotransplant who achieve and maintain full or partial islet graft function during the first year post-transplant will be determined to assess the efficacy of hOKT3gamma1 (Ala-ala) administration. Successful completion of the proposed clinical trial will increase our understanding of the safety, efficacy and underlying mechanisms of selective immunotherapy with the anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody hOKT3gamma1 (Ala-ala) for the maximization of engraftment and functional survival of allogeneic human islets in surgical and type 1 diabetic recipients.", "condition": "Islets of Langerhans Transplantation", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "hOKT3gamma1 (Ala-ala)", "criteria": "Inclusion: - Primary islet allotransplant - surgical or type 1 diabetes mellitus, complicated by signs and symptoms that persist despite intensive efforts made in close cooperation with their diabetes care team - Age 18 or older - must give written informed consent", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "60 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00008801.xml"}
