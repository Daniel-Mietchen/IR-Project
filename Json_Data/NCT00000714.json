{"brief_title": "An Open, Prospective, Multicenter Study of Trimetrexate With Leucovorin Rescue for AIDS Patients With Pneumocystis Carinii Pneumonia (PCP) and Serious Intolerance to Approved Therapies", "brief_summary": "To determine the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug therapy (trimetrexate plus leucovorin calcium (TMTX / LCV)) in the treatment of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) in patients who have AIDS, are HIV positive, or are at high risk for HIV infection, and who have suffered severe or life-threatening ill effects from both conventional therapies for PCP. AMENDED: 08/01/90 As of August 31, 1989, 437 patients were enrolled into uncontrolled studies of trimetrexate for PCP:214 in TX 301/ACTG 0=039 (trimetrexate for patients intolerant of approved therapies) and 223 in NS 401 (trimetrexate for patients refractory to approved therapies). The analysis of overall response rate, stringently defined as having received at least 14 days of trimetrexate and being alive at follow-up 1 month after the completion of therapy, reveals 84/159 intolerant patients and 48/160 refractory patients had responded, for rates of 53 percent and 30 percent, respectively. These response rates include all individuals who received at least one dose of trimetrexate. Of the 111 patients who were ventilator-dependent at study entry, 18 completed a course of therapy and were alive a month later, for a response rate of 16 percent. All other ventilated patients died. The most common severe (grades 3 and 4) toxicities were: transaminase elevation (> 5 x normal) in 94 patients, anemia (< 7.9 g/dl) in 109, neutropenia (< 750 cells/mm3) in 58, fever (> 40 C) in 37, and thrombocytopenia (< 50000 platelets/mm3) in 27. Toxicity required discontinuation of therapy in approximately 5 percent of all patients. Original design: The drugs usually used to treat PCP in AIDS patients, trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole and pentamidine, have had to be discontinued in many patients because of severe side effects. Currently there are no proven alternatives to these drugs. TMTX was chosen for this trial because it was found to be very active against the PCP organism in laboratory tests. Also TMTX, in combination with LCV, had a high response rate and did not cause severe toxicity in a preliminary trial.", "detailed_description": "AMENDED: 08/01/90 As of August 31, 1989, 437 patients were enrolled into uncontrolled studies of trimetrexate for PCP:214 in TX 301/ACTG 0=039 (trimetrexate for patients intolerant of approved therapies) and 223 in NS 401 (trimetrexate for patients refractory to approved therapies).

Also TMTX, in combination with LCV, had a high response rate and did not cause severe toxicity in a preliminary trial. Patients entered in the study are given TMTX for 21 days and LCV for 24 days. Doses are determined by body size. Both drugs are given by intravenous infusion, but LCV may be given orally after the first 10 days. It is essential to ensure that patients receive each and every dose of LCV and that LCV therapy is continued for a full 3 days after TMTX therapy has been completed or discontinued. Doses are adjusted if side effects, such as low white blood cell counts, are too severe. During the 21-day trial, zidovudine (AZT) may not be used, because of possible increased bone marrow toxicity. AZT may be resumed as soon as the administration of TMTX and LCV has been completed.", "condition": ["Pneumonia, Pneumocystis Carinii", "HIV Infections"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Trimetrexate glucuronate", "Leucovorin calcium"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria Concurrent Medication: Allowed: - Noninvestigational therapies as needed. - Maintenance therapy with investigational triazoles such as itraconazole and SCH 39304. - High-dose corticosteroids (exceed physiologic replacement doses) including oral prednisone 40 mg bid for 5 days, 40 mg daily for 5 days and then 20 mg daily for the remainder of PCP therapy.
