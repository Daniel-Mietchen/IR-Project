{"brief_title": "Quality of Life in Patients Undergoing Surgery or Brachytherapy for Stage II Prostate Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Quality of life assessment in patients undergoing prostate cancer treatment may help determine the intermediate-term and long-term effects of surgery and brachytherapy. PURPOSE: Randomized clinical trial to study quality of life in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy or brachytherapy for stage II prostate cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Compare changes in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with stage II prostate cancer up to 2 years after treatment with radical prostatectomy or brachytherapy. - Compare the effect of baseline HRQOL, age, and other covariates on HRQOL improvement or deterioration in these patients up to 10 years after these treatments. - Compare the effect of treatment modality on HRQOL improvement or deterioration in these patients up to 10 years after these treatments. - Compare the effects of treatment failure on HRQOL, in terms of disease progression, in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms on ACOSOG-Z0070 (radical prostatectomy vs brachytherapy). Patients in both arms complete a quality of life questionnaire at baseline, 2 and 6 months after treatment, and then at 1, 2, 4, 7, and 10 years after treatment. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 500 patients (250 per group) will be accrued for this study within 2 years.", "condition": ["Prostate Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Procedure"], "intervention_name": ["quality-of-life assessment"], "arm_group_label": ["Quality of life questionnaire"], "study_pop": "\n      ", "sampling_method": "Non-Probability Sample", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate within the past 120 days - Stage II disease (T1c-T2a, N0, M0) - Concurrent enrollment on ACOSOG-Z0070 - Not yet randomized to an intervention arm (radical prostatectomy or brachytherapy) - Willing and able to complete heath-related quality of life questionnaires PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - 75 and under PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Endocrine therapy - More than 6 months since prior hormonal therapy for prostate cancer", "gender": "Male", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "75 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "adenocarcinoma of the prostate", "mesh_term": ["Prostatic Neoplasms"], "id": "NCT00052481"}
