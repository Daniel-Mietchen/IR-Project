{"brief_title": "Irbesartan/Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) Combination Therapy as First Line Treatment for Severe Hypertension", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this clinical research is to learn if severe hypertension can be better controlled by initially treating with a combination of drugs (Irbesartan/HCTZ), in patients who are unlikely to achieve blood pressure (B/P) control with only one drug. In addition, the study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of the drugs.", "condition": ["Hypertension"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Irbesartan/HCTZ", "Irbesartan monotherapy"], "description": ["Tablets, Oral, Irbesartan 150mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg, Once daily, 7 weeks.", "Tablets, Oral, 150 mg, Once daily, 7 weeks."], "arm_group_label": ["A1", "A2"], "other_name": ["Avapro", "Avapro"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Men and women ages 18 and older; - Willing to provide written informed consent; - Must have uncontrolled hypertension defined as: currently untreated with a diastolic blood pressure greater than 110 mmHg OR currently receiving antihypertensive monotherapy with a diastolic blood pressure greater than 100 mmHg.
