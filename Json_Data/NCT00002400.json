{"brief_title": "A Study of Two Anti-HIV Drug Combinations in HIV-Infected Patients", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of giving HIV-infected patients delavirdine (DLV) plus zidovudine (ZDV) plus 2 doses of indinavir (IDV) or ZDV plus IDV plus lamivudine (3TC). This study also examines how the body processes DLV when it is given in combination with other drugs.", "detailed_description": "In this multicenter, open-label study, 45 HIV-1-positive patients receive either combination drug therapy with delavirdine (DLV), zidovudine (ZDV), and indinavir (IDV) or combination drug therapy with ZDV, lamivudine (3TC), and IDV. NOTE: Patients are treated for 24 weeks and may opt to continue on study for 24 additional weeks, if HIV-1 RNA is less than 5,000 copies/ml or at the investigator's discretion.", "condition": "HIV Infections", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Zidovudine", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria Patients must have: - HIV-1 positive. - CD4 count above 50. - HIV-1 RNA greater than 20,000.
