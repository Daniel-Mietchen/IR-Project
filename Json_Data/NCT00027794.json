{"brief_title": "Radical Prostatectomy in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Radical prostatectomy may be an effective treatment for locally advanced prostate cancer. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of radical prostatectomy in treating patients who have locally advanced prostate cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the success rate of radical prostatectomy in patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the prostate. - Determine the serious toxic event rate of this surgery in these patients. - Determine the pN status of patients treated with this surgery. - Determine the percentage of patients found to have organ-confined tumors (pT2) after undergoing this surgery. - Determine the 2-year prostate-specific antigen-free survival rate of patients treated with this surgery. - Determine the surgical morbidity rates of patients treated with this surgery. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients undergo limited pelvic lymphadenectomy and then radical retropubic prostatectomy. Patients who are found to have pN-positive disease receive further treatment according to the investigator's discretion. Patients with pN0 disease are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 4 months for 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 32-74 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Prostate Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Procedure"], "intervention_name": ["conventional surgery"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate - Unilateral cT3a, cN0, M0 - Well or moderately differentiated tumor - Gleason score no greater than 7 (4 plus 3 or 3 plus 4) - Total serum prostate-specific antigen no greater than 20 ng/mL (Hybritech equivalent) PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 70 and under Performance status: - WHO 0-1 Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - WBC greater than 3,000/mm^3 - Platelet count greater than 100,000/mm^3 - Hemoglobin greater than 9 g/dL Hepatic: - Bilirubin no greater than 1.5 times normal - ALT or AST less than 3 times normal - PT and PTT normal Renal: - Creatinine no greater than 1.5 mg/dL Cardiovascular: - No preexisting uncontrolled cardiac disease, signs of cardiac failure, or rhythm disturbances requiring therapy - No myocardial infarction within the past 6 months Pulmonary: - No gross abnormalities on chest x-ray Other: - No other disease that would preclude surgery - No other prior malignancy except adequately treated basal cell skin cancer - No other concurrent primary malignancy - No psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical condition that would preclude compliance PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - Not specified Chemotherapy: - Not specified Endocrine therapy: - No prior hormonal therapy that would affect assessment of clinical T staging, margin positivity, or definitive pT staging Radiotherapy: - No prior pelvic radiotherapy that would affect surgical resectability and perioperative morbidity Surgery: - No prior surgery in the small pelvis (vascular surgery, mesh graft hernia repair, any surgery for benign prostatic hypertrophy, or transurethral resection of prostate) that would preclude prostatectomy", "gender": "Male", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "70 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "stage III prostate cancer", "mesh_term": ["Prostatic Neoplasms"], "id": "NCT00027794"}
