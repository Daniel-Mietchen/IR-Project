OUTLINE: Caregivers (CG) complete written questionnaires assessing demographics, positive and negative affect, dispositional inhibition, marital satisfaction, and physical health over 45 minutes to 1 hour on day 1. CG then engage in two oral emotional expression exercises (on the topic of caregiving and the transplant) over 2 hours on day 2. Patients are present for one oral emotional expression exercise. Participants are followed at 2 weeks and 6 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patient/spouse couples will be accrued for this study within 18 months.", "condition": "Testicular Germ Cell Tumor", "intervention_type": "Procedure", "intervention_name": "psychosocial assessment and care", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - In a marriage OR long-term, committed, heterosexual or homosexual, cohabiting relationship in which one member is post-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation - Patients must meet the following criteria: - At least 1 year since prior first bone marrow, stem cell, or umbilical cord blood transplantation - Allogeneic or autologous - Diagnosis of malignancy, myelodysplasia, or non-malignancy - No indication of possible or confirmed relapse - Spouse/caregiver (CG) must meet the following criteria: - Serve as the primary CG to the patient - No prior or concurrent neurologic disorder PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - 21 and over Performance status - Not specified Life expectancy - Not specified Hematopoietic - Not specified Hepatic - Not specified Renal - Not specified Other - No concurrent major psychiatric disorder - English-speaking PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - See Disease Characteristics Chemotherapy - Not specified Endocrine therapy - Not specified Radiotherapy - Not specified Surgery - Not specified", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "21 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00082654.xml"}
