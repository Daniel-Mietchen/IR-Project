To evaluate the safety and efficacy of depsipeptide in patients with refractory or relapsed multiple myeloma (MM). OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive FR901228 (depsipeptide) IV over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a stable plateau (stable paraprotein levels or urine protein excretion over 3 consecutive determinations at least 4 weeks apart) may receive maintenance therapy comprising FR901228 IV on days 1 and 15, with courses repeating every 28 days. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 5-12.5 months.", "condition": ["DS Stage II Plasma Cell Myeloma", "DS Stage III Plasma Cell Myeloma", "Refractory Plasma Cell Myeloma"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Other"], "intervention_name": ["Romidepsin", "Laboratory Biomarker Analysis"], "description": ["Given IV", "Correlative studies"], "arm_group_label": ["Treatment (romidepsin)", "Treatment (romidepsin)"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IIa or IIIa multiple myeloma - Patient has progressive disease and has had 1, 2, 3, or 4 prior lines of therapy - Bilirubin < 2.0 mg/dL - SGOT/SGPT =< 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal - Serum creatinine =< 1.5 mg/dl OR creatinine clearance >= 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal - Karnofsky Performance Status equal or greater than 70%; KPS 60% will be allowed if reduced KPS is due to advanced skeletal disease - Measurable disease as defined by serum M protein >= 1.0 gm/dl measured by serum protein electrophoresis or free light chain measurement, or quantitative immunoglobulins and/or urinary M protein excretion >= 200 mg/24 hrs - Ejection fraction >= 50% and normal baseline EKG tracing - No known central nervous system abnormality including neoplastic, vascular, inflammatory, degenerative or epilepsy - Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks - Leukocytes >= 3,000/uL - Absolute neutrophil count >= 1,500/uL - Platelets >= 100,000/uL - Patients in whom cytopenias are considered to be due to myeloma marrow infiltration will be allowed as long as they meet the following criteria: - Bone marrow biopsy displaying >= normal cellularity for age and >= 50% involvement by myeloma - ANC > 1,000 and platelets > 50,000 - Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately - Ability to understand and the willingness to sign written informed consent Exclusion Criteria: - Administration of chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to enrollment or unresolved adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier - Prior treatment with a histone deacetylase inhibitor - Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agent - History of second cancer (except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other cancer for which the patient has been disease free >= 5 years) - Non secretory disease or plasma cell leukemia (> 2000 circulating plasma cells/uL) - History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to depsipeptide - Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements - Patients with left ventricular hypertrophy or history of arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure; patients may not be taking hydrochlorothiazides - Patients that are pregnant or lactating will be excluded from this trial - Known HIV positivity; patients infected with the HIV virus will be excluded from this trial", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "mesh_term": ["Multiple Myeloma", "Neoplasms, Plasma Cell", "Romidepsin"], "id": "NCT00066638"}
