{"brief_title": "Study of Heat Shock Protein-Peptide Complex (HSPPC-96) Versus IL-2/DTIC for Stage IV Melanoma", "brief_summary": "The primary goal of this study is to determine if people with metastatic melanoma who receive Heat Shock Protein-Peptide Complex - 96 (HSPPC-96 or Oncophage) after surgery live longer than people who may or may not have surgery but who receive conventional chemotherapy including IL-2/DTIC. A second goal is to determine the safety and frequency of side effects in subjects who receive therapy with HSPPC-96.", "detailed_description": "Primary Objective: - To determine whether subjects with stage IV melanoma randomized to HSPPC-96 have longer survival than subjects randomized to physician's choice including interleukin-2 and/or dacarbazine/temozolomide and/or complete tumor resection. Secondary Objective: - To determine frequency of adverse events in subjects randomized to HSPPC-96.", "condition": ["Malignant Melanoma"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["HSPPC-96 or Oncophage"], "criteria": "Eligibility Assessment: (The following assessments must be obtained within three weeks prior to randomization into the study) - Medical history and physical examination (including EGOG score, evidence of immunosuppression); - CT/MRI of the chest, abdomen and pelvis; - Clinical examination; - CT/MRI of the brain; - Complete Blood Count with differential including platelets; - Electrolytes (Na, Cl, K, HCO3, Ca, Mg, PO4); - Renal function tests (BUN and creatinine); - Liver function tests (bilirubin, AST, ALT); - Serum pregnancy test for all women of childbearing potential. Inclusion Criteria: - Stage IV Melanoma (AJCC); - No prior therapy for stage IV melanoma; - No prior therapy with interleukin-2 and/or dacarbazine/temozolomide within the past 12 months prior to study entry; - Candidate for surgical resection of some/all sites of melanoma and expected to obtain greater tan or equal to 7 grams of viable cancer tissue (in aggregate), which is equivalent to a greater than or equal to 2 cm lesion on CT/MRI or clinical examination; - No brain metastases; - ECOG score 0 or 1; - Adequate cardiac function; - Adequate hematopoietic, liver and renal function; - Female subjects of child-bearing potential must agree to use contraception during the study - Signed written informed consent. Exclusion Criteria: - Mucosal or ocular melanomas; - Other malignancies treated within the last five years, except in situ cervix carcinoma or non-melanoma skin cancer; - Primary or secondary immunodeficiency, in the opinion of the investigator (including immunosuppressive disease, or use of systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications); - Prior splenectomy; - Uncontrolled infection or other serious medical illnesses; - Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding; - Subjects participating in any other studies requiring administration of an investigational drug/biologic agent.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "Immunotherapy, Cancer, Melanoma, Skin Cancer, tumor", "mesh_term": ["Melanoma"], "id": "NCT00039000"}
