{"brief_title": "Combination Chemotherapy Plus Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus radiation therapy in treating patients who have locally advanced pancreatic cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of gemcitabine, cisplatin, and radiotherapy, in terms of 1-year survival, in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily five days a week for 5.5 weeks. Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes followed by cisplatin IV over 1 hour twice a week for the first 3 weeks of radiotherapy. Beginning 4 weeks after the completion of radiotherapy, patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for a total of 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at completion of radiotherapy, at completion of chemotherapy, and 3 months after completion of therapy. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-47 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-28 months.", "condition": ["Pancreatic Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Radiation"], "intervention_name": ["cisplatin", "gemcitabine hydrochloride", "radiation therapy"], "arm_group_label": ["radiotherapy + gemcitabine + cisplatin", "radiotherapy + gemcitabine + cisplatin", "radiotherapy + gemcitabine + cisplatin"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed unresectable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas - No cystadenocarcinoma of the pancreas or pancreatic tumors of neuroendocrine origin - Prior subtotal resection or gross residual disease - No microscopic residual disease only - No metastatic disease outside of planned study radiotherapy field PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 and over Performance status: - ECOG 0-1 Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - Absolute neutrophil count at least 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 100,000/mm^3 Hepatic: - Bilirubin no greater than 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) - AST no greater than 3 times ULN Renal: - Creatinine no greater than 1.5 times ULN Other: - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception - Able to maintain adequate oral nutrition - No significant infection - No other medical condition that would preclude study - No other malignancy within the past 5 years except non-melanoma skin cancer - No significant nausea or vomiting PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - No prior or concurrent biologic therapy Chemotherapy: - No prior chemotherapy - No other concurrent chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: - Not specified Radiotherapy: - See Disease Characteristics - No prior radiotherapy that would overlap planned study radiotherapy fields Surgery: - See Disease Characteristics - At least 21 days since prior laparotomy", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "120 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "stage IV pancreatic cancer", "mesh_term": ["Pancreatic Neoplasms", "Gemcitabine", "Cisplatin"], "id": "NCT00026403"}
