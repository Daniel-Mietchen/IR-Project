{"brief_title": "Evaluating the Use of SR34006 Compared to Warfarin or Acenocoumarol in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation (AMADEUS)", "brief_summary": "This trial will include patients who have a heart condition called atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is an abnormal rhythm (irregular beat) in the heart. Patients with atrial fibrillation have an increased chance for a blood clot to form in the heart and move to other blood vessels in the body and cause obstruction. This obstruction may damage tissue. For example, a blood clot plugging a vessel in the brain could cause a stroke. Therefore, patients with atrial fibrillation may be given anticoagulant (blood-thinning) tablets such as warfarin or acenocoumarol. The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of a new injectable anticoagulant drug that is administered once weekly, SR34006 with warfarin or acenocoumarol tablets. Assignment to either SR34006 Injection or vitamin K antagonist (warfarin or acenocoumarol) tablets will be purely by chance and will be known by both patients and their doctors.", "condition": "Atrial Fibrillation", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "vitamin K antagonist (warfarin or acenocoumarol) tablets", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - ECG-documented atrial fibrillation (AF) and an indication for long-term vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy based on the presence of at least one of the following risk factors: 1. previous ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA) or systemic embolism 2. hypertension requiring drug treatment 3. left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction <45% or symptomatic congestive heart failure) 4. age >75 years 5. age between 65-75 years plus diabetes mellitus, or 6. age between 65-75 years plus symptomatic coronary artery disease (previous myocardial infarction (MI) or angina pectoris) - Written informed consent Exclusion Criteria: - Legal lower age limitations (country specific) - Indication for VKA other than AF, including prosthetic heart valves, venous thromboembolism, and planned cardioversion - Transient AF caused by a reversible disorder - Active bleeding or high risk of bleeding - Recent (<15 days) or anticipated invasive procedures with potential for uncontrolled bleeding, including major surgery - Participation in another pharmacotherapeutic study within the prior 30 days - Creatinine clearance <10 mL/min, severe hepatic disease, or bacterial endocarditis - Uncontrolled hypertension: systolic blood pressure > 180 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure > 110 mm Hg - Pregnancy or childbearing potential without proper contraceptive measures - Breastfeeding - Any other contraindication listed in the labeling of warfarin or acenocoumarol", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00070655.xml"}
