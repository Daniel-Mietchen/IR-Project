{"brief_title": "Phase I Pilot Study of Gene Therapy for Cystic Fibrosis Using Cationic Liposome Mediated Gene Transfer", "brief_summary": "OBJECTIVES: Determine whether copies of the cystic fibrosis gene (pGT-1) can be delivered to the cells lining the nose of cystic fibrosis patients using cationic liposome (DMRIE/DOPE) mediated gene transfer.", "detailed_description": "PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Under direct visualization, patients receive lipid/DNA formulation (pGT-1 lipid complex) by syringe instillation over 30 minutes to the right inferior nasal turbinate. Patients are followed daily for 7 days, twice a week for 3 weeks, every 2-3 weeks for 10 weeks, then every 3 months thereafter.", "condition": "Cystic Fibrosis", "intervention_type": "Genetic", "intervention_name": "pGT-1 gene lipid complex", "criteria": "- Cystic fibrosis patients - Not pregnant Fertile patients must use effective contraception", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "16 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00004471.xml"}
