{"brief_title": "Randomized Amifostine For SCCHN", "brief_summary": "This research study is studying a drug called Amifostine as a treatment for squamous cell carcinoma in the head and/or neck area.", "detailed_description": "Amifostine is a drug that is used to treat moderate to severe xerostomia (dry mouth) for those who receive radiation therapy for head and neck cancer. It was approved by the FDA for use intravenously. This study plans to examine the effects of xerostomia when Amifostine is used subcutaneously (by injection). Amifostine has been seen to be effective when used to combat the effects of dry mouth, but also has some side effects which are listed later in this consent form. The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of twice a day radiation therapy given with chemotherapy consisting of carboplatin and paclitaxel (Taxo 1). This study will examine the effectiveness of adding Amifostine in the hopes of reducing the side effects of radiation.", "condition": "Xerostomia", "intervention_type": "Radiation", "intervention_name": "radiation", "description": "Given once daily for 4 weeks and then twice daily for 2 weeks.", "arm_group_label": "Arm B No-Amifostine", "other_name": "Onxal", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria - Histologically or cytologically proven squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.
