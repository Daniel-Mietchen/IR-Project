{"brief_title": "Paclitaxel and ABI-007 in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and ABI-007, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining paclitaxel with ABI-007 may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Randomized phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining paclitaxel with ABI-007 in treating patients who have locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine whether a change in the formulation alters the pharmacokinetic profile of paclitaxel in the plasma of patients with incurable locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors treated with ABI-007 and paclitaxel. Secondary - Correlate pharmacokinetic data of this regimen with decrease in the neutrophil count at nadir in these patients. - Determine the intra- and interindividual pharmacokinetic variability of ABI-007 in these patients. - Determine protein binding of paclitaxel via measurement of \u03b1-1-acid glycoprotein and serum albumin levels in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, pilot study. - Courses 1 and 2: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1 and ABI-007 IV over 30 minutes on day 22. - Arm II: Patients receive ABI-007 IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 22. - Courses 3 and beyond: All patients receive ABI-007 IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["paclitaxel", "paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed malignant solid tumor - Considered incurable - Locally advanced or metastatic disease - Likely to be responsive to taxane-based therapy - Patients who are refractory to prior paclitaxel are ineligible - No symptomatic or untreated brain metastasis or carcinomatous meningitis - No patients who are unable to remain free of corticosteroid therapy for > 4 weeks due to CNS disease - No previously untreated locally advanced breast cancer - No hematologic malignancy PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - 18 and over Performance status - ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy - At least 3 months Hematopoietic - Granulocyte count \u2265 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count \u2265 100,000/mm^3 Hepatic - Bilirubin normal - ALT and AST \u2264 1.5 times upper limit of normal Renal - Creatinine normal OR - Creatinine clearance \u2265 60 mL/min Cardiovascular - LVEF \u2265 40% - No clinical signs or symptoms of heart failure - No symptomatic congestive heart failure - No unstable angina pectoris Other - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception during and for 2 months after study participation - No history of allergic reaction attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to paclitaxel (e.g., docetaxel, Cremophor^\u00ae EL [CrEL], polysorbate 80 [Tween 80], or CrEL-containing medications [e.g., cyclosporine]) - No history of seizure disorder requiring anticonvulsant therapy - No active serious infection - No psychiatric illness or social situation that would preclude study compliance - No other uncontrolled illness PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - No concurrent immunotherapy - No concurrent filgrastim (G-CSF) during courses 1 and 2 Chemotherapy - See Disease Characteristics - At least 3 weeks since prior chemotherapy (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin) - No other concurrent chemotherapy Endocrine therapy - See Disease Characteristics - At least 2 weeks since prior hormonal therapy - Concurrent luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists for prostate cancer allowed Radiotherapy - At least 3 weeks since prior radiotherapy - No concurrent radiotherapy Surgery - Not specified Other - More than 2 weeks since prior drugs, herbal preparations, or dietary supplements known to influence CYP3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, rifampin, Hypericum perforatum [St. John's wort], garlic supplements, or grapefruit juice) and/or CYP2C8 - No concurrent substances known or likely to interfere with the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel (e.g., verapamil or cyclosporine) - No other concurrent investigational agents - No other concurrent anticancer therapy", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "unspecified adult solid tumor, protocol specific", "mesh_term": ["Paclitaxel", "Albumin-Bound Paclitaxel"], "id": "NCT00095914"}
