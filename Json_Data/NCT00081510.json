Secondary Objective(s): - To determine the effects of anastrozole in combination with lonafarnib on objective response, duration of response, overall survival, and safety in subjects with advanced breast cancer. To assess the exposure and pharmacokinetics of lonafarnib and anastrozole in the subject population.", "condition": "Breast Cancer", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "anastrozole", "arm_group_label": "Placebo plus Anastrozole", "other_name": "SCH 66336", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Postmenopausal women who have histologically-confirmed breast cancer with the following characteristics: - estrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive, - locally advanced disease - distant metastatic disease, stage 4 - Subjects eligible for single-agent treatment with aromatase inhibitors for current disease. - Subjects taking biophosphonates are allowed if they begin bisphosphonate therapy AT LEAST two weeks prior to randomization. - Measurable disease (masses with clearly defined margins on radiological images and at least one diameter >=20 mm[>=10 mm if spiral CT]) or evaluable disease (masses with margins not clearly defined on radiological images or with no diameter >= 20 mm).
