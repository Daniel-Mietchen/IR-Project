{"brief_title": "The Safety and Effectiveness of SPC3 in HIV-1 Infected Patients", "brief_summary": "To assess the effects of two doses of synthetic peptide construction 3 ( SPC3 ) on HIV-1 plasma levels (as measured by RNA PCR Amplicor) and on lymphocyte subsets in patients with initial viral load above 10,000 copies/ml. To study the safety of SPC3 and the kinetics of HIV-1 plasma level changes.", "detailed_description": "The first five patients receive SPC3 daily for 3 weeks. If that dose is tolerated, the dose is increased and given to the next 5 patients for 3 weeks. The remaining ten patients receive a dose of SPC3 based on response to the previous two dose levels. Patients are followed through day 28.", "condition": ["HIV Infections"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Peptide Construction 3, Synthetic"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria Concurrent Medication: Allowed: - Antiretrovirals provided regimen has been stable for at least 6 weeks prior to study screening.
