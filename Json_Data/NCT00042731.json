{"brief_title": "Isoflavones & Lycopene in Localized Prostate Ca:Prior to Radical Prostatectomy", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Eating a diet rich in isoflavones, compounds found in soy foods, or lycopene, a substance found in tomatoes, may keep prostate cancer from growing. Giving isoflavones or lycopene before surgery may be an effective treatment for prostate cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of isoflavones with that of lycopene before surgery in treating patients who have stage I or stage II prostate cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Compare the effect of isoflavones vs lycopene prior to radical prostatectomy on intermediate biomarkers (e.g., indices of cell proliferation and apoptosis) in patients with localized prostate cancer. - Compare the effects of these nutritional supplements on increases in plasma levels and tissue levels of these agents in these patients. - Compare the effects of these nutritional supplements on changes in surrogate markers of disease progression (e.g., prostate-specific antigen levels) in these patients. - Compare the effects of these nutritional supplements on changes in serum steroid hormones, estradiol, and free testosterone in these patients. - Compare the magnitude of these changes in patients treated with these nutritional supplements vs patients in the control group. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease stage (stage I vs stage II) and presence of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. Patients are randomized to 1 of 7 treatment groups. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 87 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.", "condition": ["Prostate Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Dietary Supplement", "Dietary Supplement", "Dietary Supplement"], "intervention_name": ["Lycopene", "Multivitamin", "Soy isoflavones"], "description": ["Daily administration as outlined in treatment arm(s)", "Daily administration as outlined in treatment arm(s)", "Daily administration as outlined in treatment arm(s)"], "arm_group_label": ["Oral lycopene with multivitamin", "Oral isoflavones with multivitamin", "Oral lycopene with multivitamin", "Multiple vitamin alone", "Oral isoflavones with multivitamin"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed localized prostate cancer - Stage I or II - Scheduled prostatectomy between 4-6 weeks after initial biopsy PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 45 to 80 Performance status: - Not specified Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - Not specified Hepatic: - No known history of hepatic disease Renal: - No known history of renal disease Other: - No known history of thyroid disease - Body mass index no greater than 32 - Omnivorous diet - No known allergy to study supplements - No evidence of prostatitis or urinary tract infection - No other prior malignancy except nonmelanoma skin cancer - Fertile patients must use effective contraception PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - Not specified Chemotherapy: - Not specified Endocrine therapy: - No concurrent thyroid hormone replacement medications Radiotherapy: - Not specified Surgery: - See Disease Characteristics Other: - At least 30 days since prior antibiotics - At least 30 days since prior diet high in soy and/or lycopene products (e.g., greater than 40 mg soy/day and/or greater than 15 mg lycopene/day) - No other concurrent nutritional supplements, including modular supplements with other carotenoids and isoflavones - No prior or concurrent therapy for prostate cancer", "gender": "Male", "minimum_age": "45 Years", "maximum_age": "80 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "stage IIA prostate cancer", "mesh_term": ["Prostatic Neoplasms", "Lycopene", "Carotenoids"], "id": "NCT00042731"}
