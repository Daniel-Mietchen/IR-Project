{"brief_title": "Evaluation of the Effect on Glucose Control and the Safety and Tolerability of AC2993 in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus", "brief_summary": "This is a multicenter, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, short-term, dose-response study to examine the effects on glucose control of AC2993 as compared to placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients will be individuals with type 2 diabetes treated with metformin for at least 3 months prior to screening.
