{"brief_title": "Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia: Calcium Channels as Therapeutic Targets", "brief_summary": "This study will test the ability of extended release nifedipine (Procardia XL), a blood pressure medication, to permit a decrease in the dose of glucocorticoid medication children take to treat congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH).", "detailed_description": "This protocol is designed to assess both acute and chronic effects of the calcium channel antagonist, nifedipine, on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia. The multicenter trial is composed of two phases and will involve a double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel design. The goal of Phase I is to examine the ability of nifedipine vs. placebo to decrease adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels, as well as to begin to assess the dose-dependency of nifedipine effects. The goal of Phase II is to evaluate the long-term effects of nifedipine; that is, can attenuation of ACTH release by nifedipine permit a decrease in the dosage of glucocorticoid needed to suppress the HPA axis? Such a decrease would, in turn, reduce the deleterious effects of glucocorticoid treatment in CAH.", "condition": "Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Nifedipine", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - diagnosed with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) - normal ECG during baseline evaluation Exclusion Criteria: - history of liver disease, or elevated liver function tests - history of cardiovascular disease", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "14 Years", "maximum_age": "35 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00000102.xml"}
