{"brief_title": "Anti-Leukemic Dendritic Cell Activated Donor Lymphocytes", "brief_summary": "Objectives: 1. Determine the toxicity of infusions of allogeneic donor lymphocytes activated by acute leukemia derived dendritic cells (DC/ADL) in relapsed patients after allo-stem cell transplants. 2. Quantitate the alloreactivity of DC/ADL and circulating immune effector cells in patients after infusion. 3. Assess efficacy of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia in Blastic Crisis (CML-BC) derived dendritic cells and activated lymphocytes in promoting and sustaining remission in patients with relapse after allo-BMT or stem cell transplant.", "condition": ["Leukemia, Myelocytic, Acute"], "intervention_type": ["Procedure", "Biological"], "intervention_name": ["Apheresis", "Stem Cell Transplant"], "description": ["Apheresis for T-Cell collection", "Stem cell or marrow infusions of allogeneic donor lymphocytes activated by acute leukemia derived dendritic cells (DC/ADL)."], "arm_group_label": ["Apheresis + Transplant", "Apheresis + Transplant"], "other_name": ["SCT", "Stem Cell Transplantation"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - AML (any type except M3) or CIVIL in blast crisis with greater than or equal to 20% bone marrow blasts at the time of related donor marrow or stem cell transplantation or at relapse post transplant. - Willing to undergo a skin biopsy and either a leukodepletion apheresis or an additional marrow aspiration. - Stem cell or marrow donor willing to have apheresis for T-Cell collection. - Written voluntary informed consent must be obtained from patient and donor.
