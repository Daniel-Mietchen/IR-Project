{"brief_title": "Docetaxel and Cisplatin in Treating Patients With Untreated Stage IIIA Non-small Cell Lung Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of docetaxel and cisplatin in treating patients who have untreated stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Assess the therapeutic activity of docetaxel and cisplatin in patients with untreated stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer. - Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 and cisplatin IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 2. Treatment continues every 3 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-40 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": "Lung Cancer", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "docetaxel", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (T1-3, N2, M0) - Unresectable metastasis to ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes - Measurable disease - Must be at least 20 mm in one dimension by conventional techniques or at least 10 mm by spiral CT scan - No distant metastases - No CNS involvement - No pleural or pericardial effusion PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - Over 18 Performance status: - WHO 0-2 Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - Absolute neutrophil count at least 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 100,000/mm^3 Hepatic: - Bilirubin no greater than upper limit of normal (ULN) - AST/ALT no greater than 1.5 times ULN - Alkaline phosphatase no greater than 2.5 times ULN Renal: - Creatinine no greater than 1.25 ULN - Creatinine clearance at least 60 mL/min Cardiovascular: - No superior vena cava syndrome - No uncontrolled congestive heart failure or angina - No myocardial infarction within past year - No uncontrolled hypertension or arrhythmia Other: - Not pregnant or nursing - Fertile patients must use effective contraception - No concurrent active infection requiring IV antibiotic therapy - No other prior malignancy in past 5 years except carcinoma in situ of the cervix or adequately treated basal cell carcinoma, excluding melanoma, breast cancer, and hypernephroma - No concurrent illness or medical condition which is a contraindication for corticosteroid therapy (e.g., active ulcer, unstable diabetes mellitus) - No motor or sensory neurotoxicity of grade 2 or greater - No psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical condition that would preclude study PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - No concurrent immunotherapy Chemotherapy: - No prior chemotherapy for NSCLC - No other concurrent chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: - No concurrent hormonal therapy Radiotherapy: - No prior radiotherapy for NSCLC - No concurrent radiotherapy Surgery: - No prior surgery for NSCLC Other: - At least 1 month since prior investigational agents - No other concurrent experimental medications", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "19 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00005868.xml"}
