{"brief_title": "CORE: A Study of OPC-6535 With Asacol\u00ae in Maintaining Ulcerative Colitis (UC) Remission", "brief_summary": "This dose comparison study, taking place at over 200 sites worldwide, will compare the dosing, safety and efficacy of an investigational medicine OPC-6535 to the dosing, safety and efficacy of Asacol \u00ae in the maintenance of remission in subjects with ulcerative colitis.", "detailed_description": "Objective(s): This study will compare the safety and efficacy of 25 mg per day (QD) and 50 mg QD of OPC-6535 to 800 mg twice a day (BID) of Asacol\u00ae in the maintenance of remission in subjects with ulcerative colitis. Subject Population: - Subjects with ulcerative colitis currently in remission defined as rectal bleeding (RB) and flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) scores of 0, on or off a stable dose of sulfasalazine or 5-ASA products for at least 6 weeks. - Subjects must have had the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis established by prior colonoscopy or undergo colonoscopy in lieu of flexible sigmoidoscopy during the Screening Period. - Subjects must have had treatment for a flare of ulcerative colitis, with symptomatic onset of remission occurring no more than 52 weeks from the Screening Period. - Subjects may not have used corticosteroids, topical agents (corticosteroid or 5-ASA enemas, suppositories, foams), azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate within 6 weeks of the Screening Period. Upon entry, sulfasalazine and 5-ASA containing products will be discontinued. Safety: Vital signs, ECGs, laboratory studies (including hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis), and adverse events.", "condition": ["Ulcerative Colitis"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["OPC-6535", "Asacol\u00ae"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Male or female subjects, 18 to 80 years of age, inclusive. - Subjects with a prior diagnosis of ulcerative colitis, established by colonoscopy. - Subjects currently in remission. - Subjects who have undergone treatment for a flare of ulcerative colitis, with symptomatic onset of remission occurring no more than 52 weeks from the Screening Period. - If subjects are taking sulfasalazine or 5-ASA products prior to entry, the dose must be stable for at least 6 weeks prior to the Screening Period.
