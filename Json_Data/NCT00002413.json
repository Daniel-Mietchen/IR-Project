{"brief_title": "A Study of MKC-442 in HIV-Positive Patients", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to give MKC-442 plus at least two other anti-HIV drugs to patients who have never been treated with nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors but who have been treated with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors. This study also determines how long a drug combination including MKC-442 is effective.", "condition": "HIV Infections", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Emivirine", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria Concurrent Medication: Allowed: Based on medical history, medical condition, prior use of antiretroviral drugs, and genotypic analysis of the predominant strain of HIV-1 isolated from plasma, administration of at least 2 available antiviral agents by prescription may be given with MKC-422.
