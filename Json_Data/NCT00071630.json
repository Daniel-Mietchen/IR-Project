{"brief_title": "Therapeutic Processes and Treatment Outcome in Adolescents With Anxiety Disorders", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between different aspects of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and treatment outcome.", "detailed_description": "Anxiety disorders are common among children; if untreated, they can negatively affect children's lives. Evidence suggests that CBT can benefit children with anxiety disorders, but the causal mechanisms between therapy and beneficial outcomes have not been thoroughly investigated. Audio and videotaped sessions of children currently receiving CBT and those who received CBT in previous trials will be examined. Various rating scales will be used to rate therapeutic alliance, child involvement, and therapist flexibility for each session of CBT. To evaluate potential process variables that contribute to participant drop-out, this study will compare the early process variables for children who complete treatment and for those who discontinue treatment.", "condition": ["Anxiety Disorders"], "intervention_type": ["Behavioral"], "intervention_name": ["Cognitive Behavioral Therapy"], "criteria": "Inclusion criteria: - Diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or social phobia - At least one English-speaking parent Exclusion criteria: - IQ < 80 - Psychotic symptoms", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "8 Years", "maximum_age": "13 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "Adolescent", "mesh_term": ["Anxiety Disorders"], "id": "NCT00071630"}
