{"brief_title": "Antineoplaston Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Ovarian Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Antineoplastons are naturally-occurring substances that may also be made in the laboratory. Antineoplastons may inhibit the growth of cancer cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial studies the effectiveness of antineoplaston therapy in treating patients who have stage III or stage IV ovarian cancer", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Study the safety and possible effectiveness of antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 in patients with incurable stage III or IV ovarian cancer. - Describe response to, tolerance to, and side effects of this regimen in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients receive gradually escalating doses of antineoplaston A10 and antineoplaston AS2-1 by intravenous injection 6 times daily until the maximum tolerated dose level is reached. Treatment continues for at least 3 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients achieving complete response (CR) continue treatment for an additional 8 months after achieving CR. Tumors are measured every 2 months for 1 year and then every 3 months for 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Ovarian Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["antineoplaston A10", "antineoplaston AS2-1"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed stage III or IV epithelial or germ cell ovarian cancer that is unlikely to respond to existing therapy and for which no curative therapy exists - Measurable disease by CT scan or MRI PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 and over Performance status: - Karnofsky 60-100% Life expectancy: - At least 2 months Hematopoietic: - WBC at least 2,000/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 50,000/mm^3 Hepatic: - Bilirubin no greater than 2.5 mg/dL - SGOT/SGPT no greater than 5 times upper limit of normal - No hepatic failure Renal: - Creatinine no greater than 2.5 mg/mL - No renal insufficiency - No history of renal conditions that contraindicate high dosages of sodium Cardiovascular: - No uncontrolled hypertension - No history of congestive heart failure - No other cardiovascular conditions that contraindicate high dosages of sodium Pulmonary: - No serious lung disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) Other: - Not pregnant or nursing - Fertile patients must use effective contraception for 4 weeks before, during, and for 4 weeks after study participation - No active infection - No concurrent serious systemic disease PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - At least 4 weeks since prior immunotherapy and recovered - No concurrent immunomodulating agents Chemotherapy: - At least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy (6 weeks for nitrosoureas) and recovered Endocrine therapy: - Concurrent corticosteroids allowed (e.g., dexamethasone or methylprednisone) Radiotherapy: - At least 8 weeks since prior radiotherapy and recovered Surgery: - Recovered from prior surgery Other: - Prior cytodifferentiating agents allowed - No prior antineoplaston therapy - No other concurrent antineoplastic agents", "gender": "Female", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "recurrent ovarian germ cell tumor", "mesh_term": ["Ovarian Neoplasms"], "id": "NCT00003532"}
