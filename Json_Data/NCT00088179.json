{"brief_title": "Pexelizumab in Patients Undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting With Cardiopulmonary Bypass (PRIMO-CABG II)", "brief_summary": "During a heart bypass procedure, a substance called \"complement\" is activated by the body. This \"complement activation\" causes an inflammatory response that can lead to side affects such as chest pain, heart attacks, stroke, heart failure, or death. The purpose of this study is to find out if the study drug (pexelizumab), that blocks \"complement activation,\" can reduce such side effects and be given safely to patients requiring the bypass procedure with the use of the heart-lung machine.", "condition": ["Coronary Artery Disease"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["pexelizumab in conjunction with CABG"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - be at least 18 years of age; - have 2 or more of the following risk factors: \u2022 diabetes mellitus; \u2022 repeat CABG; \u2022 the need for urgent intervention, defined according to the ACC/AHA guidelines as being patients who are required to stay in the hospital due to medical factors, but may be scheduled and operated on within a normal scheduling routine, excluding patients who have had an MI within 48 hours of CABG; \u2022 female; \u2022 history of a neurologic event (cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack or carotid endarterectomy); \u2022 history of congestive heart failure (NYHA CHF Class III or IV); \u2022 history of 2 MIs, or an MI that occurred greater than 48 hours but less than 4 weeks prior to CABG; - provide Informed Consent.
