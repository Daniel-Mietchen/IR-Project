{"brief_title": "Arsenic Trioxide in Treating Patients With Advanced Neuroblastoma or Other Childhood Solid Tumors", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of arsenic trioxide in treating children who have advanced neuroblastoma or other solid tumors.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rates of patients with advanced neuroblastoma or other pediatric solid tumors treated with arsenic trioxide. - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to type of disease (neuroblastoma with progressive disease vs neuroblastoma with stable refractory disease vs other solid tumor). Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1-4 hours on days 1-5 and 8-12. Treatment repeats every 28 days for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 2-3 months for 1 year and then annually thereafter.", "condition": "Sarcoma", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "arsenic trioxide", "arm_group_label": "Arsenic Trioxide", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed neuroblastoma or other pediatric solid tumor (nonmyeloid and nonlymphoid) including the following: - Ewing's family of tumors/primitive neuroectodermal tumor - Retinoblastoma - Nephroblastoma - Osteosarcoma - Rhabdomyosarcoma - Desmoplastic small round-cell tumor - Hepatoblastoma - Germ cell tumors - Medulloblastoma - Relapsed from or resistant to prior standard anticancer therapy and/or no known standard therapy available - Measurable disease (e.g., solid mass with definable dimensions) OR - Evaluable disease (e.g., bone marrow involvement or malignant pleural effusion) PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 40 and under Performance status: - Not specified Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - Not specified Hepatic: - Bilirubin no greater than 2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) Renal: - Creatinine no greater than 2.5 times ULN Cardiovascular: - Absolute QT interval no greater than 460 msec in the presence of adequate potassium and magnesium levels Other: - No pre-existing neurotoxicity/neuropathy grade 2 or greater - No pre-existing convulsive disorder - No active serious infections uncontrolled by antibiotics - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - Not specified Chemotherapy: - More than 3 weeks since prior cytotoxic chemotherapy - No other concurrent cytotoxic chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: - Not specified Radiotherapy: - Concurrent radiotherapy allowed provided measurable or evaluable disease exists outside radiation field Surgery: - Not specified Other: - No other concurrent investigational agents", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "40 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00024258.xml"}
