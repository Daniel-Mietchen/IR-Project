{"brief_title": "Recombinant Human IL-4 Receptor Used in Treatment of Asthma", "brief_summary": "The purpose is to measure the effectiveness of recombinant human interleukin-4 receptor (IL-4R) in treating asthma. Asthma can be caused by the allergic response from breathing in certain irritants. Interleukin 4 (IL-4), which is naturally produced by the body, plays a major role in this allergic response. Doctors feel that IL-4 activity may be stopped by giving IL-4R, a product that binds to IL-4, and thereby decrease the problems of asthma.", "detailed_description": "A major factor in the pathogenesis of asthma is the development of an allergic inflammatory response to inhaled antigens. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) plays a key role in this response. Binding and inactivating the IL-4 molecule with IL-4R may diminish the allergic asthmatic response by inhibiting activities of IL-4. Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups and, within each group, are stratified by baseline FEV1 cohort. Patients receive either dose level 1 of IL-4R, dose level 2 of IL-4R, or placebo, by aerosol drug delivery device, once a week for 12 weeks. There are frequent clinic visits and several follow-up visits. Physical exams and spirometry are done regularly; immunizations are administered on Day 28; and a skin tests panel is given on Day 84. Blood samples are collected at study visits during treatment and follow-up to test for immunology/serology parameters, chemistry profiles, and asthma-related DNA polymorphisms. Patients are provided with peak flow meters and must demonstrate their proper use so that a peak expiratory flow (PEF) diary and a symptoms diary can be maintained. Selected sites measure exhaled nitric oxide and collect induced sputum samples. Assessments for adverse events are conducted at 16 and 40 weeks following the first study drug treatment.", "condition": ["Asthma"], "intervention_type": ["Biological", "Biological"], "intervention_name": ["Recombinant human soluble IL-4 receptor", "Placebo for Recombinant human soluble IL-4 receptor"], "description": ["Subjects were randomized to twelve once weekly nebulizations of 0.75, 1.5, or 3.0 mg dose of recombinant human soluble IL-4 receptor (rsIL-4R)", "Subjects were randomized to twelve once weekly nebulizations of placebo for recombinant human soluble IL-4 receptor (rsIL-4R).
