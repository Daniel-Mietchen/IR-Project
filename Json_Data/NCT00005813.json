{"brief_title": "Bispecific Antibody Plus White Blood Cells in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Glioblastoma Multiforme", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Bispecific antibodies plus white blood cells may be able to locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining bispecific antibodies with white blood cells in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory glioblastoma multiforme.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Assess the safety and tolerability of bispecific antibody MDX447 and activated monocytes in patients with recurrent or refractory glioblastoma multiforme. - Determine the response, time to tumor progression, and overall survival of these patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients undergo maximal surgical debulking of the tumor at the time of reservoir placement. Within 2-4 weeks after surgery, patients receive one treatment of intratumoral bispecific antibody MDX447 and activated monocytes. Stable or responding patients may receive a second treatment 1 month later. Cohorts of 1 or 3 patients receive escalating doses of bispecific antibody MDX447 and activated monocytes until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 patients experience dose limiting toxicities. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 13 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors"], "intervention_type": ["Biological", "Biological", "Procedure"], "intervention_name": ["bispecific antibody MDX447", "lymphokine-activated killer cells", "conventional surgery"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically proven glioblastoma multiforme with evidence of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression on tumor cell surfaces - No astrocytoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, or oligodendroglioma - No infratentorial or multifocal tumor - Recurrence or progression following at least one prior therapy PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 and over Performance status: - Karnofsky 60-100% Life expectancy: - Greater than 2 months Hematopoietic: - WBC at least 3,000/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 100,000/mm^3 - Hemoglobin greater than 10 g/dL Hepatic: - Bilirubin no greater than 2.0 mg/dL - ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase no greater than 2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) Renal: - Creatinine no greater than 2.0 times ULN Other: - Not pregnant or nursing - Fertile patients must use effective contraception - No other medical or psychiatric illness that would preclude study - No other concurrent malignancy except nonmelanoma skin cancer PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - Not specified Chemotherapy: - At least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy (6 weeks since nitrosoureas) Endocrine therapy: - Concurrent steroid therapy allowed Radiotherapy: - At least 4 weeks since prior radiotherapy Surgery: - Not specified", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "adult gliosarcoma", "mesh_term": ["Glioblastoma", "Nervous System Neoplasms", "Central Nervous System Neoplasms", "Antibodies", "Immunoglobulins", "Antibodies, Bispecific"], "id": "NCT00005813"}
