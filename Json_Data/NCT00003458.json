{"brief_title": "Antineoplaston Therapy in Treating Children With Brain Tumors", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Current therapies for childhood brain tumors provide limited benefit to the patient. The anti-cancer properties of Antineoplaston therapy suggest that it may prove beneficial in the treatment of childhood brain tumors. PURPOSE: This study is being performed to determine the effects (good and bad) that Antineoplaston therapy has on children (> 6 months of age) with brain tumors.", "detailed_description": "OVERVIEW: This is a single arm, open-label study in which children with brain tumors receive gradually escalating doses of intravenous Antineoplaston therapy (Atengenal + Astugenal) until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Treatment continues for at least 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. OBJECTIVES: - To determine the efficacy of Antineoplaston therapy in children with a brain tumor, as measured by an objective response to therapy (complete response, partial response or stable disease). - To determine the safety and tolerance of Antineoplaston therapy in children with a brain tumor. - To determine objective response, tumor size is measured utilizing MRI scans, which are performed every 8 weeks for the first two years, every 3 months for the third and fourth years, every 6 months for the 5th and sixth years, and annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued to this study.", "condition": ["Childhood Brain Tumors"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Antineoplaston therapy (Atengenal + Astugenal)"], "description": ["Children with a brain tumor will receive Antineoplaston therapy (Atengenal + Astugenal)."], "arm_group_label": ["Antineoplaston therapy"], "other_name": ["A10 (Atengenal); AS2-1 (Astugenal)"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed (except if medically contraindicated) childhood brain tumor for which no curative therapy exists - Measurable tumor by MRI scan performed within two weeks prior to study entry - Tumor must be at least 5 mm PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 6 months to 17 years Performance status: - Karnofsky 60-100% Life expectancy: - At least 2 months Hematopoietic: - WBC greater than 2000/mm^3 - Platelet count greater than 50,000/mm^3 Hepatic: - Bilirubin no greater than 2.5 mg/dL - SGOT and SGPT no greater than 5 times upper limit of normal - No hepatic failure Renal: - Creatinine no greater than 2.5 mg/dL - No history of renal conditions that contraindicate high dosages of sodium Cardiovascular: - No severe heart disease - No history of heart failure - No history of other cardiovascular conditions that contraindicate high dosages of sodium - No uncontrolled hypertension Pulmonary: - No severe lung disease Other: - Not pregnant or nursing - Fertile patients must use effective contraception during and for 4 weeks after study participation - No serious active infections or fever - No other serious concurrent disease PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - At least 4 weeks since prior immunotherapy - No concurrent immunomodulating agents Chemotherapy: - At least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy (6 weeks for nitrosoureas) and recovered - No concurrent antineoplastic agents Endocrine therapy: - Concurrent corticosteroids for cerebral edema allowed (must be on stable dose for at least 1 week before study entry) Radiation therapy: - At least 8 weeks since prior radiotherapy and recovered Surgery: - Recovered from any prior surgery Other: - No prior antineoplaston therapy", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "6 Months", "maximum_age": "18 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "Primitive neuroectodermal tumor", "mesh_term": ["Brain Neoplasms"], "id": "NCT00003458"}
