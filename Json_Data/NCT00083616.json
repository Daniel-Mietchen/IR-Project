{"brief_title": "Evaluating Panitumumab (ABX-EGF) Monotherapy in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Following Treatment With Fluoropyrimidine, Irinotecan, and Oxaliplatin Chemotherapy", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to determine that panitumumab will have clinically meaningful anti-tumor activity in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have developed progressive disease or relapsed while on or after prior fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan and oxaliplatin chemotherapy.", "detailed_description": "Panitumumab was administered once every 2 weeks until participants developed progressive disease, were unable to tolerate panitumumab, or discontinued treatment for other reasons (eg, administrative decision). Participants then attended a safety follow-up visit 4 weeks from the last panitumumab infusion. Participants were subsequently contacted every 3 months from the last panitumumab infusion through month 24 to assess disease status and survival.", "condition": "Metastatic Cancer", "intervention_type": "Biological", "intervention_name": "Panitumumab", "description": "Panitumumab 6 mg/kg every once 2 weeks weeks administered by intravenous (IV) infusion.", "arm_group_label": "Panitumumab", "other_name": "Vectibix", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Pathologic diagnosis of colorectal adenocarcinoma (diagnostic tissue obtained by tissue biopsy) - Metastatic colorectal carcinoma - Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1 or 2 - Documented evidence of disease progression during, or following treatment, with fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan and oxaliplatin chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer - Radiographic documentation of disease progression during or within 6 months following the most recent chemotherapy regimen is required - Bidimensionally measurable disease - Tumor expressing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr) by immunohistochemistry - At least 2 but no more than 3 prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic colorectal cancer - Adequate hematologic, renal and hepatic function Exclusion Criteria: - Symptomatic brain metastases requiring treatment - Patient with a history of interstitial pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis or evidence of interstitial pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis - Use of systemic chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 30 days before enrollment - Prior epidermal growth factor receptor targeting agents - Prior anti-tumor therapies including prior experimental agents or approved anti-tumor small molecules and biologics of short (less than 1 week) serum half-life within 30 days before enrollment, or prior experimental or approved proteins with longer serum half-life (e.g., AvastinTM) within 6 weeks before enrollment", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00083616.xml"}
