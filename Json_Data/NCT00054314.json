{"brief_title": "BAY 59-8862 in Treating Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of BAY 59-8862 in treating patients who have non-small cell lung cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the overall response rate, including partial and complete response, in patients with taxane-resistant non-small cell lung cancer treated with BAY 59-8862. - Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this drug. - Determine duration of response and time to progression in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the quantitative and qualitative toxic effects of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive BAY 59-8862 IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with responding disease receive 2-4 additional courses beyond maximal response. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-84 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Lung Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["ortataxel"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically or cytologically confirmed non-small cell lung cancer - Measurable disease - A CNS lesion cannot be the sole target lesion - Must be taxane-resistant as defined by the following criteria: - At least 1 prior course (3 weeks of continuous therapy) of a taxane - Progressive disease developed either during or within 6 months after therapy - No metastatic brain or meningeal tumors unless the following criteria apply: - More than 6 months since definitive therapy - Negative imaging study within the past 4 weeks - Clinically stable with respect to the tumor - No concurrent acute steroid therapy or taper - Chronic steroids allowed provided dose is stable for 1 month before and after screening radiography PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - 18 and over Performance status - ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy - At least 12 weeks Hematopoietic - Absolute neutrophil count at least 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 100,000/mm^3 - Hemoglobin at least 9.0 g/dL Hepatic - Bilirubin no greater than 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) - ALT and AST no greater than 2.5 times ULN (5 times ULN if liver involvement) - No chronic hepatitis B or C Renal - Creatinine no greater than 1.5 times ULN Cardiovascular - No congestive heart failure - No serious cardiac arrhythmias - No active coronary disease or ischemia Other - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective barrier contraception - HIV negative - No active clinically serious infection - No history of seizure disorder - History of seizures related to brain metastasis allowed if seizure free for the past 2 months - No prior hypersensitivity to taxane compounds that was unmanageable with premedication - No pre-existing peripheral neuropathy greater than grade 1 - No other malignancy within the past 3 years except carcinoma in situ of the cervix, adequately treated basal cell carcinoma, or superficial bladder tumors (Ta, Tis, and T1) - No substance abuse - No medical, psychological, or social condition that would preclude study participation or evaluation - No condition that is unstable or would jeopardize patient safety and study compliance PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - More than 3 weeks since prior anticancer immunotherapy - More than 3 weeks since prior biologic response modifiers (e.g., filgrastim [G-CSF]) - More than 4 months since prior bone marrow transplantation or stem cell rescue - No concurrent anticancer immunotherapy - Concurrent epoetin alfa allowed if dose is stable for the past 2 months Chemotherapy - See Disease Characteristics - More than 3 weeks since prior anticancer chemotherapy (6 weeks for mitomycin or nitrosoureas) - No more than 2 prior anticancer chemotherapy regimens (adjuvant therapy is not included unless cancer recurred during or within 6 months after completion of adjuvant therapy) - No prior oxaliplatin - No other concurrent chemotherapy Endocrine therapy - See Disease Characteristics Radiotherapy - More than 3 weeks since prior radiotherapy - No concurrent non-palliative radiotherapy - Palliative radiotherapy allowed provided that all of the following criteria are met: - No progressive disease - No more than 10% of the bone marrow is irradiated - Radiation field does not encompass a target lesion Surgery - More than 4 weeks since prior surgery - No prior organ allograft Other - More than 4 weeks since prior investigational drug therapy - No concurrent non-conventional therapies (e.g., herbs or acupuncture) or vitamin/mineral supplements that would interfere with study endpoints - No other concurrent investigational drug therapy - No other concurrent anticancer therapy", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "recurrent non-small cell lung cancer", "mesh_term": ["Lung Neoplasms", "Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung"], "id": "NCT00054314"}
