{"brief_title": "Robot Assisted Upper Limb Neuro-Rehabilitation", "brief_summary": "Our long term objectives are to understand the mechanisms of motor impairment following neurologic injury and to develop interventions to improve motor recovery. A series of complementary, overlapping clinical trials and development activities will validate and optimize the use of robot-assisted upper limb therapy for neuro rehabilitation. We have developed a robotic system that assists or resists elbow and shoulder movements in three dimensional space. In addition to unilateral exercise modes, a novel bimanual mode enables hemiparetic subjects to practice mirror image upper limb exercises.", "detailed_description": "Randomized controlled clinical trial of the Mirror Image Movement Enabler (MIME) robotic device for shoulder and elbow neurorehabilitation in subacute stroke patients. MIME incorporates a PUMA 560 robot that applies forces to the paretic limb during unilateral and bilateral movements in three dimensions. Robot-assisted treatment (bilateral, unilateral, and combined bilateral and unilateral) was compared with conventional therapy.", "condition": "Acute Stroke", "intervention_type": "Device", "intervention_name": "Traditional therapy", "description": "1 hour/day of upper limb therapy that includes exposure to, but no manipulation by the robot", "arm_group_label": "2", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: Stroke patients Exclusion Criteria: Unable to follow instructions; medically unstable.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00011583.xml"}
