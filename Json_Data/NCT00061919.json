{"brief_title": "Carboplatin and Etoposide With or Without Thalidomide in Treating Patients With Limited-Stage or Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as carboplatin and etoposide use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Thalidomide may stop the growth of cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known if combination chemotherapy is more effective with or without thalidomide in treating small cell lung cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying carboplatin, etoposide, and thalidomide to see how well they work compared to carboplatin and etoposide in treating patients with limited- or extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Compare the survival of patients with limited or extensive stage small cell lung cancer treated with carboplatin and etoposide with vs without thalidomide. - Compare the time to disease progression in patients treated with these regimens. - Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients. - Compare the response rates of patients treated with these regimens. - Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease stage (limited vs extensive), ECOG performance status (0 and 1 vs 2), and alkaline phosphatase (no greater than 1.5 times upper limit of normal [ULN] vs greater than 1.5 times ULN). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and etoposide* IV over 1-2 hours on days 1 and 2 and orally on day 3. Patients also receive oral thalidomide daily beginning on day 1. - Arm II: Patients receive carboplatin and etoposide as in arm I and oral placebo daily beginning on day 1. NOTE: *Patients who are unable to receive etoposide IV on day 2 may receive oral etoposide on days 2 and 3. In both arms, chemotherapy (carboplatin and etoposide) repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses. Patients receive thalidomide or placebo continuously for up to 2 years. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who experience disease progression may continue to receive thalidomide or placebo provided the patient is clinically and symptomatically stable. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, during each course of chemotherapy, at 3-4 weeks after completion of chemotherapy, and at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Patients are followed every 2 months for 2 years after the completion of chemotherapy and then every 3 months thereafter.
