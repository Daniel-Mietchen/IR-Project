{"brief_title": "SDX-105 in Combination With Rituxan for Patients With Relapsed Indolent or Mantle Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL)", "brief_summary": "SUMMARY: This is an open label study combining Rituxan and SDX-105. Rituxan will be given on day 1 followed by a 30-60 minute intravenous infusion of SDX-105 on day 2 and day 3. Treatment will repeat every 21 days (a cycle). Treatment can continue for up to 6 cycles (about 4 months) if tumor status improves and there are no unacceptable side effects. Patients will be followed for up to 2 years or until disease progression. RATIONALE: Rituxan has been shown to increase the sensitivity of cells to chemotherapy. The combination of SDX-105 and Rituxan has been effective in both the laboratory and in a recent clinical study with Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients. PURPOSE: This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of SDX-105 plus Rituxan in patients with Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who have relapsed after taking Rituxan.", "condition": "Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "bendamustine and rituximab", "description": "Patients will receive rituximab on the first day of a cycle at a dose of 375 mg/m2, followed on the second and third day of a cycle by SDX-105 (bendamustine) at a dose of 90 mg/m2/day of treatment. Four cycles are planned. Patients will receive a dose of rituximab alone 7 days prior to the first cycle of the combination and a dose of rituximab 28 days after the last cycle of the combination. If there is documented disease regression, a fifth and sixth cycle of SDX-105 plus rituximab may be administered.", "arm_group_label": "1", "criteria": "INCLUSION CRITERIA: Documented B-Cell NHL or mantle cell lymphoma - CD-20+ tumor - Indolent NHL: follicular B-cell lymphoma, diffuse small lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma - Maximum of three prior chemotherapy regimens - Age of at least 18 years at Screening Visit (Site specific requirement may differ) EXCLUSION CRITERIA: - Refractory to rituximab, defined as progression of disease while being treated with rituximab or progression within 6 months of the last dose of rituximab (when given either as a single agent or in combination) - Previous chemotherapy or immunotherapy within 3 weeks prior to entering the study (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin) or failure to recover from adverse events due to any agents administered previously - Use of investigational agents within 28 days of study - History of prior high dose chemotherapy with allogeneic stem cell support - History of prior radioimmunotherapy", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00076349.xml"}
