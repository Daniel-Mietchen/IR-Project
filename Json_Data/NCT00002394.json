{"brief_title": "Safety and Effectiveness of Giving Lamisil to HIV-Positive Subjects With Thrush Who Have Not Responded to Fluconazole Treatment", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to give Lamisil to HIV-positive patients with thrush (a fungal infection) that has not responded to fluconazole.", "detailed_description": "This is an open-label, dose-escalating study with up to 2 sequential cohorts. The first 15 patients receive Lamisil for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, patients considered clinically cured (i.e., absence of removable, white plaques) are removed from treatment; patients not considered clinically cured receive an additional 2 weeks of treatment. At the end of 4 weeks, treatment is discontinued, regardless of clinical cure outcome. If less than 80% of patients are clinically cured after the 4 weeks of treatment, a second cohort of 15 patients receive Lamisil on the same treatment regimen as first cohort (i.e., initial 2-week treatment period, with an additional 2 weeks of treatment for those patients who are not considered clinically cured after 2 weeks of treatment).", "condition": "HIV Infections", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Terbinafine hydrochloride", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria You may be eligible for this study if you: - Are at least 18 years old. - Have thrush that has not responded to at least 10 days of fluconazole treatment. - Are HIV-positive. - Are expected to live at least 4 weeks. - Are able to take oral medication.
