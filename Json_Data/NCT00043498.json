{"brief_title": "Health Effects of Early-Life Exposure to Urban Pollutants in Minority Children", "brief_summary": "A molecular epidemiologic study of African American and Hispanic mothers and newborns to investigate the role of common urban pollutants on procarcinogenic and developmental damage.", "detailed_description": "The major objective of the proposed research is to study the impact of early-life exposures to common urban pollutants on neurobehavioral development and asthma in a sample of children living in three low-income, minority communities of New York City (Central Harlem, Washington Heights and the South Bronx). Using a molecular epidemiologic approach with monitoring, biomarkers, and clinical assessments at serial time points, we will extend our study of African-American and Latina urban mothers and children in order to follow the cohort through child age 11 years to assess the longer-term impact of exposures on child health and developmental outcomes.", "condition": ["Asthma", "Development"], "study_pop": "\n      ", "sampling_method": "Non-Probability Sample", "criteria": "Enrollment eligibility was restricted to nonsmoking pregnant women 18-35 years of age who self-identified as either African American or Dominican and who had resided in northern Manhattan or the South Bronx in New York City for at least 1 year before pregnancy.
