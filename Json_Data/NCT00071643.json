{"brief_title": "Preventing Post-Stroke Depression", "brief_summary": "This study will evaluate the effectiveness of both drug and non-drug treatments in preventing depression after a stroke.", "detailed_description": "The development of depression after a stroke is a serious condition that can have negative effects on thought, emotions, and overall daily functioning, particularly in the first year following the stroke. Evidence suggests that antidepressants may be used to prevent post-stroke depression. This study will treat nondepressed stroke patients with antidepressants or problem solving therapy (PST) to determine the most effective treatments for preventing depression. Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive PST, escitalopram, or placebo (an inactive pill) for 12 months. Participants who display depressive symptoms for 2 weeks or more will be removed from the study. After 12 months, treatment will be discontinued and participants will be monitored for an additional 6 months.", "condition": ["Depression", "Cerebrovascular Accident"], "intervention_type": ["Behavioral", "Drug", "Other"], "intervention_name": ["Problem Solving Therapy", "Escitalopram", "Placebo"], "description": ["Problem solving therapy aims to make patients aware of symptoms of problems and link those with behaviors associated with solving them.", "Participants will receive escitalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.", "Participants will receive a placebo pill."], "arm_group_label": ["1 Problem Solving Therapy", "2.
