{"brief_title": "Epidemiologic Study of Reproductive Outcome in Women With Systemic Lupus Erythematosus", "brief_summary": "OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate whether pregnancy is an independent risk factor that affects disease activity in women with systemic lupus erythematosus. II. Evaluate whether maternal disease activity is a risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcome.", "detailed_description": "PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a case-controlled study. Intensive data collection begins when a patient becomes pregnant. Pregnant women are evaluated with interval pregnancy/exposure history and a clinical exam, including the Systemic Lupus Activity Measure (SLAM). Assessments are scheduled every 3 months as follows: visit 1 when the pregnancy is confirmed, visit 2 during the second trimester, visit 3 during the third trimester, visit 4 at 3 months postpartum, and visit 5 at 6 months postpartum. Visits 4 and 5 include an infant exam for growth and morphologic parameters; these visits occur on the same schedule if there is a miscarriage or stillbirth. Patients not currently pregnant are randomly chosen to be followed as controls. These patients undergo a review of current pregnancy status and measures of disease activity, including SLAM, every 3 months for 5 visits.", "condition": ["Systemic Lupus Erythematosus"], "criteria": "- Definite or probable systemic lupus erythematosus meeting American College of Rheumatology criteria", "gender": "Female", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "50 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "systemic lupus erythematosus", "mesh_term": ["Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic"], "id": "NCT00004663"}
