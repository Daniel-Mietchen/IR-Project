{"brief_title": "Cisplatin, Paclitaxel, and Gemcitabine in Treating Patients With Progressive Unresectable Regional or Metastatic Bladder Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining cisplatin, paclitaxel, and gemcitabine in treating patients who have progressive unresectable regional or metastatic bladder cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy and toxicity of cisplatin, paclitaxel, and gemcitabine in patients with progressive unresectable regional or metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. - Determine the progression free survival of these patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8, and cisplatin IV over 1 hour and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 6 courses. Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 39 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.", "condition": "Bladder Cancer", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "paclitaxel", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically proven progressive unresectable regional or metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder - Measurable disease by CT or MRI scan - Greater than 10 mm PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 to 75 Performance status: - WHO 0-2 Life expectancy: - At least 3 months Hematopoietic: - Absolute neutrophil count at least 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 150,000/mm^3 Hepatic: - Not specified Renal: - Creatinine less than 1.36 mg/dL Cardiovascular: - No uncontrolled cardiac disease - No severe cardiac arrhythmias Other: - Not pregnant or nursing - No other prior malignancy except curatively treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - Prior intravesical immunotherapy for superficial disease allowed - No prior systemic biologic response modifier therapy for advanced disease Chemotherapy: - Prior intravesical chemotherapy for superficial disease allowed - No prior systemic chemotherapy for advanced disease Endocrine therapy: - Not specified Radiotherapy: - Prior radiotherapy allowed Surgery: - No prior surgery", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "75 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00006118.xml"}
