Patients should have previously received an anthracycline and a taxane. The safety of this treatment will also be studied.", "condition": ["Cancer", "Breast Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Ixabepilone + Capecitabine", "Capecitabine"], "description": ["Ixabepilone lypholized powder/Diluent for solution for injection/Tablets, IV/Oral, 40 mg/m2 + Capecitabine 2000 mg/m2, Ixabepilone on Day 1 and Capecitabine twice daily Days 1-14 of 21 day cycle", "Tablet, Oral, 2500 mg/m2, Capecitabine twice daily Days 1-14 of 21 day cycle"], "arm_group_label": ["A", "B"], "other_name": ["IXEMPRA\u00ae", "Epothilone"], "criteria": "- Patients must have received prior treatment which included both an anthracycline (i.e., doxorubicin or epirubicin) and a taxane (i.e., paclitaxel or docetaxel). - Patients must have received no more than two prior chemotherapy regimens.
