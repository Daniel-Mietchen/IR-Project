{"brief_title": "Study of Ibuprofen to Preserve Lung Function in Patients With Cystic Fibrosis", "brief_summary": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effect of different doses of ibuprofen on neutrophil (polymorphonuclear leukocyte; PMN) delivery to a mucosal surface (the oral mucosa) in patients with cystic fibrosis and healthy controls. II. Determine the duration of effect (and possible rebound effect) of ibuprofen on PMN delivery to a mucosal surface in these patients.", "detailed_description": "PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is an open label study. Patients are randomized into 5 arms, each consisting of 10 healthy volunteers and 5 patients with cystic fibrosis, based on the amount of ibuprofen received during the treatment period. The study period lasts for at least 15 days and consists of 3 periods: baseline (days 1-3), treatment (days 3-12), and recovery (days 13-15 or longer). During the treatment period patients receive ibuprofen orally every 12 hours (except for a control arm that receives no ibuprofen).", "condition": ["Cystic Fibrosis"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["ibuprofen"], "criteria": "PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA: --Disease Characteristics-- Confirmed diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF) based on: Sweat chloride greater than 60 mEq/L AND Typical pulmonary and/or gastrointestinal manifestation of CF OR Healthy volunteers --Prior/Concurrent Therapy-- At least 30 days since medications with anti-neutrophil or anti-inflammatory effect (e.g., aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], corticosteroids, macrolide antibiotics) --Patient Characteristics-- Age: Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF): 5 and over; Healthy volunteers: 18 and over Hematopoietic: No significant history of hematologic disease Hepatic: No significant history of hepatic disease Renal: No significant history of renal disease Cardiovascular: No significant history of cardiovascular disease Pulmonary: See Disease Characteristics Neurologic: No significant history of neurologic disease Other: Not pregnant; No significant history of peptic ulcer disease; Patients with CF free of any acute illness within 14 days; No prior hypersensitivity to any NSAID", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "5 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "Accepts Healthy Volunteers", "keyword": "rare disease", "mesh_term": ["Fibrosis", "Cystic Fibrosis", "Ibuprofen"], "id": "NCT00004440"}
