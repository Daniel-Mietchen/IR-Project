{"brief_title": "HIV Prevention Preparedness Study", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to provide researchers with information that will help them prepare for a future study to test the efficacy of two anti-HIV vaginal gels. This study will also estimate how likely people living in certain areas are to become infected with HIV and other infections passed during sex.", "detailed_description": "This study is designed to prepare for the implementation of a second study, HPTN 035: A Phase II/III Safety and Effectiveness Study of the Vaginal Microbicides BufferGel and PRO 2000/5 Gel (P) for the Prevention of HIV Infection in Women. HPTN 035 requires an average HIV seroincidence rate of 5-6 percent among enrolled participants. The primary objective of the present study is to estimate the rates of HIV seroincidence among women targeted for inclusion in HPTN 035. Women will be enrolled in this study for 6 to 12 months. Study visits will take place monthly. At each visit, participants will complete a medical/menstrual history and undergo pregnancy testing. Each quarter, participants will undergo a structured interview about sexual practices and will receive HIV and STD tests, education, and counseling. Participants will also undergo a pelvic exam with wet mount testing for bacterial vaginosis, candidiasis, and trichomoniasis. Colposcopic evaluations will be performed at selected sites. Pap smears will be performed at sites with the capacity and expertise to prepare and interpret the smears and provide appropriate follow-up care to participants with abnormal results.", "condition": ["HIV Infections", "HIV Seronegativity"], "criteria": "Inclusion criteria: - Sexually active (defined as having had vaginal intercourse at least once in the 3 months prior to screening). - HIV-uninfected at screening. - Able and willing to provide adequate locator information for study retention purposes.
