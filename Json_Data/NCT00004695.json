Determine whether polyethylene-glycol-conjugated interleukin 2 (PEG-IL-2) can reduce the number of infections in patients with common variable immunodeficiency. II. Determine whether this therapy can improve lung functions in these patients with pulmonary impairment.", "detailed_description": "PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label study. Patients are randomized to receive polyethylene-glycol-conjugated interleukin 2 (PEG-IL-2) or placebo. Patients receive PEG-IL-2 or placebo by subcutaneous injection weekly for 18 months. Patients maintain a daily diary for 24 months. Patients are followed every 4 months for 2 years.
