{"brief_title": "Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With HIV-Related Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving methotrexate and zidovudine together with radiation therapy works in treating patients with HIV-related primary central nervous system lymphoma.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy in the treatment of HIV-related primary CNS lymphoma patients. - Evaluate the toxicity and overall survival of these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive chemotherapy consisting of high-dose methotrexate IV administered on day 1 and high-dose zidovudine IV administered on days 1-3 every 2 weeks. Patients receive 3 courses of therapy. Following chemotherapy, patients receive radiation therapy to the lesion site daily. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 14 patients.", "condition": ["Lymphoma"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Procedure", "Radiation"], "intervention_name": ["methotrexate", "zidovudine", "neoadjuvant therapy", "radiation therapy"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically proven HIV-related non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the CNS - No systemic lymphoma PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 and over Performance status: - WHO 0-3 Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - WBC at least 3000/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 80,000/mm^3 Hepatic: - No serious impairment of liver function Renal: - No serious impairment of renal function - Creatinine clearance at least 40 mL/min Cardiovascular: - No serious impairment of cardiac function Neurologic: - Neurological functional status 0-3 Other: - No prior or active CNS-opportunistic infections - No AIDS dementia complex - No active systemic infections PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: - No prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "AIDS-related primary CNS lymphoma", "mesh_term": ["Lymphoma", "Methotrexate", "Zidovudine"], "id": "NCT00003261"}
