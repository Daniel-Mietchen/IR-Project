The usual natural history of thrombotic events and coronary artery disease is telescoped in SLE, so that patients present with these outcomes in their third and fourth decades. DESIGN NARRATIVE: Risk factors addressed in the study included: 1) the hypercoagulable state secondary to antiphospholipid antibodies (the lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibody); 2) premature atherosclerosis, accelerated by prednisone and hypertension; 3) underlying vascular damage from lupus vasculopathy and vasculitis; 4) co-morbid factors, including obesity, smoking, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, sedentary life style, and family history of coronary artery disease, and 5) other factors, including sex, age, race, immunogenetics, compliance with medication, and socioeconomic status. The Hopkins Cohort Study was uniquely able to focus on these issues, both because of its population, which reflected a broad racial, educational, and socioeconomic background, and because the four years of data accumulated showed promising preliminary results. The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the \"End Date\" entered in the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.", "condition": ["Cardiovascular Diseases", "Coronary Disease", "Thrombosis", "Heart Diseases", "Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic"], "criteria": "No eligibility criteria", "gender": "Male", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "100 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "mesh_term": ["Cardiovascular Diseases", "Heart Diseases", "Thrombosis", "Coronary Disease", "Coronary Artery Disease", "Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic"], "id": "NCT00005436"}
