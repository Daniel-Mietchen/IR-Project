{"brief_title": "Attention Deficit Disorder and Exposure to Lead", "brief_summary": "We are examining the past exposure to lead in 250 well characterized children with ADHD, and a suitable group of controls. Our measure of past exposure is bone lead levels obtained by XRay fluorescence spectroscopy, a relatively new way of estimating bone lead concentrations, and by inference, body lead burdens. By comparing the lead concentrations in these two groups, controlling for other factors which could confound, we will estimate odds ratios for ADHD given elevated bone lead, and estimate the contribution of lead to this disease of childhood.", "condition": "Attention Deficit Disorder", "criteria": "Case subjects are drawn from adolescents aged 10 to 18 previously seen at Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic for evaluation, and meet the DSM-IIIR criteria for diagnosis of ADHD based on a structured parent interview and standardized parent and teacher rating scales. Cases were also systematically observed and evaluated in the summer treatment program between 1987 and 1996 at WPIC. Controls are demographically matched non-ADHD adolescents, recruited from surrounding communities and pediatric practices.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "10 Years", "maximum_age": "18 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "Accepts Healthy Volunteers", "id": "NCT00014898.xml"}
