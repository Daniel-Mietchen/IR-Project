{"brief_title": "Chemotherapy Combined With Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Limited-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effect on the body when combining irinotecan and cisplatin with radiation therapy in treating patients who have limited-stage small cell lung cancer that could not be completely removed during surgery.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of irinotecan administered with cisplatin and thoracic radiotherapy (given at two different schedules) in patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer. - Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity and non-dose-limiting toxicity of these regimens in these patients. - Determine the reversibility of all toxic effects associated with these regimens in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, dose-escalation study of irinotecan. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 radiotherapy (RT) treatment groups. - Radiotherapy: - Group I: Patients undergo thoracic RT twice daily, 5 days a week, for 3 weeks. - Group II: Patients undergo thoracic RT once daily, 5 days a week, for 7 weeks. - Concurrent chemotherapy: Patients receive irinotecan IV over 60-90 minutes on days 1 and 8 and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 1 course for group I and 2 courses for group II. - Post RT chemotherapy: Patients receive irinotecan and cisplatin as above for 3 courses for group I and 2 courses, beginning after RT is complete, for group II. Sequential cohorts of 6 patients per group receive escalating doses of irinotecan until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then 6 months for 4 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-36 patients (6-18 per group) will be accrued for this study within 18 months.", "condition": ["Lung Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Radiation"], "intervention_name": ["cisplatin", "irinotecan hydrochloride", "radiation therapy"], "arm_group_label": ["Sequence A: Level 1", "Sequence B: Level 1", "Sequence A: Level 2", "Sequence B: Level 2", "Sequence A: Level 3", "Sequence B: Level 3", "Sequence A: Level 1", "Sequence B: Level 1", "Sequence A: Level 2", "Sequence B: Level 2", "Sequence A: Level 3", "Sequence B: Level 3", "Sequence A: Level 1", "Sequence B: Level 1", "Sequence A: Level 2", "Sequence B: Level 2", "Sequence A: Level 3", "Sequence B: Level 3"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically or cytologically confirmed small cell lung cancer by one of two methods: - Fine needle aspiration biopsy - Two positive sputa - Must have limited disease as defined by all of the following: - Stage I-IIIB - Confined to 1 hemithorax - No T4 tumor based on malignant pleural or pericardial effusion - Patients with pleural effusion too small to tap under CT guidance and not evident on chest x-ray are allowed - No N3 disease based on contralateral hilar or contralateral supraclavicular involvement - Measurable or evaluable disease - Tumor must be able to be encompassed by specified radiotherapy fields without unacceptable risk of serious pulmonary compromise - No complete tumor resection - No pericardial effusion (regardless of cytology) PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - 18 and over Performance status - Zubrod 0-1 Life expectancy - Not specified Hematopoietic - Absolute granulocyte count at least 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 120,000/mm^3 Hepatic - Bilirubin no greater than 1.5 mg/dL - No known Gilbert's disease Renal - Creatinine no greater than 1.5 mg/dL Cardiovascular - No myocardial infarction within the past 6 months - No symptomatic heart disease Pulmonary - Forced expiratory volume (FEV)_1 at least 1.0 L/sec - No uncontrolled bronchospasms - No uncompensated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Other - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception - No pre-existing peripheral neuropathy grade 2 or greater - No other malignancy within the past 2 years except curatively treated basal or squamous cell skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the bladder or cervix - No other concurrent serious medical illness PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - No prior biologic therapy Chemotherapy - No prior chemotherapy Endocrine therapy - Not specified Radiotherapy - No prior radiotherapy - No concurrent intensity-modulated radiotherapy Surgery - See Disease Characteristics Other - At least 7 days since prior enzyme-inducing anti-convulsant drugs (EIACDs) (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, or phenobarbital) if used on a regular basis for more than 2 weeks - Less than 2 weeks of regular use of EIACDs does not require a 7-day wash-out period - At least 14 days since prior Hypericum perforatum (St. John's wort) - No concurrent EIACDs - No concurrent amifostine during chemoradiotherapy - Concurrent gabapentin or other non-EIACDs allowed", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "limited stage small cell lung cancer", "mesh_term": ["Lung Neoplasms", "Small Cell Lung Carcinoma", "Irinotecan", "Cisplatin", "Camptothecin"], "id": "NCT00059761"}
