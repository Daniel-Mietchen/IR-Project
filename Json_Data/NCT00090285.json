{"brief_title": "An Investigational Study of Gardasil\u2122 (qHPV, V501) Vaccine in Reducing the Incidence of Anogenital Warts in Young Men (V501-020)", "brief_summary": "This study is to evaluate an investigational vaccine with the following objectives: to demonstrate that the vaccine is well tolerated in young men; to demonstrate that the vaccine reduces incidence of external genital lesions (Condylomata acuminata [anogenital warts], penile/perianal/perineal intraepithelial neoplasia [PIN], penile, perianal, perineal cancer) in young men; to demonstrate that the vaccine reduces the incidence of anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) or anal cancer in men having sex with men (MSM); and to demonstrate that the vaccine reduces incidence of Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) infection in young men.", "detailed_description": "The base study (V501-020) encompassed Day 1 through Month 7, during which time participants received randomly assigned Gardasil\u2122 (qHPV vaccine) or placebo at Day 1, Month 2, and Month 6. Base study follow-up continued through Month 36. The base study was extended in protocol V501-020-10 Extension 1 (EXT1). Participants who received placebo and participants who received only 1 dose of qHPV vaccine in the base study were offered a complete 3-dose qHPV vaccine regimen (administered at EXT1 Day 1, Month 2 and Month 6). Participants who received only 2 doses of qHPV vaccine in the base study were offered a single additional dose of qHPV vaccine (administered at EXT1 Day 1). Participants were followed to EXT1 Month 7. A second extension study, V501-020-21 (EXT2), will estimate the long-term safety and effectiveness of qHPV vaccine during a period of 10 years following initial enrollment in the base study. Subjects who received at least one dose of qHPV vaccine in either the base study or EXT1 are eligible to enroll in EXT2.", "condition": ["Condylomata Acuminata"], "intervention_type": ["Biological", "Biological"], "intervention_name": ["(Gardasil\u2122) human papillomavirus (types 6, 11, 16, 18) recombinant vaccine", "Comparator: placebo (unspecified)"], "description": ["Duration of Treatment: 6 months", "Duration of Treatment: 6 months"], "arm_group_label": ["qHPV Vaccine", "Placebo"], "other_name": ["qHPV", "V501"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Healthy male between the ages of 16 years and 23 years and 364 days.
