{"brief_title": "Efficacy and Safety of PG-530742 in the Treatment of Mild to Moderate Knee Osteoarthritis", "brief_summary": "Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been implicated in the cartilage degradation. PG-530742 inhibits some MMPs, potentially limiting cartilage degradation and disease progression. This study will test the efficacy and safety of PG-530742 in the treatment of mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis.", "detailed_description": "Matrix metalloproteinases have been implicated in the cartilage degradation that occurs in osteoarthritis.
