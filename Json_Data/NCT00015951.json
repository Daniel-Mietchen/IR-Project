{"brief_title": "Bevacizumab, Cytarabine, and Mitoxantrone on Treating Patients With Hematologic Cancers", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as bevacizumab can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Combining monoclonal antibody therapy with chemotherapy may be an effective treatment for hematologic cancer. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bevacizumab combined with cytarabine and mitoxantrone in treating patients who have hematologic cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the clinical effectiveness of bevacizumab, cytarabine, and mitoxantrone in patients with poor-risk hematologic malignancies. - Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. - Determine whether this regimen can induce cell apoptosis in these patients. - Determine the effects of bevacizumab on coagulation profiles in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive cytarabine IV continuously over 72 hours on days 1-3, mitoxantrone IV over 30-60 minutes on day 4, and bevacizumab IV over 90 minutes on day 8 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving partial or complete remission may receive a second course of therapy beginning approximately 30 days after the completion of the first course. Patients are followed until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-45 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-3 years.", "condition": "Myelodysplastic Syndromes", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "mitoxantrone hydrochloride", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed poor-risk hematologic malignancy - Relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) - Primary induction failure - Myelodysplasia(MDS)-related AML - Secondary AML - Relapsed or refractory MDS - Primary induction failure - Refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) - RAEB in transformation - Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia - Chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis - Failure of prior primary induction therapy or relapse after achieving complete remission allowed only if no more than 3 courses of prior induction/reinduction therapy were received - No hyperleukocytosis (50,000 or more leukemic blasts/mm3) - No active CNS leukemia PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 and over Performance status: - ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - See Disease Characteristics - No disseminated intravascular coagulation Hepatic: - AST/ALT no greater than 2 times normal - Alkaline phosphatase no greater than 2 times normal - Bilirubin no greater than 1.5 times normal Renal: - Creatinine no greater than 1.5 times normal Cardiovascular: - LVEF at least 45% by MUGA or echocardiogram - No myocardial infarction within the past 3 months - No history of severe coronary artery disease - No cardiomyopathy - No New York Heart Association class III or IV heart disease (congestive heart failure) Other: - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception - No active uncontrolled infection - No history of cytarabine-related neurotoxicity - No evidence of graft-versus-host disease PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - At least 1 week since prior hematopoietic growth factors including epoetin alfa, filgrastim (G-CSF), and sargramostim (GM-CSF) - At least 1 week since prior interleukin-3 or interleukin-11 - At least 4 weeks since prior autologous stem cell transplantation - At least 90 days since prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation - No other concurrent immunotherapy Chemotherapy: - See Disease Characteristics - At least 3 weeks since prior chemotherapy and recovered - No prior cytarabine administered as a 72-hour continuous infusion followed by mitoxantrone IV over 30 minutes - No other concurrent chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: - Not specified Radiotherapy: - No concurrent radiotherapy Surgery: - Not specified Other: - At least 2 weeks since prior immunosuppressive therapy - No other concurrent investigational or commercially available antitumor therapy", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00015951.xml"}
