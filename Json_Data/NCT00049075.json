{"brief_title": "Fludarabine in Treating Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of fludarabine in treating patients who have chronic lymphocytic leukemia that has not been previously treated.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the overall response rate (complete and partial) in patients with previously untreated B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with oral fludarabine. - Determine the molecular complete response rate in patients who achieve a clinical or immunophenotypic complete response when treated with this drug. - Determine the progression-free and treatment-free survival of patients treated with this drug. - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. - Determine the baseline incidence of defined genetic abnormalities in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the prognostic and predictive significance of defined genetic abnormalities in patients with respect to response to treatment with this drug. - Determine the prognostic and predictive significance of immunophenotypic profile of patients with respect to response to treatment with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral fludarabine on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6-8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients in complete remission after 6 courses do not receive further study therapy. Patients are followed at 2 months and then every 4 months for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.", "condition": "Leukemia", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "fludarabine phosphate", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Confirmed diagnosis of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) - Previously untreated - Rai stage I, II, III, or IV - Requiring systemic therapy - Persistent lymphocytosis of greater than 5,000/mm^3 - Morphologically mature lymphocytes - Monoclonal B-cell population - CD19/CD5/CD23 positive with kappa or lambda light chain restriction by immunophenotyping - No other lymphoproliferative disorders including prolymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, progression to aggressive B-cell lymphoma, or Richter's syndrome - No clinical autoimmune hematologic complication of CLL including Coomb's-positive hemolytic anemia or immune thrombocytopenia - Positive Coomb's test allowed if no clinical hemolysis PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - 16 and over Performance status - ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy - At least 6 months Hematopoietic - See Disease Characteristics Hepatic - Bilirubin no greater than 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) - AST and/or ALT no greater than 2 times ULN Renal - Creatinine no greater than 2 times ULN Other - Accessible for treatment and follow-up - No known HIV infection - No active bacterial, viral, or fungal infection requiring systemic antibiotics - No conditions requiring corticosteroid therapy - No history of other malignancies except for the following: - Adequately treated nonmelanoma skin cancer - Curatively treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix - Other solid tumors curatively treated with no evidence of disease within the past 5 years - No other major medical illness that would preclude study - No known hypersensitivity to fludarabine or its components - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception during and for at least 6 months after study PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - No concurrent immunotherapy including monoclonal antibody therapy - No concurrent autologous or allogeneic stem cell or bone marrow transplantation Chemotherapy - No other concurrent cytotoxic drugs Endocrine therapy - No concurrent corticosteroids except inhaled or topical corticosteroids - No concurrent corticosteroids for nausea prophylaxis Radiotherapy - No prior radiotherapy affecting more than 25% of bone marrow and/or involving the pelvic area - No concurrent radiotherapy Surgery - Not specified Other - At least 4 weeks since prior investigational agents - No other concurrent investigational agents", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "16 Years", "maximum_age": "120 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00049075.xml"}
