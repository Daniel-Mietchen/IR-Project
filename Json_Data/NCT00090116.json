{"brief_title": "The Safety and Efficacy of Neramexane in Patients With Moderate to Severe Alzheimer's Disease", "brief_summary": "Memory loss and difficulties with thinking associated with Alzheimer's disease may be due to chronic release of a brain chemical called glutamate. Glutamate helps transmit messages between nerve cells through interaction with a certain type of receptor (N-methyl-D-aspartate, NMDA) on the cell. Neramexane is a new drug that blocks the effects of excessive glutamate at the receptor (NMDA receptor antagonist).", "condition": "Alzheimer's Disease", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Neramexane", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Clinical diagnosis of moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease; - ambulatory patients Exclusion Criteria: - folate deficiency; - clinically significant central nervous system disease other than Alzheimer's disease; - clinically significant pulmonary, gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, endocrine or cardiovascular disease", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "50 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00090116.xml"}
