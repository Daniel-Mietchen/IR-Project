{"brief_title": "Chemotherapy Followed by Biological Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage IV Melanoma That Cannot be Treated With Surgery", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Biological therapies such as interleukin-2 and interferon alfa stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill cancer cells or may interfere with the growth of cancer cells. Combining chemotherapy with biological therapies may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of temozolomide followed by sargramostim, interleukin-2, and interferon alfa in treating patients who have stage IV melanoma that cannot be treated with surgery.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate, time to progression, and survival of patients with unresectable stage IV melanoma treated with temozolomide followed by sargramostim (GM-CSF), interleukin-2, and interferon alfa. - Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in this patient population. - Determine the changes in quality of life over time in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral temozolomide on days 1-5, and sargramostim (GM-CSF), interleukin-2, and interferon alfa subcutaneously on days 6-17. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4-8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with at least stable or responsive disease after 8 courses of therapy may receive additional therapy at investigators discretion. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 8 weeks during study, and then at 1 month after study. Patients are followed at 1 month, every 3 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.", "condition": ["Melanoma (Skin)"], "intervention_type": ["Biological", "Biological", "Biological", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["aldesleukin", "recombinant interferon alfa", "sargramostim", "temozolomide"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed unresectable stage IV melanoma - Measurable metastatic disease - No uncontrolled brain metastases PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 and over Performance status: - Karnofsky 70-100% Life expectancy: - More than 12 weeks Hematopoietic: - Absolute neutrophil count at least 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 100,000/mm^3 - Hemoglobin at least 10 g/dL Hepatic: - Bilirubin no greater than 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) - SGOT and SGPT no greater than 3 times ULN - Alkaline phosphatase no greater than 3 times ULN Renal: - BUN no greater than 1.5 times ULN - Creatinine no greater than 1.5 times ULN Cardiovascular: - No significant cardiovascular disease Other: - No non-malignant systemic disease - No acute infection requiring IV antibiotics - No alcohol or substance abuse - No other condition, disease, or history of other illness that would preclude study participation - No hypersensitivity, allergic reactions, or intolerance to study drugs - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - At least 4 weeks since prior immunotherapy - No prior interleukin-2 - No other concurrent immunotherapy - No concurrent investigational vaccines or immunomodulatory agents - No other concurrent growth factors Chemotherapy: - At least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy - No prior temozolomide - No other concurrent anticancer chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: - No concurrent steroids (including corticosteroids) Radiotherapy: - At least 4 weeks since prior radiotherapy Surgery: - See Disease Characteristics - At least 3 weeks since prior major surgery Other: - At least 30 days since prior immune-based therapy - No concurrent participation in other clinical trials with investigational drugs - No other concurrent anticancer drugs - No concurrent immunosuppressive therapy - No concurrent levamisole or cimetidine", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "recurrent melanoma", "mesh_term": ["Melanoma", "Temozolomide", "Aldesleukin", "Interferons", "Interferon-alpha"], "id": "NCT00014092"}
