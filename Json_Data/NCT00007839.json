{"brief_title": "Beta Alethine in Treating Patients With Low-Grade Lymphoma", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Biological therapies such as beta alethine use different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop cancer cells from growing. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of beta alethine in treating patients who have low-grade lymphoma.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the antitumor effects of low-dose beta-alethine in patients with low grade B-cell lymphoma. - Assess the effects of this regimen on delayed-type hypersensitivity in these patients. - Assess the safety of this regimen in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is an multicenter study. Patients receive low-dose beta-alethine subcutaneously once every 2 weeks for a total of 6 doses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients with no evidence of tumor progression may receive additional courses of therapy. Patients are followed for 2 weeks from the last dose or for a minimum of 30 days if they withdraw due to an adverse event. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 13-37 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": "Lymphoma", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "beta alethine", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed low grade B-cell lymphoma - Measurable residual disease after maximal response to prior chemotherapy OR - Indolent disease not yet requiring therapy - No congenital immunodeficiency associated lymphoma - No primary lymphoma of the brain - No active brain involvement or leptomeningeal disease NOTE: A new classification scheme for adult non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ. The terminology of \"indolent\" or \"aggressive\" lymphoma will replace the former terminology of \"low\", \"intermediate\", or \"high\" grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses the former terminology.
