{"brief_title": "Chemotherapy, Tirapazamine, and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Tirapazamine may make the tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Combining chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and tirapazamine may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining chemotherapy with tirapazamine and radiation therapy in treating patients who have stage II or stage III non-small cell lung cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of tirapazamine when administered with paclitaxel, carboplatin, and concurrent radiotherapy in patients with stage IIB-IIIB non-small cell lung cancer. - Determine, preliminarily, the response rate and survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of tirapazamine. Patients receive induction chemotherapy comprising tirapazamine IV over 2 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36 and paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, 25, 29, 32, 36, and 39. Beginning on day 1, patients undergo radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 6.5 weeks. Beginning 4-5 weeks after completion of radiotherapy, patients with stable or responding disease receive consolidation chemotherapy comprising paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 22. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tirapazamine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 3-30 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Lung Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Drug", "Radiation"], "intervention_name": ["carboplatin", "paclitaxel", "tirapazamine", "radiation therapy"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically or cytologically confirmed primary bronchogenic non-small cell lung cancer - Adenocarcinoma - Large cell carcinoma - Squamous cell carcinoma - Stage IIIA or IIIB disease (T1-4, N2-3) - Mediastinal lymph nodes at least 2 cm in diameter by radiography sufficient to stage N2-3 (must be node positive [cytologically or histologically confirmed] if largest mediastinal node is less than 2 cm in diameter) OR - Selected stage IIB disease (T3, N0 or T3, N1 with a medical condition that precludes surgery) - No malignant pleural effusion - Measurable or evaluable disease by chest x-ray or CT scan - No metastatic disease PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 and over Performance status: - Zubrod 0-2 OR - ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - WBC at least 3,500/mm^3 - Platelet count normal Hepatic: - Not specified Renal: - Creatinine clearance at least 60 mL/min Cardiovascular: - No uncontrolled congestive heart failure - No unstable angina - No unstable cardiac arrhythmias Pulmonary: - FEV_1 at least 1.0 L Other: - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception - No clinically significant hearing loss PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - Not specified Chemotherapy: - No prior chemotherapy for lung cancer Endocrine therapy: - Not specified Radiotherapy: - No prior radiotherapy for lung cancer Surgery: - See Disease Characteristics", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "adenocarcinoma of the lung", "mesh_term": ["Lung Neoplasms", "Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung", "Paclitaxel", "Tirapazamine", "Albumin-Bound Paclitaxel", "Carboplatin"], "id": "NCT00033410"}
