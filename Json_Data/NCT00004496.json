{"brief_title": "Phase I Study of Alpha-Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone in Patients With Acute Renal Failure", "brief_summary": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and safety of alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) in patients with acute renal failure. II. Determine the safety and pharmacokinetics of alpha-MSH in patients at high risk of acute renal failure after renal transplantation. III. Determine the safety and pharmacokinetics of alpha-MSH in patients with established ischemic acute renal failure. IV. Determine the effect of alpha-MSH on interleukin-10 pharmacokinetics.", "detailed_description": "PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study. Group 1: Patients are infused with alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) or placebo over 5 minutes. A cohort of 5 patients is infused at each dose level of alpha-MSH until the minimum effective dose (MED) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) are determined. Group 2: Patients receive a single dose of the MED of alpha-MSH IV over 5 minutes at the time anastomoses are complete. Other patients receive alpha-MSH at the MTD. Cohorts of 5 patients each are treated at the MED and the MTD. Group 3: Patients receive alpha-MSH as in group 2. Additional dose levels are also tested.
