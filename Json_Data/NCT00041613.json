{"brief_title": "Study to Compare the Overall Survival of Patients Receiving INGN 201 (Study Drug) With Patients Receiving Methotrexate", "brief_summary": "There is a need for more treatment options for patients with recurrent squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (SCCHN). These tumors usually have a variety of genetic defects that include disruption of the p53 pathway, a pathway that would ordinarily work to prevent the development of tumors. In this study the transfer of the p53 gene to tumor cells using a modified adenovirus (INGN 201) will be compared to methotrexate in patients who have failed surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy with platinum or taxanes.", "condition": ["Carcinoma, Squamous Cell"], "intervention_type": ["Genetic"], "intervention_name": ["INGN 201"], "criteria": "- 18 years or older - Not eligible for surgery - Must have had radiation and chemotherapy treatments - No prior methotrexate treatments", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "Refractory Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck", "mesh_term": ["Carcinoma, Squamous Cell"], "id": "NCT00041613"}
