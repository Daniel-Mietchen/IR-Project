{"brief_title": "Zidovudine Levels in HIV Infected Patients Being Treated for HCV", "brief_summary": "This study will test the amount of anti-HIV drugs in the blood cells of HIV-infected patients who are also being treated for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.", "detailed_description": "An estimated 50,000 people in Puerto Rico are infected with HCV. HIV and HCV have similar routes of transmission, and HCV co-infection occurs in 8% to 23% of HIV infected patients. Researchers have shown that treatment for HCV with Rebetron (ribavirin plus interferon alfa-2b) significantly decreases HCV viral load without affecting HIV viral load. However, measurements of intracellular levels of the active forms of zidovudine (ZDV-MP and ZDV-TP) were not performed. Such measurements are needed to provide a more rational basis for dosing in HIV/HCV co-infected patients. This study will investigate the intracellular exposure to active ZDV metabolites prior to and after treatment with Rebetron or treatment with PEG-Intron (pegylated interferon) and ribavirin. Participants in this study will remain on their usual antiretroviral regimen; no changes may be made to that regimen for the first 4 weeks of the study. Upon study entry, participants will have intracellular pharmacokinetic studies. During Week 2, participants will start either Rebetron or PEG-Intron plus ribavirin therapy, will have intracellular pharmacokinetic studies, and will undergo liver biopsy. Additional intracellular pharmacokinetic studies will be performed at Weeks 12 and 24. Rebetron or PEG-Intron plus ribavirin will be given for 48 weeks. A second liver biopsy will be performed 24 weeks after discontinuing Rebetron or PEG-Intron plus ribavirin therapy. Participants will be followed for 72 weeks.", "condition": "Hepatitis C", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Peginterferon alfa-2b", "description": "Subcutaneous injection", "arm_group_label": "1", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria - HCV-infected - HIV-1 infection - CD4 cell count > 200 cells/mm\u00b3 within 30 days prior to study entry - HIV RNA < 400 copies/ml within 90 days of study entry - Use of zidovudine, lamivudine, and any PI and/or NNRTI - ANC value >= 1,500 ml\u00b3 within 30 days of study entry - Weight > 50 kg (110 lbs) for women and > 60 kg (132 lbs) for men - Acceptable methods of contraception - Ability and willingness to complete the Baseline Adherence Questionnaire - Documentation of adherence confirmed by the Baseline Adherence Questionnaire and certified by the study officials Exclusion Criteria - Previous ribavirin therapy - More than 2 months of interferon therapy - Current use of any NRTI other than ZDV and 3TC - Hepatitis B surface antigen positive - Infectious, autoimmune, tumoral, biliary, or vascular liver disease - Alcohol consumption of more than 50 g/day - Current use of intravenous drugs - Hemoglobin levels < 10 gm/dl - Methadone use - Chemotherapy - Certain medications - Acute opportunistic or bacterial infection requiring therapy at the time of enrollment - Hemoglobinopathy (e.g., thalassemia) or any other cause of tendency to hemolysis - Psychiatric disorders, severe depression, history of suicide attempts, or suicidal ideation - Renal disease requiring dialysis - Significant coronary diseases or two or more risk factors for coronary diseases, such as > 55 years old, hypertension, and cholesterol > 250 mg/dl - Any clinically significant diseases (other than HIV and HCV infection) that, in the opinion of study officials, would compromise the outcome of this study - Pregnancy - Participation in blinded clinical trial", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "21 Years", "maximum_age": "60 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00059358.xml"}
