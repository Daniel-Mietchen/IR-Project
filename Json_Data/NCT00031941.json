{"brief_title": "CC-5013 in Treating Patients With Cancer That Has Not Responded to Previous Therapy", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: CC-5013 may stop the growth of cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of CC-5013 in treating patients who have solid tumors and/or lymphoma that did not respond to previous therapy.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of CC-5013 in patients with refractory solid tumors and/or lymphoma. - Characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of this drug in these patients. - Determine whether any correlations can be made between plasma concentrations of this drug and toxicity or clinical activity or biological activity in these patients. - Characterize the side effect profile of this drug in these patients. - Determine the dose-limiting toxicity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive oral CC-5013 on day 1. Within 4-10 days, patients begin second course and receive oral CC-5013 once daily on days 1-21. Subsequent courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of CC-5013 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 2 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-51 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Lymphoma", "Small Intestine Cancer", "Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["lenalidomide"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed refractory solid tumor and/or lymphoma - No brain metastases or primary CNS malignancies PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 and over Performance status: - ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy: - More than 3 months Hematopoietic: - Granulocyte count at least 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 100,000/mm^3 Hepatic: - Bilirubin normal - ALT and AST less than 2.5 times normal Renal: - Creatinine no greater than 1.5 mg/dL OR - Creatinine clearance greater than 60 mL/min Cardiovascular: - No unstable or newly diagnosed angina pectoris - No myocardial infarction within the past 6 months - No New York Heart Association class II, III, or IV congestive heart failure Pulmonary: - No chronic obstructive lung disease requiring oxygen therapy Other: - No uncontrolled seizures - No concurrent acute critical illness - No serious untreated infection - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception during and for 2 months after study participation PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - At least 4 weeks since prior biologic therapy Chemotherapy: - At least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy (6 weeks for nitrosoureas, mitomycin, or carboplatin) - No concurrent cytotoxic chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: - At least 4 weeks since prior hormonal therapy - Concurrent luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist required in patients with prostate cancer unless prior orchiectomy has been performed Radiotherapy: - At least 4 weeks since prior radiotherapy Surgery: - See Endocrine therapy - Prior surgery allowed Other: - Recovered from prior therapy - No concurrent anticonvulsants (e.g., phenobarbital, phenytoin, or carbamazepine) - No concurrent rifampin - No concurrent grapefruit juice", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "splenic marginal zone lymphoma", "mesh_term": ["Lymphoma", "Intestinal Neoplasms", "Lenalidomide"], "id": "NCT00031941"}
