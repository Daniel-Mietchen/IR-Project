{"brief_title": "Comparison of GW433908 and Nelfinavir in HIV Patients Who Have Not Had Antiretroviral Therapy", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to compare GW433908 and nelfinavir when each is given with abacavir and lamivudine to HIV patients who have not taken antiretroviral drugs.", "detailed_description": "Patients are randomized in a 2:1 scheme to 1 of 2 treatment groups. Group 1 receives GW433908 plus abacavir (ABC) plus lamivudine (3TC); Group 2 receives nelfinavir (NFV) plus ABC plus 3TC. Patients undergo safety and efficacy assessments at the Screening Visit, Day 1 (Entry), and Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and every 8 weeks thereafter. A follow-up visit is performed 4 weeks after the permanent discontinuation of study drug. Detailed assessments for the development of lipodystrophy/fat redistribution occur at Day 1, Week 24, Week 48, and every 16 weeks thereafter. Patients have examinations and laboratory tests performed at visits.", "condition": ["HIV Infections"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Abacavir sulfate", "Nelfinavir mesylate", "Lamivudine", "GW433908"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria Patients may be eligible for this study if they: - Are at least 13 years old (consent of parent or guardian required if under 18). - Agree to use a proven barrier method of birth control (e.g., spermicide plus condom) during the study period (hormonal birth control will not be accepted), if able to have children. - Have received less than 4 weeks treatment with any nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) and have never received any nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRT) or protease inhibitor (PI). - Have a viral load (amount of HIV in the blood) of 5,000 copies/ml or more, or have a positive result at the screening visit.
