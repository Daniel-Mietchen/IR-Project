{"brief_title": "Phase II/III Study of the Tolerance and Efficacy of Combined Use of Didanosine (2',3'-Dideoxyinosine; ddI) and Lentinan in HIV-Positive Patients", "brief_summary": "To determine the tolerance and side effects of a combination of lentinan and didanosine (ddI) in comparison with ddI alone. To determine whether the combination of lentinan and ddI produces a significant immunorestorative effect within the study observation period (6-12 months) as measured by an increase in one or more of the following: neutrophil count and activity, T-cell subsets, and a decrease in p24 antigen.", "detailed_description": "Patients are treated with daily oral ddI for 6 weeks, then are randomized to ddI in combination with intravenous lentinan or placebo (administered once weekly) for 26 weeks. Patients who are already stabilized on 400 mg/day ddI will proceed directly to randomization. Following completion of the combination therapy, patients may be offered 26 additional weeks of therapy on an optional basis.", "condition": ["HIV Infections"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Lentinan", "Didanosine"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria Patients must have: - HIV seropositivity. - Absolute CD4 count of 200 - 500 cells/mm3. - No active opportunistic infection or Kaposi's sarcoma.
