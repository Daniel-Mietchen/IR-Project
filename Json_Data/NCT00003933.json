{"brief_title": "Diagnostic Study of Gene Alterations in Children Who Have Been Treated for Relapsed Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as genetic testing, may improve the ability to detect acute lymphocytic leukemia and determine the extent of disease. PURPOSE: Diagnostic study to try to detect changes in the genes of children who have been treated for relapsed acute lymphocytic leukemia.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the incidence of p16/p15 homozygous deletions and p15 promoter hypermethylation in acute lymphocytic leukemia cells of children treated on protocol CCG-1941. - Determine the prognostic importance of p16/p15 abnormalities in these children. - Determine the presence or absence of p16/p15 abnormalities in the dominant clone at diagnosis if present at relapse in these patients. OUTLINE: Frozen cells are obtained from samples collected on protocol CCG-1941. DNA is isolated and examined using Southern blot analysis to assay for deletions and promoter hypermethylation of p16 and/or p15. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 100 samples will be obtained for this study.", "condition": ["Leukemia"], "intervention_type": ["Other"], "intervention_name": ["laboratory biomarker analysis"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Diagnosis of acute lymphocytic leukemia and treated on protocol CCG-1941 - Material cryopreserved in the CCG cell bank PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - Children Performance status: - Not specified Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - Not specified Hepatic: - Not specified Renal: - Not specified PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - Not specified Chemotherapy: - Not specified Endocrine therapy: - Not specified Radiotherapy: - Not specified Surgery: - Not specified Other: - See Disease Characteristics", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "17 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "recurrent childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia", "mesh_term": ["Leukemia"], "id": "NCT00003933"}
