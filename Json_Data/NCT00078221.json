{"brief_title": "Rheopheresis Blood Filtration Study for the Treatment of Dry Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)", "brief_summary": "AMD is a progressive disease of the retina which is nourished by a network of tiny blood vessels. There is evidence to suggest that the flow of nutrients to the retina is impaired in patients with AMD. Rheopheresis blood filtration uses blood filters that deplete excesses of large proteins, fats and other substances from the blood, improving blood flow to the macula, potentially improving vision.", "condition": ["Macular Degeneration"], "intervention_type": ["Device"], "intervention_name": ["Rheopheresis blood filtration"], "criteria": "- Age 50-85 - Diagnosis of Dry AMD - BCVA between 20/32 and 20/125 in at least one eye - Numerous large plaques (soft drusen) - No history of HIV, Hepatitis B or C - Elevation of certain blood factors, such as total cholesterol, fibrinogen, and IgA", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "50 Years", "maximum_age": "85 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "Accepts Healthy Volunteers", "keyword": "Rheopheresis", "mesh_term": ["Macular Degeneration"], "id": "NCT00078221"}
