{"brief_title": "Phase III Randomized Study of Lucinactant in Full Term Newborn Infants With Meconium Aspiration Syndrome", "brief_summary": "OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the safety and efficacy of lucinactant administered by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in the treatment of meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) in newborn infants.", "detailed_description": "PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive lucinactant by bronchoalveolar lavage, into the right and left lung, followed by lung drainage. Treatment repeats when patient stabilizes or every 15 minutes for 2 courses. Arm II: Patients receive standard treatment including oxygen, conventional mechanical ventilation, sedation, paralysis, vasopressors, and alkalinization. Patients are followed for 12 months.", "condition": "Meconium Aspiration", "intervention_type": "Other", "intervention_name": "Standard Care", "description": "The Standard Care (SC) group received therapies including, but not limited to, the use of oxygen, controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV), sedation, paralysis, vasopressors, and/or alkalinization.
