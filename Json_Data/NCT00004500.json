{"brief_title": "Phase III Randomized Study of Lucinactant in Full Term Newborn Infants With Meconium Aspiration Syndrome", "brief_summary": "OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the safety and efficacy of lucinactant administered by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in the treatment of meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) in newborn infants.", "detailed_description": "PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive lucinactant by bronchoalveolar lavage, into the right and left lung, followed by lung drainage. Treatment repeats when patient stabilizes or every 15 minutes for 2 courses. Arm II: Patients receive standard treatment including oxygen, conventional mechanical ventilation, sedation, paralysis, vasopressors, and alkalinization. Patients are followed for 12 months.", "condition": ["Meconium Aspiration"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Other"], "intervention_name": ["Lucinactant", "Standard Care"], "description": ["Lucinactant suspension was administered as 10 mg total phospholipid (TPL)/mL, by bronchoalveolar lavage within 90 minutes of randomization. The dose was determined based on the infant's body weight such that the total dose was 16 mL/kg for each of the 2 lavage procedures and 32 mL/kg overall. Infants received 2 doses of lucinactant. Each dose consisted of separate lavage procedures for each lung within 15 minutes (up to 60 minutes) of each other.", "The Standard Care (SC) group received therapies including, but not limited to, the use of oxygen, controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV), sedation, paralysis, vasopressors, and/or alkalinization. The use of adjunctive therapies (namely: high frequency oscillatory ventilation, high frequency jet ventilation, bolus surfactant, inhaled nitric oxide, extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation, or systemic corticosteroids) were not included in SC"], "arm_group_label": ["Lucinactant", "Standard Care"], "other_name": ["Surfactant", "KL\u2084Surfactant", "Negative Control"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Diagnosis of meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) - Continuous mechanical ventilation (CMV) at time of entry - Enrollment within 48 hours of birth - Gestational age of \u2265 37 weeks - Oxygenation index of \u2265 5 and \u2264 30 - Written informed consent signed and dated by the infant's parent(s) or legal guardian(s) Exclusion Criteria: - Congenital anomalies likely to affect any primary or secondary endpoints - Uncontrollable air leaks - Hydrops fetalis - Rupture \u2265 3 weeks of the fetal membranes - Evidence of overwhelming bacterial infection at time of randomization - Markedly labile persistent pulmonary hypertension at time of randomization - Profound neurologic manifestations - Sustained postductal SpO\u2082of < 87% for \u2265 15 minutes at an FiO\u2082of 1.00", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "48 Hours", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "rare disease", "mesh_term": ["Meconium Aspiration Syndrome", "Pulmonary Surfactants"], "id": "NCT00004500"}
