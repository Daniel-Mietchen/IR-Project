{"brief_title": "Combination Chemotherapy Followed By Antiviral Therapy and Interferon Alfa in Treating Patients With HTLV-1-Related Adult T-Cell Leukemia/Lymphoma", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Antiviral therapy may kill viruses such as HTLV-1 that can cause cancer. Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of cancer cells. Combining chemotherapy with antiviral drugs and interferon alfa may be effective in treating adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to determine the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy followed by antiviral therapy and interferon alfa in treating patients who have adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma caused by HTLV-1.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin (EPOCH) followed by lamivudine, zidovudine, and interferon alfa, in terms of response rate, in patients with HTLV-1-associated adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. - Determine the duration of response in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the effect of this regimen on markers of virus replication and expression and immune function in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive EPOCH chemotherapy comprising etoposide, vincristine, and doxorubicin IV continuously on days 1-5, cyclophosphamide IV over 30 minutes on day 5, and oral prednisone on days 1-5. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) daily beginning on day 7 and continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 21-28 days for at least 2 courses beyond best response or for up to 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, or stable disease. Beginning 1 month after completion of EPOCH, patients receive oral lamivudine and zidovudine twice daily and interferon alfa SC daily continuously for 1 year. Patients are followed monthly for 1 year, every 2 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-32 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2 years.", "condition": ["Lymphoma"], "intervention_type": ["Biological", "Biological", "Drug", "Drug", "Drug", "Drug", "Drug", "Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["filgrastim", "recombinant interferon alfa", "Etoposide", "cyclophosphamide", "doxorubicin hydrochloride", "lamivudine", "prednisone", "vincristine sulfate", "zidovudine"], "description": ["5 ug/kg/d", "9 mU subcutaneously per day for one year", "50 mg/m2/day continuous 96 hr infusion, days 1-4", "750 mg/m2 IV on day 5", "10 mg/m2/day as a continuous 96-hour infusion days 1-4", "150 mg bid", "60 mg/m2 given orally days 1-5", "0.4 mg/m2/day as a 96-hour continuous infusion days 1-4", "300 mg bid"], "other_name": ["Neupogen", "VP-16", "cytoxan", "adriamycin", "epivir", "deltasone", "Oncovin", "AZT"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically or cytologically confirmed HTLV-1-associated adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) - Previously treated ATLL allowed - CD3-positive - Documented HTLV-1 infection by serologic assay (ELISA, Western blot) - Measurable or evaluable disease PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 and over Performance status: - Karnofsky 50-100% Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - Absolute neutrophil count greater than 1,000/mm^3* - Platelet count greater than 75,000/mm^3* NOTE: *Unless cytopenia is secondary to ATLL Hepatic: - Transaminase less than 7 times upper limit of normal - Bilirubin less than 2.0 mg/dL (unless secondary to hepatic infiltration with lymphoma or isolated indirect hyperbilirubinemia associated with indinavir) Renal: - Creatinine less than 2.0 mg/dL (unless due to lymphoma) Other: - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception during and for 6 months after study completion - No active opportunistic infection requiring acute therapy - No untreated thyroid disease - No autoimmune disease - No uncontrolled significant psychiatric disease - No other concurrent malignancy except carcinoma in situ of the cervix or non-metastatic nonmelanoma skin cancer PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - At least 24 hours since prior hematologic growth factors Chemotherapy: - Not specified Endocrine therapy: - Not specified Radiotherapy: - Not specified Surgery: - Not specified Other: - Concurrent chronic therapy with potentially myelosuppressive agents allowed - Other concurrent antiretroviral therapy for HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C infection (or other indication) allowed at investigator's discretion for patients receiving therapy prior to study initiation", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "120 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "stage IV adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma", "mesh_term": ["Lymphoma", "Leukemia, T-Cell", "Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell", "Cyclophosphamide", "Liposomal doxorubicin", "Doxorubicin", "Interferons", "Prednisone", "Etoposide", "Vincristine", "Interferon-alpha", "Zidovudine", "Lamivudine"], "id": "NCT00041327"}
