{"brief_title": "Bortezomib in Treating Patients With Advanced Cancer and Kidney Dysfunction", "brief_summary": "Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of bortezomib in treating patients who have advanced cancer and kidney dysfunction. Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for cancer cell growth.", "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To identify the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of PS-341 in patients with advanced malignancy and mild, moderate or severe renal insufficiency. II. Evaluate the safety, tolerability, and the maximum tolerated dose of PS-341 for patients with varying degrees of renal insufficiency. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to most recent creatinine clearance (greater than 60 mL/min vs 40-59 mL/min vs 20-39 mL/min vs less than 20 mL/min vs any creatinine clearance and undergoing renal dialysis). Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bortezomib until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, an additional cohort of up to 12 patients is treated at the MTD. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60-69 patients (at least 12 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Adult Grade III Lymphomatoid Granulomatosis", "Adult Nasal Type Extranodal NK/T-cell Lymphoma", "Extranodal Marginal Zone B-cell Lymphoma of Mucosa-associated Lymphoid Tissue", "Nodal Marginal Zone B-cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Burkitt Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Diffuse Mixed Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Diffuse Small Cleaved Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Grade III Lymphomatoid Granulomatosis", "Recurrent Adult Immunoblastic Large Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Lymphoblastic Lymphoma", "Recurrent Grade 1 Follicular Lymphoma", "Recurrent Grade 2 Follicular Lymphoma", "Recurrent Grade 3 Follicular Lymphoma", "Recurrent Mantle Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Marginal Zone Lymphoma", "Recurrent Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma", "Refractory Multiple Myeloma", "Splenic Marginal Zone Lymphoma", "Stage III Multiple Myeloma", "Stage IV Adult Burkitt Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Diffuse Mixed Cell Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Diffuse Small Cleaved Cell Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Immunoblastic Large Cell Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Lymphoblastic Lymphoma", "Stage IV Grade 1 Follicular Lymphoma", "Stage IV Grade 2 Follicular Lymphoma", "Stage IV Grade 3 Follicular Lymphoma", "Stage IV Mantle Cell Lymphoma", "Stage IV Marginal Zone Lymphoma", "Stage IV Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma", "Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific", "Waldenstr\u00f6m Macroglobulinemia"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Other", "Other"], "intervention_name": ["bortezomib", "laboratory biomarker analysis", "pharmacological study"], "description": ["Given IV", "Correlative studies", "Correlative studies"], "arm_group_label": ["Treatment (bortezomib)", "Treatment (bortezomib)", "Treatment (bortezomib)"], "other_name": ["LDP 341", "MLN341", "VELCADE", "pharmacological studies"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Histologic proof of malignancy (including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma) - Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease;
