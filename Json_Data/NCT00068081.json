{"brief_title": "Controlled Study of NGX-4010 for the Treatment of Postherpetic Neuralgia", "brief_summary": "The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of NGX 4010 applied for 60 minutes for the treatment of PHN.", "condition": "Peripheral Nervous System Diseases", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Capsaicin Dermal Patch", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - At least 18 years of age. - Be in good health. - Diagnosis of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) made by the primary treating physician or Investigator, and at least 3 months post-vesicle crusting. - Screening Pain Sum Score of 12 to 36. - Intact, unbroken skin over the painful area(s) to be treated. - If taking chronic pain medications, be on a stable (not PRN) regimen for at least 21 days prior to Treatment Visit (Day 0) and willing to maintain medications at same stable dose(s) and schedule throughout the study. - Female subjects with child-bearing potential must have a negative serum beta hCG pregnancy test, to be performed at the Screening Visit. - All subjects must be willing to use effective methods of birth control and/or refrain from participating in a conception process during the study and for 30 days following experimental drug exposure. - Be willing and able to comply with protocol requirements for the duration of study participation. (Such requirements include, but are not limited to: completing a daily pain diary, attending all study visits, and refraining from elective surgery and extensive travel during study participation.) Exclusion Criteria: - Concomitant opioid medication, unless orally or transdermally administered and not exceeding a total daily dose of morphine 60 mg/day, or equivalent. Parenteral opioid use is excluded, regardless of dose. - Unavailability of an effective rescue medication strategy for the subject, such as unwillingness to use opioid analgesics during treatment, or high tolerance to opioids precluding the ability to relieve treatment-associated discomfort with Roxicodone\u00ae, as judged by the Investigator. - Active substance abuse or history of chronic substance abuse within the past year, or prior chronic substance abuse judged likely to recur during the study period by the investigator. - Recent use (within 21 days preceding the Treatment Visit [Day 0]) of any topically applied pain medication, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, menthol, methyl salicylate, local anesthetics (including Lidoderm\u00ae), steroids or capsaicin products on the painful areas. - Current use of any investigational agent, or Class 1 anti-arrhythmic drugs (such as tocainide and mexiletine). - Significant pain of an etiology other than PHN, for example, compression-related neuropathies (e.g., spinal stenosis) or fibromyalgia or arthritis. Subjects must not have significant ongoing pain from other cause(s) that may interfere with judging PHN-related pain. - Painful PHN areas located only on the face, above the hairline of the scalp, and/or in proximity to mucous membranes. (Investigational treatment with NGX-4010 is not allowed in these areas.) - Any implanted medical device (spinal cord stimulator, intrathecal pump or peripheral nerve stimulator) for the treatment of neuropathic pain. - Hypersensitivity to capsaicin (i.e., chili peppers or Over-the-Counter (OTC) capsaicin products), local anesthetics, Roxicodone\u00ae or adhesives. - Significant ongoing or untreated abnormalities in cardiac, renal, hepatic, or pulmonary function that may interfere either with the ability to complete the study or the evaluation of adverse events.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00068081.xml"}
