{"brief_title": "Fluorouracil, Gemcitabine, and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Cancer of the Pancreas", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known which treatment regimen is most effective for pancreatic cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of fluorouracil and gemcitabine plus radiation therapy in treating patients with cancer of the pancreas who have undergone surgery.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Compare the overall and disease-free survival of patients with resected adenocarcinoma of the pancreas treated with adjuvant fluorouracil-based chemoradiotherapy preceded and followed by fluorouracil vs gemcitabine. - Compare the local-regional and distant disease control in patients treated with these regimens. - Compare the acute and late toxic effects of these regimens in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to nodal involvement (yes vs no), tumor diameter (less than 3 cm vs 3 cm or greater), and surgical margins (negative vs positive vs unknown). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. - Arm I: Beginning 3-8 weeks after definitive surgical resection, patients receive fluorouracil IV continuously for 3 weeks. Beginning 1-2 weeks later, patients receive fluorouracil IV continuously concurrently with radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5.5 weeks. Beginning 3-5 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients receive fluorouracil IV continuously for 4 weeks every 6 weeks for 2 courses. - Arm II: Beginning 3-8 weeks after definitive surgical resection, patients receive gemcitabine IV once weekly for 3 weeks. Beginning 1-2 weeks later, patients receive chemoradiotherapy as in arm I. Beginning 3-5 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients receive gemcitabine IV once weekly for 3 weeks every 4 weeks for 3 courses. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.
