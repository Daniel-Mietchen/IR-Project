{"brief_title": "To Compare Treatment With Doxorubicin or Capecitabine for Metastatic Breast Cancer in Women 60 Years and Older", "brief_summary": "The main purpose of this study is to compare treatment with either pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or capecitabine as first line chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer in women 60 years and older.", "detailed_description": "This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), multicenter study comparing with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) with capecitabine as first line chemotherapy of metastatic breast cancer in women 60 years and older. The study consists of a screening Phase (up to 14 days prior to treatment), treatment phase (up to 1 year), and post-treatment follow-up phase. The planned duration of treatment was 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Approximately 300 patients will be enrolled and randomly assigned to receive 1 of 2 treatment groups (PLD or capecitabine). Safety evaluations will consist of vital sign examination, physical examination, incidence and severity of adverse events, and laboratory tests findings and will be followed throughout the study.", "condition": ["Metastatic Breast Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin", "Capecitabine"], "description": ["Type=exact number, unit=mg/m2, number=40, form=infusion, route=intravenous.
