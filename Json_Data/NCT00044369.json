{"brief_title": "Role of the Toxic Metal Cadmium in the Mechanism Producing Infertility With a Varicocele", "brief_summary": "Varicose veins in the scrotum (varicocele) are responsible for >20% of male infertility in the US. Varicocele are associated with decreased sperm number and markedly reduced sperm fertilizing ability. Surgical repair or removal of varicocele restores fertility in only 1/3 of cases. The goal of this study is to identify markers that predict the outcome of variocele correction. This would offer considerable health cost savings. Based on preliminary findings, we will obtain testis biopsies and semen specimens from infertile men with varicocele and prospectively examining the levels of cadmium, a toxic metal, and expression of genes required for normal sperm function. The semen and biopsies will be obtained during clinically dictated procedures. Cadmium and gene expression will be compared with response to varicocele repair (i.e., increased sperm production; pregnancy).", "condition": ["Varicocele", "Male Infertility", "Hypospermatogenesis", "Non-Obstructive Azoospermia"], "intervention_type": ["Procedure"], "intervention_name": ["Varicocele repair"], "criteria": "- Healthy male with varicocele (grades 2 [palpable] or 3 [visible, palpable]) and no other diagnosed cause for infertility - Non-smoker - Actively desiring children but never having initiated a pregnancy - Female partner having no unresolved fertility issues", "gender": "Male", "minimum_age": "21 Years", "maximum_age": "55 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "Accepts Healthy Volunteers", "keyword": "cadmium", "mesh_term": ["Infertility", "Infertility, Male", "Azoospermia", "Varicocele", "Oligospermia"], "id": "NCT00044369"}
