{"brief_title": "Neoadjuvant Docetaxel in Treating Women With Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving a chemotherapy drug before surgery may shrink the tumor so that it can be removed. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well neoadjuvant docetaxel works in treating women who are undergoing surgery for breast cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: Primary - Correlate baseline and change in apoptosis and proliferation with clinical and pathological response to neoadjuvant docetaxel followed by surgery in women with newly diagnosed breast cancer. Secondary - Correlate baseline and change in fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography uptake with clinical and pathological response in patients treated with this regimen. - Correlate baseline and change in gene expression profiles with clinical and pathological response in patients treated with this regimen. - Correlate baseline and change in tumor and serum proteomic patterns with clinical and pathological response in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a pilot study. - Neoadjuvant chemotherapy: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 and pegfilgrastim subcutaneously (SC) on day 2. Treatment repeats every 14 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Surgery: Within 2-4 weeks after the completion of 4 courses of docetaxel, patients undergo breast-conserving surgery or a mastectomy at the discretion of the treating surgeon. Patients may receive additional chemotherapy prior to surgery at the discretion of the treating physician. - Adjuvant chemotherapy: Patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy at the discretion of the treating physician. - Radiotherapy: Patients undergo radiotherapy after the completion of all chemotherapy at the discretion of the treating physician. - Hormonal therapy: Patients with estrogen- and/or progesterone-positive tumors receive hormonal therapy after the completion of chemotherapy and all local therapies at the discretion of the treating physician. Patients are followed every 6 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Breast Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Biological", "Drug", "Procedure", "Procedure"], "intervention_name": ["pegfilgrastim", "docetaxel", "conventional surgery", "neoadjuvant therapy"], "description": ["6 mg injection on day 1 of each cycle", "100 mg per meter-squared, every 14 days for 4 cycles", "lumpectomy or mastectomy at end of treatment", "treatment prior to definitive breast surgery"], "arm_group_label": ["Docetaxel", "Docetaxel", "Docetaxel", "Docetaxel"], "other_name": ["Neulasta", "Taxotere", "definitive surgery"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed infiltrating carcinoma of the breast - Unresected clinical stage T1c, T2, T3, or T4 lesion, any N - Newly diagnosed disease - Diagnostic mammogram and an ultrasound of the affected breast within 3 months before study entry - Mammogram of the contralateral breast within 6 months before study entry - Clinically measurable disease - Hormone receptor status: - Immunohistochemical staining for estrogen and progesterone and HER2/neu receptors must be obtained on initial diagnostic material PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - 18 and over Sex - Female Menopausal status - Not specified Performance status - ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy - Not specified Hematopoietic - Absolute neutrophil count at least 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 100,000/mm^3 - Hemoglobin at least 8 g/dL Hepatic - Bilirubin no greater than 1.5 times normal Renal - Creatinine no greater than 1.5 times normal Other - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception - No medical condition that would put the patient at unnecessary risk of potentially serious complications during study participation PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - Not specified Chemotherapy - No prior chemotherapy for current breast cancer Endocrine therapy - At least 1 month since prior tamoxifen or raloxifene for breast cancer prevention - No prior endocrine therapy for current breast cancer Radiotherapy - No prior radiotherapy for current breast cancer Surgery - Not specified", "gender": "Female", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "stage IV breast cancer", "mesh_term": ["Breast Neoplasms", "Docetaxel"], "id": "NCT00080626"}
