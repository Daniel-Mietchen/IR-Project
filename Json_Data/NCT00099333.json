{"brief_title": "Study of the Safety of Substituting Exenatide for Insulin in Patients Using Insulin and Oral Antidiabetic Agents", "brief_summary": "This study will look at the safety of substituting exenatide for insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes who are currently taking insulin and oral antidiabetic agent(s).", "detailed_description": "This is an exploratory, multicenter, open-label, 2-arm, parallel trial. Approximately 30 patients with type 2 diabetes, currently on a sulfonylurea, or meglitinide and/or metformin and insulin therapy, will be randomized to discontinue insulin and substitute it with exenatide or remain on their current diabetes therapy regimen. All patients will continue their current diet and exercise regimen during the study.", "condition": ["Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["exenatide", "Insulin"], "description": ["Exenatide 5 mcg subcutaneously injected twice daily for 4 weeks; then 10 mcg subcutaneously injected twice daily for 12 weeks.", "Insulin will be taken according to the subject's current regimen"], "arm_group_label": ["Exenatide", "Insulin"], "other_name": ["synthetic exendin-4", "AC2993", "Byetta"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Patients have been treated with insulin for >=3 months up to 12 years. - HbA1c <=10.5%. - Body mass index (BMI) between 27 kg/m2 and 40 kg/m2.
