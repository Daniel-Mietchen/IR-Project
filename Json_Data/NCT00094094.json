{"brief_title": "Anti-angiogenesis Agent AG-013736 in Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer", "brief_summary": "This is a Phase 2 study being conducted at multiple centers in the United States and Germany. Patients having non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (i.e., metastatic) or is locally advanced (i.e., Stage IIIB with malignant pleural effusion) are eligible to participate. Patients must have disease that has been treated with at least 1 prior treatment for metastatic disease (prior adjuvant treatment for localized disease does not count as prior treatment for metastatic disease). The purpose of the study is to test whether the angiogenesis inhibitor AG-013736 is an effective treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer as shown by the number of patients in the study who experience significant and durable tumor shrinkage", "condition": "Carcinoma, Non-small Cell Lung", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "axitinib", "description": "Axitinib (AG-013736) tablet administered orally at a dose of 5 milligrams (mg) twice daily (BID) in cycles of 4 weeks.", "arm_group_label": "Axitinib", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Histologically documented non-small cell lung cancer with metastases (Stage IV or recurrent disease) or locally advanced (Stage IIIB) with malignant pleural effusion. - At least 1 prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease (Prior adjuvant therapy for localized disease does not count as a prior therapy for metastatic disease). Exclusion Criteria: - Central lung lesions involving major blood vessels (arteries or veins). (Central lesions that maintain the structural integrity of vessels have the potential to bleed if the tumor lesion undergoes necrosis. MRI or CT angiography should be used in any case where there is any question as to whether blood vessels are involved.) - Patients with a history of Grade 2 or worse hemoptysis are not eligible. Patients with a history of Grade 1 hemoptysis within 30 days of entry are not eligible", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00094094.xml"}
