Transaminases may be <= 5.0x ULN if due to metastatic disease in the liver. - Fully recovered from prior surgery. - No history of hemorrhagic cystitis. - No microscopic hematuria (>10 RBC/hpf) unless documented to be due to an infection or non-bladder origin. - Capable of understanding the protocol requirements and risks and providing written informed consent. Exclusion Criteria: - Concurrent serious medical illness unrelated to tumor within the past 6 months. - Known chronic infectious disease, such as AIDS or hepatitis (screening for hepatitis and HIV will not be performed). - Positive screening pregnancy test or is breast-feeding. - Female or male subject of reproductive capacity who is unwilling to use methods appropriate to prevent pregnancy during the course of this study. - Receiving concurrent chemotherapy, investigational agents, radiotherapy, surgery, or has received wide field radiation within the previous 4 weeks. - History of another malignancy (except basal and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin and carcinoma in situ of the cervix) within the last 5 years. - Known or clinically suspected brain metastases. - Received more than one prior regimen of chemotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or GE junction. - Received prior neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy - Received any investigational drug within the last 30 days. - Not fully recovered from any prior, and from any reversible side effects related to the administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy, investigational agents, or radiation therapy. - Prior treatment with a camptothecin analog.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "gastric neoplasms", "mesh_term": ["Neoplasm Metastasis", "Stomach Neoplasms", "Camptothecin"], "id": "NCT00080002"}
