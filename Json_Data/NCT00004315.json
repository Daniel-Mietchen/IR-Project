{"brief_title": "Phase II Pilot Study to Compare the Bioavailability of Buffered, Enteric-Coated Ursodiol With Unmodified Ursodiol for Chronic Cholestatic Liver Disease and Cystic Fibrosis-Associated Liver Disease", "brief_summary": "OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the bioavailability of polymer-coated and buffered ursodiol (ursodeoxycholic acid) to unmodified ursodiol in patients with cystic fibrosis-associated liver disease or chronic cholestatic liver disease. II. Compare the differences in pruritus, weight gain, and liver function for both treatments.", "detailed_description": "PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients are sequentially treated with 2 formulations of ursodeoxycholic acid: unmodified ursodiol (Actigall) and buffered, enteric-coated ursodiol (Ursocarb). There is a 24-hour washout between each 4-week course of therapy.", "condition": ["Cystic Fibrosis", "Gastrointestinal Diseases", "Cholestasis"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["ursodiol"], "criteria": "PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA: --Disease Characteristics-- Chronic cholestatic liver disease Cystic fibrosis-associated liver disease --Prior/Concurrent Therapy-- Usual and customary diet maintained throughout study, e.g., medium-chain triglyceride oil --Patient Characteristics-- Pulmonary: No serious respiratory deficiency No acute illness No inability to swallow No fertile women", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "4 Months", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "rare disease", "mesh_term": ["Fibrosis", "Cystic Fibrosis", "Cholestasis", "Gastrointestinal Diseases", "Digestive System Diseases", "Ursodeoxycholic Acid"], "id": "NCT00004315"}
