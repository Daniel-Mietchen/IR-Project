{"brief_title": "VEGF Gene Transfer for Diabetic Neuropathy", "brief_summary": "This gene therapy study is being conducted to evaluate intramuscular gene transfer using VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) in patients with diabetic neuropathy in the legs. This condition causes a decrease in feeling and sensation due to diabetes. VEGF is DNA, or genetic material that is injected into the muscles of the leg. Once in the leg, it has been shown to cause new blood vessels to grow under a variety of conditions.", "condition": ["Diabetic Neuropathy"], "intervention_type": ["Biological", "Biological"], "intervention_name": ["VEGF", "VEGF"], "description": ["3 sets of injections, at 2 week intervals", "3 sets of injections, at 2 week intervals"], "arm_group_label": ["1", "2"], "criteria": "Inclusion criteria: To be eligible to enroll and remain in the study, patients must meet the following criteria: - Be at least 21 years old. - Have type I or type II diabetes mellitus and require oral anti-hyperglycemic agents or insulin. - Have peripheral neuropathy related to diabetes.
