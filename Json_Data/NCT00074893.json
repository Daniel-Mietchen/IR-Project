{"brief_title": "Protective Brace to Prevent Hand and Arm Injuries", "brief_summary": "When people use hand-held power tools, their hands and arms vibrate along with the tool they are holding. People who frequently use hand-held power tools may develop injuries related to this vibration. This study will evaluate a protective brace designed to prevent vibration-related hand and arms injuries.", "detailed_description": "Workers who use hand-held power tools absorb significant vibration energy in their arms and hands and may develop musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) such as carpal tunnel syndrome and hand-arm vibration syndrome. Protective braces may be worn to decrease the incidence of occupational MSDs. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has identified key attributes for protective braces; these attributes include vibration damping, comfort, non-interference with worker dexterity, and maintenance of safe hand temperature. Most currently available braces do not adequately address these NIOSH requirements. This study will evaluate the efficacy of a brace with piezoelectric damping material. Participants in the study will be fitted with a brace on each hand. One brace will have piezoelectric damping material and the other will be a currently available, off-the-shelf commercial brace. Hand-held joysticks and handles mounted to a vibration shaker table will be used to simulate power tool use. Participants will undergo a series of tests designed to measure hand acceleration and vibration while grasping the study joysticks and handles. The tests will take approximately 30 minutes.", "condition": ["Cumulative Trauma Disorders", "Carpal Tunnel Syndrome"], "intervention_type": ["Device"], "intervention_name": ["piezoelectric wrist brace"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Normal hand anatomy and full range of motion Exclusion Criteria: - History of significant hand or wrist arthritis - Open wounds - Prior hand or wrist surgery - Neuropathies - Skin hypersensitivity - Contact dermatitis - Reflex sympathetic dystrophy", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "21 Years", "maximum_age": "55 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "Accepts Healthy Volunteers", "keyword": "SmartWear", "mesh_term": ["Carpal Tunnel Syndrome", "Cumulative Trauma Disorders"], "id": "NCT00074893"}
