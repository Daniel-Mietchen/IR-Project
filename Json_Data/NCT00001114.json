{"brief_title": "The Safety and Effectiveness of Interferon Alfa-2B Plus Didanosine in Patients With Kaposi's Sarcoma", "brief_summary": "Primary: To evaluate the safety, toxicity, and antitumor activity of two doses of interferon alfa-2b (IFN-alpha) combined with a fixed dose of didanosine (ddI) in patients with Kaposi's sarcoma associated with HIV infection. Secondary: To evaluate the effects of combined IFN-alpha and ddI treatment on HIV expression and markers of immune function. Previous studies have shown that IFN-alpha can induce regression of Kaposi's sarcoma and suppression of HIV in some patients. Although various trials using IFN-alpha in combination with the nucleoside analogue zidovudine have demonstrated a high degree of antitumor activity and evidence of HIV suppression, the overlapping toxicity (primarily neutropenia) of these two agents has proven dose-limiting. The toxicity profile of ddI suggests that this drug may be better tolerated than zidovudine when combined with IFN-alpha.", "detailed_description": "Previous studies have shown that IFN-alpha can induce regression of Kaposi's sarcoma and suppression of HIV in some patients.

The toxicity profile of ddI suggests that this drug may be better tolerated than zidovudine when combined with IFN-alpha. Up to 90 patients are randomized to receive either low or high doses of IFN-alpha (1 or 10 million Units/day) in combination with a fixed dose of ddI. Fourteen patients are initially entered at each dose level. If no objective antitumor responses are observed among the first 14 patients at a given dose, no further patients are entered on that treatment arm. If one or more antitumor responses are seen at a given dose, up to 45 patients may be entered on that treatment arm. Patients must complete at least 4 weeks of study therapy to be considered evaluable for tumor response. Treatment is continued until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. PER AMENDMENT 9/19/96: NOTE - After 16 weeks of treatment subjects may receive any FDA approved antiretroviral drug regimen in addition to or in place of ddI.", "condition": "HIV Infections", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Didanosine", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria Concurrent Medication: Allowed: - Chemoprophylaxis for candidiasis and herpes simplex. - Up to 14 days of metronidazole. - Recombinant erythropoietin. - G-CSF (for severe cases of neutropenia). - Isoniazid for treatment of TB if given in conjunction with pyridoxine. Required in patients with CD4 counts < 200 cells/mm3: - Prophylaxis for PCP. PER AMENDMENT 9/19/96: - After the first 16 weeks of combined IFN alpha-2b and ddI treatment subjects may at the discretion of the investigator receive any FDA approved antiretroviral drug regimen in addition to or in place of ddI. Patients must have: - Positive antibody to HIV. - Biopsy-proven Kaposi's sarcoma (at least 5 measurable lesions, with at least 1 measurable cutaneous lesion) involving the skin, lymph nodes, oral cavity, or asymptomatic lesions of the GI tract not requiring systemic chemotherapy.

PER AMENDMENT 9/19/96: - Other antiretroviral agents may not be taken during the first 16 weeks of combined IFN alpha-2b and ddI treatment. Concurrent Treatment: Excluded: - Radiation therapy. Patients with the following prior conditions are excluded: - Opportunistic infection or B symptoms including unexplained fever, night sweats, weight loss > 10 percent, and diarrhea lasting more than 2 weeks. - Prior grade 3 or 4 toxicity attributed to ddI therapy. - Prior history of peripheral neuropathy (= or > grade 1), pancreatitis, intractable diarrhea, or active seizure disorder not well controlled by anti-seizure medications. - History of myocardial infarction or ventricular arrhythmias.
