{"brief_title": "Chronic Stress as a Risk Factor in the Etiology of Coronary Heart Disease", "brief_summary": "To conduct a prospective, longitudinal, analysis of the psychophysiological effects of chronic exposure to environmental stress. The study took advantage of a unique, naturally occurring experiment caused by the relocation of a major international airport.", "detailed_description": "DESIGN NARRATIVE: Studies were conducted on blood pressure and the neuroendocrine effects of noise resulting from the relocation of the Munich International Airport. At the former airport site the investigators monitored people exposed to high levels of noise and then tracked these same individuals as their ambient environment became normal following the shutdown of the airport. At the new airport site, the opposite situation occurred: Individuals living in normal, quiet ambient conditions became exposed to loud aircraft noise. At both sites, control groups were formed who were not exposed to aircraft noise. The study piggybacked onto a German sponsored grant. NIH funds covered the costs of cardiovascular and psycho-physiological data analysis. Measures included biochemical assays of chronic neuroendocrine markers of stress, resting blood pressure, and reactivity of blood pressure during cognitive tasks. Perceptions of community noise levels were also assessed as possible mediators of the stressful effects of chronic exposure to ambient, environmental noise. The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the \"End Date\" entered in the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.", "condition": ["Cardiovascular Diseases", "Coronary Disease", "Heart Diseases"], "criteria": "No eligibility criteria", "gender": "Male", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "100 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "mesh_term": ["Cardiovascular Diseases", "Heart Diseases", "Coronary Disease", "Coronary Artery Disease"], "id": "NCT00005352"}
