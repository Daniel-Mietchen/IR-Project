{"brief_title": "Reduced Immunosuppressive Therapy With or Without Donor White Blood Cells in Treating Patients With Lymphoproliferative Disease After Organ Transplantation", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Some types of lymphoproliferative disease are associated with Epstein-Barr virus. Combining reduced immunosuppressive therapy with donor white blood cells that have been treated in the laboratory to kill cells infected with Epstein-Barr virus may be an effective treatment for lymphoproliferative disease. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of reducing immunosuppressive therapy with or without donor white blood cells in treating patients who have Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative disease after organ transplantation.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of treatment with partially HLA-matched allogeneic cytotoxic T cells and reduction of immunosuppression, in terms of survival rate and time to remission in patients with Epstein-Barr virus-associated B-cell lymphoproliferative disease after solid organ transplantation. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to transplanted organ type and transplant center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients undergo sliding-scale reduction of immunosuppressive drugs from 1 of 5 regimens at physician's discretion. Patients then receive partially HLA-matched allogeneic cytotoxic T cells IV over 5 minutes once weekly for a total of 4 weeks. - Arm II: Patients undergo reduction of immunosuppression as in arm I alone. Patients are followed monthly for 6 months and then every 3 months for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Lymphoproliferative Disorder"], "intervention_type": ["Biological"], "intervention_name": ["therapeutic allogeneic lymphocytes"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Diagnosis of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) after solid organ (heart, heart/lung, liver, liver/gut, pancreas, or kidney) transplantation - Epstein-Barr virus-positive tumor - Newly diagnosed disease - Measurable disease by clinical methods or radiography - Must have partially matched donor cytotoxic T cells (CTL) available - No known panel reactivity to any of the HLA types of CTL available for therapy PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - Any age Performance status: - Karnofsky 20-100% Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - Not specified Hepatic: - Not specified Renal: - Not specified Other: - Not pregnant PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - Not specified Chemotherapy: - Not specified Endocrine therapy: - Not specified Radiotherapy: - Not specified Surgery: - Not specified Other: - No prior therapy for PTLD - No concurrent antiviral drugs (e.g., acyclovir or ganciclovir) for PTLD", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder", "mesh_term": ["Lymphoproliferative Disorders"], "id": "NCT00033475"}
