{"brief_title": "Erlotinib Hydrochloride and Bevacizumab in Treating Patients With Stage IV Breast Cancer", "brief_summary": "This phase II trial studies how well erlotinib hydrochloride and bevacizumab work in treating patients with stage IV breast cancer. Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving erlotinib hydrochloride and bevacizumab may be an effective treatment for breast cancer.", "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the efficacy of bevacizumab in combination with OSI-774 (erlotinib hydrochloride) in patients with previously treated metastatic breast cancer, as measured by objective response rate. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the toxicity of bevacizumab in combination with OSI-774 in patients with previously treated metastatic breast cancer. II. To evaluate the efficacy of bevacizumab in combination with OSI-774 in patients with previously treated metastatic breast cancer, as measured by time to disease progression, duration of response and the proportion of patients with stabilization of disease >= 6 months. III. To determine the molecular profile of the patient's primary breast tumor, and to explore the relationship between these molecular characteristics and the response to treatment. IV. To explore changes in biological markers in pre- and post-treatment tumor tissue in a subset of patients with accessible sites of disease. V. To explore a pre- and post-treatment analysis of circulating endothelial cells and the relationship of this analysis to serum markers of angiogenesis as well as response to treatment. VI. To obtain serial measurements of circulating epithelial cells and explore the relationship of these cells with circulating endothelial cells, markers of angiogenesis, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression. OUTLINE: Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.", "condition": ["Recurrent Breast Carcinoma", "Stage IV Breast Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Biological", "Drug", "Other"], "intervention_name": ["Bevacizumab", "Erlotinib Hydrochloride", "Laboratory Biomarker Analysis"], "description": ["Given IV", "Given PO", "Correlative studies"], "arm_group_label": ["Treatment (erlotinib hydrochloride, bevacizumab)", "Treatment (erlotinib hydrochloride, bevacizumab)", "Treatment (erlotinib hydrochloride, bevacizumab)"], "other_name": ["Anti-VEGF", "Anti-VEGF Humanized Monoclonal Antibody", "Anti-VEGF rhuMAb", "Avastin", "Bevacizumab Biosimilar BEVZ92", "Bevacizumab Biosimilar BI 695502", "Immunoglobulin G1 (Human-Mouse Monoclonal rhuMab-VEGF Gamma-Chain Anti-Human Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor), Disulfide With Human-Mouse Monoclonal rhuMab-VEGF Light Chain, Dimer", "Recombinant Humanized Anti-VEGF Monoclonal Antibody", "rhuMab-VEGF", "Cp-358,774", "OSI-774", "Tarceva"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed carcinoma of the breast with metastatic (stage IV) disease that is currently stable or progressing after therapy - Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >= 20 mm with conventional techniques or as >= 10 mm with spiral computed tomography (CT) scan - Patients must have either stable disease or disease progression on or after therapy with one or two conventional chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of metastatic (stage IV) breast cancer - Prior treatment with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell/bone marrow transplantation is allowed, and is considered one prior regimen when administered for metastatic disease - There is no restriction for the number of prior hormonal therapies or immunotherapies - If human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2)/neu-positive (defined as 3+ by immunohistochemistry [IHC] or positive by fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH]), prior therapy with trastuzumab required - Any number of prior regimens of chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy are allowed in the adjuvant setting, and do not count towards prior therapy when determining eligibility for this trial - Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =< 2 (Karnofsky >= 60%) - Life expectancy of greater than 3 months - Leukocytes >= 3,000/ul - Absolute neutrophil count >= 1,000/ul - Platelets >= 75,000/ul - Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits - Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT[) =< 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal - Creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance >= 60 mL/min for patients with creatinine levels outside institutional normal using the Cockcroft-Gault formula - Women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (barrier method of birth control) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation;
