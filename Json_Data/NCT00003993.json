{"brief_title": "Bryostatin 1 and Interleukin-2 in Treating Patients With Refractory Solid Tumors or Lymphoma", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill cancer cells. Combining chemotherapy and interleukin-2 may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of interleukin-2 when given together with bryostatin 1 in treating patients with refractory solid tumors or lymphoma.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety and side effects of bryostatin 1 and interleukin-2 in patients with refractory solid tumors or lymphomas. - Determine the maximum tolerated dose for interleukin-2 with bryostatin 1 in these patients. - Determine whether bryostatin 1 and interleukin-2 increase the expression of recognition and costimulatory molecules on human monocytes and their ability to act as antigen presenting cells. - Assess any anti-tumor response in these patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of interleukin-2. Patients receive bryostatin 1 IV over 24 hours on days 1 and 8, and interleukin-2 subcutaneously on days 1-5 and days 8-12. Treatment continues every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of interleukin-2 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-24 patients will be accrued for this study in less than 2 years.", "condition": ["Lymphoma", "Small Intestine Cancer", "Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific"], "intervention_type": ["Biological", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["aldesleukin", "bryostatin 1"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically proven solid tumor or lymphoma that is not curable by surgery, radiotherapy, or standard chemotherapy, or for which no curative therapy exists - Prostate cancer patients must have the following: - Tumor progression following blockade of both testicular and adrenal androgens - Serum testosterone in the castrate range (less than 20 ng/mL) - At least 3 months since prior suramin therapy - At least 4 weeks since prior flutamide or other antiandrogen medication and no evidence of response to treatment - Luprolide should continue if no prior orchiectomy - No prior or concurrent brain metastases PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 and over Performance status: - ECOG 0 or 1 Life expectancy: - At least 3 months Hematopoietic: - WBC at least 3,500/mm^3 OR - Granulocyte count at least 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 100,000/mm^3 - Hemoglobin at least 8 g/dL Hepatic: - Hepatitis B surface antigen negative - PT no greater than 14 seconds - PTT no greater than 35 seconds - Bilirubin no greater than 1.5 mg/dL unless due to Gilbert's disease - SGOT and SGPT no greater than 2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) - Alkaline phosphatase no greater than 2.5 times ULN - Albumin at least 2.5 g/dL Renal: - Creatinine no greater than 1.5 mg/dL OR - Creatinine clearance at least 50 mL/min - Corrected calcium at least 8.0 mg/dL, but no greater than 10.7 mg/dL Cardiovascular: - No prior myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure, second or third degree AV block, or cardiac arrhythmias requiring treatment - No evidence of CAD on EKG Pulmonary: - FEV1-1 at least 70% predicted - DLCO at least 60% predicted Other: - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception - HIV negative - At least 1 week since active infection requiring antibiotics - No other medical or psychiatric condition that would preclude study - No prior or concurrent seizure disorders controlled with medication PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - At least 4 weeks since prior interleukin-2 - At least 4 weeks since other prior biologic therapy for solid tumors or lymphomas Chemotherapy: - See Disease Characteristics - At least 4 weeks since prior bryostatin 1 - At least 4 weeks since other prior chemotherapy for solid tumors or lymphomas Endocrine therapy: - See Disease Characteristics - At least 4 weeks since other prior endocrine therapy for solid tumors or lymphomas - No absolute requirement for corticosteroids Radiotherapy: - See Disease Characteristics - At least 4 weeks since prior radiotherapy for solid tumors or lymphomas Surgery: - See Disease Characteristics - At least 4 weeks since prior surgery for solid tumors or lymphomas Other: - No absolute requirement for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or H2 blockers", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "splenic marginal zone lymphoma", "mesh_term": ["Lymphoma", "Intestinal Neoplasms", "Aldesleukin", "Bryostatin 1", "Interleukin-2"], "id": "NCT00003993"}
