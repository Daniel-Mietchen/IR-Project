{"brief_title": "S0217, Adjuvant Cisplatin and Docetaxel After Complete Resection Stage III or IV Head and Neck Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and docetaxel, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Cisplatin and docetaxel may make the tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Giving chemoradiotherapy after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well adjuvant chemoradiotherapy using cisplatin and docetaxel works in treating patients with completely resected stage III or stage IV head and neck cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the disease-free survival and overall survival of patients with high-risk stage III or IV squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated with adjuvant chemoradiotherapy comprising docetaxel and cisplatin. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Categorize the site(s) of disease relapse in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36 and cisplatin IV over 1.5 hours on days 1, 22, and 43. Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, 36-40, and 43-45. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression and then every 6 months for up to 3 years from registration. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 70 patients will be accrued for this study within 17.5-23.5 months.", "condition": "Head and Neck Cancer", "intervention_type": "Radiation", "intervention_name": "radiation therapy", "description": "200 cGy/day, Days 1-5, q week for 6 weeks", "arm_group_label": "chemoRT after surgery", "other_name": "RT", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck - Selected stage III or IV (no distant metastasis) disease - The following TNM stages are excluded: - T3, N0, M0 - T4a, N0, M0 - T4b, N3, M0 - Any T, any N, M1 - Complete total resection within the past 56 days AND has one or more of the following risk factors: - Multiple pathologically confirmed lymph node metastases - One or more lymph nodes with extracapsular extension of tumor - Microscopically positive margin(s) of resection, including mucosal margins and/or soft tissue or deep margins of resection - No primary nasopharyngeal carcinoma PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - 18 and over Performance status - Zubrod 0-1 Life expectancy - Not specified Hematopoietic - Absolute neutrophil count \u2265 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count \u2265 100,000/mm^3 - Hemoglobin \u2265 8.0 g/dL Hepatic - Bilirubin \u2264 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) - SGOT or SGPT \u2264 1.5 times ULN - Alkaline phosphatase \u2264 2.5 times ULN Renal - Creatinine \u2264 1.5 mg/dL OR - Creatinine clearance \u2265 60 mL/min Other - No pre-existing peripheral neuropathy - No known history of severe hypersensitiviy reaction to products containing Polysorbate 80 - No other malignancy within the past 5 years except adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or adequately treated stage I or II cancer currently in complete remission - Not pregnant or nursing - Fertile patients must use effective contraception PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - Not specified Chemotherapy - No prior chemotherapy for the malignancy Endocrine therapy - Not specified Radiotherapy - No prior radiotherapy for the malignancy Surgery - See Disease Characteristics Other - No concurrent amifostine", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00084435.xml"}
