{"brief_title": "EF5 Prior to Surgery or Biopsy in Patients With Breast, Prostate, or Cervical Cancer or High Grade Soft Tissue Sarcoma", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: EF5 may detect the presence of oxygen in tumor cells and help plan effective cancer treatment. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of EF5 in detecting the presence of oxygen in tumor cells of patients who are undergoing surgery or biopsy for breast, prostate, or cervical cancer or high grade soft tissue sarcoma.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the optimal dose of etanidazole derivative EF5 that is safely tolerated and provides optimal binding in resected tumor specimens or tumor biopsies in patients with breast, head and neck, prostate, or cervical carcinoma or high grade soft tissue sarcomas. II. Define the toxic effects of EF5 in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive etanidazole derivative EF5 IV over 1-2 hours. Approximately 24-48 hours after EF5 treatment, patients undergo surgical resection or biopsy of tumor. Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of EF5 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or optimal dose is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. The optimal dose is defined as the dose level at or preceding the MTD and resulting in optimal tumor-to-normal-tissue binding. Patients are followed at 28 days. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-36 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18 months.", "condition": ["Breast Cancer", "Cervical Cancer", "Head and Neck Cancer", "Prostate Cancer", "Sarcoma"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Other", "Other", "Other", "Procedure"], "intervention_name": ["EF5", "flow cytometry", "fluorescent antibody technique", "immunohistochemistry staining method", "biopsy"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically proven breast, head and neck, prostate, or cervical carcinoma or high grade (defined as grades 2 or 3) soft tissue sarcoma Sarcoma tumors must be confined to truncal or extremity locations Must have a clinical condition and physiologic status which demonstrates that the appropriate or standard initial therapy for the tumor is surgical biopsy or resection Tumors no greater than 15 cm in any diameter Hormone receptor status: Not specified PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: 18 and over Menopausal status: Not specified Performance status: ECOG 0 or 1 Life expectancy: Not specified Hematopoietic: Absolute neutrophil count greater than 2,000/mm3 Platelet count greater than 100,000/mm3 Hepatic: Bilirubin less than 2.0 mg/dL Renal: Creatinine less than 2.0 mg/dL OR Creatinine clearance greater than 50 mL/min Cardiovascular: No significant cardiac disease that would preclude the safe use of general anesthesia Pulmonary: No significant pulmonary disease that would preclude the safe use of general anesthesia Other: Not pregnant or nursing Negative pregnancy test Fertile patients must use effective contraception during and for 1 month after study No grade 3 or 4 peripheral neuropathy PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: Not specified Chemotherapy: Not specified Endocrine therapy: Not specified Radiotherapy: Not specified Surgery: See Disease Characteristics", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "120 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "stage I adult soft tissue sarcoma", "mesh_term": ["Breast Neoplasms", "Prostatic Neoplasms", "Sarcoma", "Head and Neck Neoplasms", "Uterine Cervical Neoplasms", "Antibodies"], "id": "NCT00004261"}
