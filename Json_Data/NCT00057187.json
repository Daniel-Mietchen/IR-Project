Objectives: The objectives of the study were: 1) to compare the effectiveness of an aftercare intervention consisting of a participation contract, attendance prompts, and attendance reinforcers (CPR) to a standard treatment (STX) on adherence to therapy; and 2) to assess the effects of this intervention on treatment outcome Methods: We recruited 150 veterans from the Salem VAMC\ufffds SARRTP who could participate in aftercare. Our population is similar to those in other VA\ufffds (97% male, 54% Caucasian, 46% minority, 49 years mean age, 44% alcohol dependent only, 56% drug dependent, and 44% with a dual diagnosis). In this randomized clinical trial, treatment adherence and outcome were measured at baseline and 3-, 6- and 12-months after participants entered treatment using interviews, questionnaires, alcohol and drug screens, VA medical records, and therapist ratings. The study design is a repeated measures nested cohort design, with an intervention and a standard care group. The primary outcome, abstinence rate, will be analyzed using a logistic regression model in which the parameters of interest are estimated using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE). Status: Participant recruitment and follow-up interviews were completed in June 2003 and August 2004, respectively. The HSR&D final report was submitted in April 2005. The main results paper and additional papers will be submitted for publication in 2005.", "condition": ["Substance Dependence", "Compliance", "Treatment Outcome"], "intervention_type": ["Behavioral"], "intervention_name": ["Contracting, Prompting and Reinforcing"], "arm_group_label": ["Arm 1"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: All graduates of the Salem VA's SARRTP who: live within a 60 minute drive of the Salem VAMC, or 1 of our 5 SARRTP outreach clinics; have transportation and a job schedule that allows them to attend outpatient aftercare therapy.
