{"brief_title": "Cisplatin and Radiation Therapy With or Without Hyperthermia Therapy in Treating Patients With Cervical Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Hyperthermia therapy kills tumor cells by heating them to several degrees above body temperature. It is not yet known whether chemotherapy and radiation therapy are more effective with or without hyperthermia therapy in treating cervical cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial compared the safety and efficacy of cisplatin and radiation therapy, together with hyperthermia therapy versus cisplatin and radiation therapy alone in the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: Compare local control, failure-free survival, and overall survival of patients with locally advanced carcinoma of the cervix treated with cisplatin and radiotherapy alone, versus cisplatin and radiotherapy with hyperthermia . OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to participating center, disease stage (IIB or IIIA vs IIIB or IVA) and age (< 60 years vs \u2265 60 years). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. LIMITATIONS: There are integrity issues with the currently available data, involving international institutions, in that several pieces of information relating to patient accrual and outcomes cannot be verified. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to report outcome measures for this study. Baseline measures of age and gender are reported for the entire study cohort. Participant flow is reported by treatment arm assignment, which was available for a majority of patients in the currently available data. Adverse events are reported for the entire cohort, as some adverse events could not be classified within a particular treatment arm.", "condition": "Cervical Cancer", "intervention_type": "Radiation", "intervention_name": "external beam radiation therapy", "description": "Patients undergo external beam radiation therapy once daily on days 1-5", "arm_group_label": "Arm II", "other_name": "Platinol-AQ", "criteria": "Inclusion criteria: Invasive cervical carcinoma (squamous, adeno or adenosquamous histologies, small cell histology excluded) - age >18years - International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics ((FIGO) stage IB2, IIA-IVA, FIGO stages IA, IB1 with positive pelvic lymph nodes or parametria either on imaging techniques or pathologically involved at the time of surgery. patients undergoing surgical removal of the cervix and uterus are not eligible, parametria either on imaging techniques or pathologically involved at the time \u2022 Performance status Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group(ECOG)/World Health Organisation (WHO) 0, 1 or >/=70%respectively White Blood count (WBC) \u2265 3,000, platelets \u2265 100,000, Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) > 1500 \u2022 serum bilirubin \u2264 1.5 times upper limit of normal, transaminase \u2264 3 times upper limit of normal calculated creatinine clearance >60milliliters (mls)/liter ( Cockcroft) OR creatinine </= 2.0mgs% paraaortic adenopathy absent or 1.5 centimeter (cm) in greatest dimension on Computerised Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan; No history of myocardial infarction in the last 6 months no symptomatic angina pectoris negative pregnancy test in patients under 50 Hemoglobin >12.0 Gd/dl or >7.5 mmo;/L with transfusion if needed written written informed consent Exclusion criteria: surgical resection of the primary tumor (i.e. Total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH)/ Bilateral salpingoophorectomy (BSO) - patients with pacemakers or implanted defibrillators - patients with significant metallic foreign bodies (i.e. hip replacements, bone metallic rods,orthopedic plates, etc.) - prior radiotherapy or chemotherapy", "gender": "Female", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00085631.xml"}
