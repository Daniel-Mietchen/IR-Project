{"brief_title": "Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a peptide may make the body build an immune response and kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy in treating patients who have metastatic cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine whether an immunologic response can be obtained in HLA*0201-expressing patients with metastatic cancer treated with telomerase: 540-548 peptide vaccine emulsified in Montanide ISA-51. - Determine which vaccine strategy (frequency, schedule, and dosing) is best for future studies in these patients. - Determine the toxicity of this treatment in these patients. - Determine whether prior immunization with telomerase: 540-548 peptide vaccine results in increased clinical response to interleukin-2 in patients with melanoma. OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to disease (metastatic cutaneous melanoma vs other tumor types). Patients are randomized to one of three treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive telomerase: 540-548 peptide vaccine emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously (SC) on day 1 of weeks 1-4 and 7-10. Patients also undergo leukapheresis over 3 hours at baseline and after each course of treatment. - Arm II: Patients receive telomerase: 540-548 peptide vaccine emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 SC on day 1 of weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10. Patients also undergo leukapheresis over 3 hours at baseline, after the vaccine on week 4, and after each course of treatment. - Arm III: Patients receive telomerase: 540-548 peptide vaccine emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 SC on days 1-4 of weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10. Patients undergo leukapheresis as in arm II. Treatment in all arms repeats every 13 weeks for 4-6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with a complete response (CR) receive 1 additional course of treatment after achieving CR. Eligible melanoma patients with progressive disease on vaccine alone on any of the 3 arms may receive interleukin-2 (IL-2) combined with vaccine as in arm II. Beginning the day after each immunization, IL-2 is administered IV over 15 minutes every 8 hours over 4 days on weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10 for a maximum of 12 doses. Patients continuing to experience disease progression on combined vaccine and IL-2 therapy go off study after 2 courses of combined therapy. Patients are followed at 3 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 90-162 patients (30-54 per treatment arm; 45-81 per stratum) will be accrued for this study within less than 2 years.", "condition": "Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific", "intervention_type": "Biological", "intervention_name": "telomerase: 540-548 peptide vaccine", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Presenting with evaluable metastatic cancer - Refractory to standard treatment OR - Post-radiation for malignant glioma - HLA-A*0201 expression PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 16 and over Performance status: - ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy: - More than 3 months Hematopoietic: - WBC at least 3,000/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 90,000/mm^3 Hepatic: - Bilirubin no greater than 1.6 mg/dL - AST/ALT less than 3 times normal - Hepatitis B surface antigen negative Renal: - Creatinine no greater than 2.0 mg/dL Cardiovascular: - No cardiac ischemia by stress thallium or comparable test* - No prior myocardial infarction* - No cardiac arrhythmias* NOTE: *Patients receiving interleukin-2 (IL-2) only Pulmonary: - No obstructive or restrictive pulmonary disease (patients receiving IL-2 only) Immunologic: - HIV negative - No autoimmune disease or any other known immunodeficiency disease - No active primary or secondary immunodeficiency Other: - No other active major medical illness* - No active systemic infection - Not pregnant - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception NOTE: *Patients receiving IL-2 only PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - No prior telomerase: 540-548 peptide immunization Chemotherapy: - Recovered from prior chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: - No requirement for systemic steroid therapy Radiotherapy: - See Disease Characteristics - Recovered from prior radiotherapy Surgery: - Not specified Other: - At least 3 weeks since prior systemic therapy for cancer", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "16 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00021164.xml"}
