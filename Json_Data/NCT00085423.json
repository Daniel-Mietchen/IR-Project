{"brief_title": "Cyclophosphamide, Fludarabine, and High-Dose Interleukin-2 in Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill tumor cells and may help a person's immune system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving cyclophosphamide and fludarabine together with high-dose interleukin-2 works in treating patients with metastatic melanoma.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the objective response rate in lymphodepleted patients with metastatic melanoma treated with cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, and high-dose interleukin-2. - Determine the feasibility of this regimen in these patients. Secondary - Determine the quality and quantity of lymphocyte recovery in these patients during and after treatment with this regimen. - Determine time to disease progression and survival in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients receive lymphodepleting therapy comprising cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 2 and fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days 3-7. Patients then receive high-dose interleukin-2 IV every 8 hours (14 doses) on days 8-12 and 22-26. Patients also receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously beginning on day 8 and continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-33 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Melanoma (Skin)"], "intervention_type": ["Biological", "Biological", "Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["aldesleukin", "sargramostim", "cyclophosphamide", "fludarabine phosphate"], "description": ["\u2021Interleukin-2 (aldesleukin) IV (600,000 U/kg; Chiron, Emeryville, CA): two 5-day courses on days 8 and 22.
