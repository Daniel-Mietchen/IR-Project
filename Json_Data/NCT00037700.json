{"brief_title": "Evaluation of the Efficacy of Combination Treatment With Anakinra and Pegsunercept in Improving Rheumatoid Arthritis", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of anakinra (IL-1 ra) and pegsunercept (PEG sTNF-RI) when they are used together in improving the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. The study will also evaluate the safety of the combination treatment and its effect on slowing down bone and joint destruction due to rheumatoid arthritis. The results will be compared to the effect when only 1 single medication (anakinra or pegsunercept) is used.", "condition": ["Rheumatoid Arthritis"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["anakinra", "pegsunercept"], "criteria": "- diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis for at least 6 months - must be taking methotrexate * must not take DMARDS other than methotrexate during the study - must not have had previous treatment with and protein-based TNF-alpha inhibitor (eg. etanercept, infliximab, PEG sTNF-RI, or D2E7) - must not have had previous treatment with anakinra - subjects must meet tender and swollen joint requirements at screening, have morning stiffness, and/or have elevated acute phase reactants", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "mesh_term": ["Arthritis", "Arthritis, Rheumatoid", "Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein"], "id": "NCT00037700"}
