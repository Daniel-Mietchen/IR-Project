{"brief_title": "ARIES - Ambrisentan in Patients With Moderate to Severe Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH)", "brief_summary": "The primary objective is to determine the effect of ambrisentan on exercise capacity in subjects with PAH.", "detailed_description": "ARIES-1 in North America and Australia ARIES-2 in Western and Eastern Europe, South America and Israel Subjects in these randomized studies will receive one of two doses of ambrisentan or placebo. Inclusion is not based on a specified WHO functional classification. Rather, subjects with WHO Class I-IV symptoms are eligible if their 6-minute walk distance is 150-450 meters and they meet the study-specified hemodynamic criteria. Subjects with anorexigen or HIV infection related PAH are eligible but subjects with congenital heart disease and pediatric subjects are excluded. The study requires a historical cardiac catheterization and other diagnostic procedures.", "condition": ["Pulmonary Hypertension"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Ambrisentan"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Diagnosis of idiopathic PAH (formally known as PPH), or PAH associated with collagen vascular disease, anorexigen use, or HIV infection; - Historical cardiac catheterization with the following hemodynamic criteria: Mean pulmonary artery pressure greater than or equal to 25 mmHg; Pulmonary vascular resistance greater than 3 mmHg/L/min; Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure or left ventricular end diastolic pressure less than 15 mmHg; - 6-minute walk distance of at least 150 meters, but no more than 450 meters; - Total lung capacity greater than or equal to 70% and FEV1 greater than or equal to 65% of predicted normal; Exclusion Criteria: - Portopulmonary hypertension; - Subjects with PAH due to or associated with coronary artery disease, left heart disease, interstitial lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, veno-occlusive disease, chronic thromboembolic disease, or sleep apnea; - Bosentan (Tracleer\u00ae), sildenafil (Viagra\u00ae), or chronic prostanoid therapy within 4 weeks of screening; - Serum ALT or AST lab value that is greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal; - Contraindication to treatment with an endothelin receptor antagonist; - Subject with cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, hematologic, gastrointestinal, immunologic, endocrine, metabolic, or central nervous system disease that may adversely affect the safety of the subject; - Participation in a clinical study involving another investigational drug within 4 weeks of screening.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension", "mesh_term": ["Hypertension", "Hypertension, Pulmonary", "Familial Primary Pulmonary Hypertension"], "id": "NCT00091598"}
