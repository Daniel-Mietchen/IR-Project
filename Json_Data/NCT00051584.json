{"brief_title": "Safety/Efficacy Study of SGN-15 (Antibody-Drug Conjugate) Combined With Gemcitabine in Patients With Ovarian Cancer", "brief_summary": "This is an open-label, randomized phase II trial comparing treatment with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) drug immunoconjugate, SGN-15, administered weekly in combination with weekly Gemzar\u00ae (Gemcitabine) to treatment with Gemzar\u00ae alone. The primary objectives of this study are to determine the toxicity and safety profile of the combination of SGN-15 and Gemzar\u00ae, to estimate the clinical response rate and to estimate the duration of response of this combination therapy administered to patients with advanced ovarian cancer, compared to treatment with Gemzar\u00ae alone.", "condition": ["Ovarian Neoplasms"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["SGN-15 (cBR96-Doxorubicin Immunoconjugate)", "Gemzar (Gemcitabine)"], "criteria": "Brief Overview of Inclusion Criteria: - Patients must have pathologically confirmed ovarian cancer, which is advanced or recurrent carcinoma, who have failed at least two, but no more than three prior therapies for metastatic disease - Patients must have > 20% Lewis-y antigen expression documented by immunohistochemistry - LVEF > 50% by echo or MUGA - Must be platinum resistant as defined by: - Progression while on initial platinum therapy or - Progression while on retreatment with initial platinum regimen or - Relapse < 6 months after initial therapy Brief Overview of Exclusion Criteria: - Patients who have had prior therapy with Gemzar\u00ae - Cumulative anthracycline exposure > 300 mg/m2 - More than three prior chemotherapy regimens for ovarian cancer (Retreatment with Taxane/Platinum after initial combination is considered only one regimen)", "gender": "Female", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "mesh_term": ["Ovarian Neoplasms", "Gemcitabine", "Doxorubicin", "Liposomal doxorubicin", "Antibodies, Monoclonal", "Immunoconjugates"], "id": "NCT00051584"}
