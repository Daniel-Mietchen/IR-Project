{"brief_title": "CP4071 in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Soft Tissue Sarcoma", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of CP4071 in treating patients who have locally advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy, in terms of response rate, of CP4071 in patients with previously treated, locally advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma. - Determine the clinical toxic effects of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral CP4071 daily. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
