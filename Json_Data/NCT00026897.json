{"brief_title": "Trafficking of Indium-III-Labeled Cultured Immune Cells in Patients Undergoing Immunotherapy for Advanced Cancer", "brief_summary": "Patients undergoing immunotherapy for advanced cancer under IRB-approved protocols, who are to receive immune cells in adoptive transfer, will have less than or equal to 50% of those cells labeled with In-111-oxine and administered along with the remainder of their unlabeled cells. They will then undergo gamma-camera imaging over the next 0-7 days and blood samples and tumor sites which are accessible with minimal surgery (low-risk biopsy) may be sampled in some patients for enumeration of radiolabeled cells. End-points will be tumor and normal organ imaging and the amount of In-111 per gram of tissue in biopsies or per ml. of blood.", "detailed_description": "Patients undergoing immunotherapy for advanced cancer under IRB-approved protocols, who are to receive immune cells in adoptive transfer, will have less than or equal to 50% of those cells labeled with In-111-oxine and administered along with the remainder of their unlabeled cells.
