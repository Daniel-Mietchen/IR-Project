{"brief_title": "Thalidomide in Treating Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome", "brief_summary": "Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of thalidomide in treating patients who have myelodysplastic syndrome. Thalidomide may improve the immune system's ability to fight myelodysplastic syndrome", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether thalidomide improves cytopenias in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine whether this regimen down regulates the peripheral blood levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma, and interleukin-12 and whether these changes correlate with clinical response in these patients. IV. Determine whether this regimen alters the peripheral blood T-cell subset distribution and whether these changes correlate with clinical response in these patients. V. Determine the effect of this regimen on bone marrow microvessel density and whether these effects correlate with clinical response in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prognosis (favorable vs unfavorable). (Favorable stratum closed to accrual 12/28/01) Patients receive oral thalidomide once daily. Treatment continues for 5 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 months for 1 year and then annually for 4 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-58 patients (10-29 per stratum) will be accrued for this study within 20 months.
