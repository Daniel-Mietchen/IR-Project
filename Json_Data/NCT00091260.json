{"brief_title": "CC-5013 With or Without Dexamethasone in Treating Patients With Primary Systemic Amyloidosis", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs such as CC-5013 and dexamethasone may be effective in treating primary systemic amyloidosis. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying CC-5013 to see how well it works with or without dexamethasone in treating patients with primary systemic amyloidosis.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the tolerability of CC-5013 in patients with primary systemic (AL) amyloidosis. - Determine the objective hematologic response rate in patients treated with this drug. - Determine amyloid organ disease response in patients treated with this drug. Secondary - Determine hematologic and amyloid organ disease response in patients who do not achieve a response to CC-5013 alone and are subsequently treated with CC-5013 and dexamethasone. - Determine the toxicity of CC-5013 in combination with dexamethasone in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral CC-5013 once daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients not achieving a hematologic response continue to receive CC-5013 as before and also receive oral dexamethasone twice daily on days 1-4, 9-12, and 17-20 of every other 28-day course for up to 6 courses of combination therapy. Patients who maintain a hematologic response after 6 courses of combination therapy may receive CC-5013 alone in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients not achieving a hematologic response after the initiation of dexamethasone are removed from the study. Patients are followed annually. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 5-12.5 months.", "condition": ["Multiple Myeloma"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["dexamethasone", "lenalidomide"], "description": ["dexamethasone 20 mg daily (10 mg BID) on Days 1-4, 9-12, and 17-20 of every other 28-day cycle.", "15 mg/day, for 21 days with 7 days rest (28 day cycle) with or without dexamethasone"], "arm_group_label": ["revlimid", "revlimid"], "other_name": ["dexamethasone acetate", "revlimid; CC-5013"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed primary systemic (AL) amyloidosis - Tissue amyloid deposits or positive fat aspirate - Meets 1 of the following criteria for AL type disease: - Serum or urine monoclonal protein by immunofixation electrophoresis - Plasmacytosis of bone marrow by monoclonal staining for kappa- or lambda-light chain isotype PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - 18 and over Performance status - SWOG 0-2 Life expectancy - Not specified Hematopoietic - White blood count> 3,000/mm^3 - Hemoglobin > 8 g/dL - Platelet count > 100,000/mm^3 - Absolute neutrophil count > 1,000/mm^3 Hepatic - Bilirubin \u2264 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) - aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) \u2264 2 times ULN PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - Prior thalidomide for AL amyloidosis allowed Chemotherapy - More than 4 weeks since prior cytotoxic chemotherapy Endocrine therapy - Prior steroids for AL amyloidosis allowed Radiotherapy - More than 4 weeks since prior radiotherapy Surgery - Prior surgery allowed Other - Recovered from all prior therapy Exclusion Criteria: - No secondary or familial amyloidosis - No multiple myeloma, defined as \u2265 30% plasma cells in bone marrow biopsy specimen OR lytic bone lesions - No prior CC-5013 Renal - No dialysis Cardiovascular - No symptomatic cardiac arrhythmia - No oxygen-dependent restrictive cardiomyopathy Other - No untreated or uncontrolled infection - No other malignancy except basal cell skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast - No other serious medical illness that would preclude study participation - No history of hypersensitivity reaction to thalidomide - HIV negative - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "primary systemic amyloidosis", "mesh_term": ["Multiple Myeloma", "Amyloidosis", "Dexamethasone acetate", "Dexamethasone", "Dexamethasone 21-phosphate", "Lenalidomide", "BB 1101"], "id": "NCT00091260"}
