{"brief_title": "Imatinib Mesylate in Treating Patients With HIV-Related Kaposi's Sarcoma", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well imatinib mesylate works in treating patients with HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine clinical response in patients with HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma treated with imatinib mesylate. Secondary - Determine the inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor receptors, as determined by immunohistochemistry, in patients treated with this drug. - Determine cytokine profiles before and after treatment with this drug in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of this drug and antiretrovirals in these patients. - Determine mechanisms of primary and secondary resistance to this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once daily. Treatment continues for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 30 days. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.", "condition": ["Sarcoma"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["imatinib mesylate"], "description": ["400 mg orally once a day for up to 6 months."], "arm_group_label": ["Imatinib mesylate"], "other_name": ["Gleevec"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) involving at least 1 of the following areas: - Skin - Lymph nodes - Oral cavity - Gastrointestinal tract* - Lungs* NOTE: *Must be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic AND does not require systemic cytotoxic therapy - Serological documentation of HIV infection, as evidenced by positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western Blot test, or other federally approved licensed HIV test - At least 5 measurable, non-irradiated, cutaneous indicator lesions - Patients must have 3 lesions at least 5 x 5 mm that are accessible for 4 mm punch biopsy PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - 18 and over Performance status - Karnofsky 60-100% Life expectancy - At least 3 months Hematopoietic - Hemoglobin \u2265 8.0 g/dL - Absolute neutrophil count \u2265 1,000/mm^3 - Platelet count \u2265 75,000/mm^3 Hepatic - AST and ALT \u2264 2.5 times upper limit of normal - Bilirubin normal - Patients with elevated bilirubin secondary to indinavir or atazanavir allowed provided total bilirubin is < 3.5 mg/dL AND direct bilirubin is normal - No acute or known chronic liver disease (e.g., chronic active hepatitis or cirrhosis) - Hepatitis C infection with minimal or no fibrosis on liver biopsy allowed Renal - Creatinine \u2264 1.5 mg/dL OR - Creatinine clearance > 60 mL/min Cardiovascular - No New York Heart Association class III or IV cardiac disease - No congestive heart failure - No myocardial infarction within the past 6 months Other - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective barrier contraception during and for 3 months after study participation - No concurrent active opportunistic infection - No other severe and/or life-threatening medical disease - No other malignancy within the past 5 years except clinically insignificant malignancy not requiring active intervention, basal cell skin cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - More than 4 weeks since prior biologic therapy for KS - More than 2 weeks since prior granulocyte colony-stimulating factor - No concurrent biologic agents for KS Chemotherapy - More than 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy for KS (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin) - No concurrent chemotherapy for KS, including systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy Endocrine therapy - No concurrent systemic corticosteroid therapy except replacement doses Radiotherapy - See Disease Characteristics - More than 4 weeks since prior radiotherapy for KS - No concurrent radiotherapy for KS Surgery - More than 2 weeks since prior major surgery Other - No prior imatinib mesylate - More than 60 days since prior local therapy to any KS indicator lesion unless the lesion has progressed since treatment - More than 4 weeks since prior investigational therapy for KS - More than 4 weeks since other prior therapy for KS - More than 14 days since prior acute treatment for an infection or other serious medical illness - No concurrent warfarin - No concurrent grapefruit juice - No other concurrent therapy for KS - No other concurrent investigational drugs - Concurrent antiretroviral therapy required except for patients who have exhausted all available treatment options", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "recurrent Kaposi sarcoma", "mesh_term": ["Sarcoma", "Sarcoma, Kaposi", "Imatinib Mesylate"], "id": "NCT00090987"}
