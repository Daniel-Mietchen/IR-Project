{"brief_title": "The Safety and Effectiveness of 935U83 in HIV-Infected Patients", "brief_summary": "To assess the safety, tolerance, and steady-state pharmacokinetics of multiple oral doses of 935U83 administered to patients with HIV infection. To obtain preliminary evidence of antiretroviral activity of 935U83. To prospectively evaluate the emergence of in vitro drug resistance. To determine the effects of 935U83 dosing on CD4+ cell counts.", "detailed_description": "Patients (10 per dose level) are randomized to receive 1 of 4 doses of 935U83 every 8 hours for 12 weeks. Five patients at each dose level must complete 4 weeks of treatment without serious toxicity before subsequent patients are entered at the next higher dose. If lack of antiretroviral effect or unacceptable toxicity is demonstrated at a particular dose level, the dose regimens may be adjusted.", "condition": ["HIV Infections"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Raluridine"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria Concurrent Medication: Recommended: - PCP prophylaxis for patients whose CD4 counts fall below 200 cells/mm3 or who develop PCP during study participation.
