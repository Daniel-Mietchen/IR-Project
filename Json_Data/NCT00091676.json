{"brief_title": "Study of the BiovaxId Tumor Derived Idiotype Vaccine in Patients With Follicular Lymphoma", "brief_summary": "The primary objective of this Phase 3 study is to definitively confirm the safety and efficacy of BiovaxId, an autologous tumor derived immunoglobulin idiotype vaccine, as measured by a significant prolongation of the period of disease free survival when administered to patients with indolent follicular Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) during their first complete remission.", "detailed_description": "Patients with Stage III-IV follicular lymphoma and tumor > 2cm (Stage II allowed if tumor > 5cm), previously untreated by other than local radiation, provide tumor material by tissue biopsy for production of a patient-specific Ig idiotype vaccine conjugated to the immunogenic protein KLH. After completing PACE or CHOP-R chemotherapy and achieving a complete remission, followed by a waiting period to reconstitute the immune system, patients who remain in remission randomized to the active treatment arm receive a series of 5 idiotype vaccinations accompanied by the immune stimulant GM-CSF. Patients randomized to the control arm receive a time-matched series of KLH injections also accompanied by GM-CSF. Patients are subsequently studied to observe their immune responses both to the non-specific immune stimulating agents and for the specific immune response to the vaccine. Patients are followed for a minimum of 4 years post-randomization or until relapse.", "condition": "Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma", "intervention_type": "Biological", "intervention_name": "KLH + GM-CSF", "description": "5 monthly vaccinations at month 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 consisting of 0.5 mg KLH s.c on day 1 and 100 mcg/m\u00b2/day GM-CSF s.c. on days 1-4", "arm_group_label": "KLH + GM-CSF", "criteria": "Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria: - Diagnosis of indolent follicular lymphoma(follicular small-cleaved cell, follicular mixed or follicular large cell with centrocytes) with surface IgM or IgG phenotype. - Stage III-IV with lymph node > 2cm or Stage II with lymph node > 5 cm - No prior chemotherapy other than local radiation (not greater than 2 sites) - ECOG < 2 - Survival > 1 yr - Serum creatinine < 1.5 mg/dl - Bilirubin <1.5 mg/dl - SGOT/SGPT < 3.5 ULN - No HIV antibodies or HBV antigen - Negative pregnancy screen (females) - No unrelated neoplasm in the previous 10 years - No evidence of primary or secondary CNS lymphoma", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00091676.xml"}
