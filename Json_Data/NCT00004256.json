{"brief_title": "Sargramostim to Prevent Mucositis in Patients Receiving Radiation Therapy for Laryngeal Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs such as sargramostim may protect normal cells from the side effects of radiation therapy. PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to determine the effectiveness of sargramostim in preventing mucositis in patients who are receiving radiation therapy for laryngeal cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of sargramostim (GM-CSF) in reducing the duration and severity of mucositis resulting from accelerated radiotherapy in patients with laryngeal carcinoma. - Determine the effect of GM-CSF on quality of life aspects of these patients as assessed by nutritional status, analgesic use, and days in the hospital. OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients receive radiotherapy in 16 fractions over 21 days. Patients are randomly allocated to one of two treatment arms before scheduled radiotherapy begins. - Arm I: Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC daily for 14 days beginning on day 14 of the course of radiotherapy. - Arm II: Patients do not receive GM-CSF. Patients are followed weekly until mucositis is healed, as well as at weeks 2 and 6 following the end of radiotherapy. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 34 patients (17 per arm) will be accrued for this study.", "condition": "Radiation Toxicity", "intervention_type": "Radiation", "intervention_name": "radiation therapy", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Diagnosis of laryngeal cancer with intention to treat by radiotherapy using a 16 fraction 3 week scheme - Stage I or II - No known CNS disease PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 20 to 80 Performance status: - WHO 0-1 Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - Not specified Hepatic: - Hepatic function normal Renal: - Renal function normal Other: - Not pregnant or nursing - No serious active infection requiring antibiotic therapy - No autoimmune disease - No known seizures - No psychosocial factors that would preclude study compliance - No allergies to sargramostim (GM-CSF) - Willingness to cooperate for regular mirror examination of the larynx PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - No concurrent immunotherapy Chemotherapy: - No concurrent chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: - No prior or concurrent corticosteroids - No concurrent hormonal therapy Radiotherapy: - See Disease Characteristics Surgery: - No major organ allografts Other: - No other concurrent investigational drugs", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "20 Years", "maximum_age": "80 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00004256.xml"}
