{"brief_title": "PS-341 and Doxorubicin in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining PS-341 and doxorubicin in treating patients who have advanced solid tumors.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of PS-341 in combination with doxorubicin in patients with advanced solid tumors. - Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of PS-341. Patients receive PS-341 IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11; and doxorubicin IV on over 3-5 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of PS-341 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-31 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.", "condition": ["Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["bortezomib", "doxorubicin hydrochloride"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced solid tumor for which no curative treatment exists - Measurable or evaluable disease - No brain metastases or primary brain tumors PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - Over 18 Performance status: - ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - Absolute neutrophil count greater than 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count greater than 100,000/mm^3 Hepatic: - Bilirubin normal Renal: - Creatinine no greater than 1.5 mg/dL OR - Creatinine clearance at least 60 mL/min Cardiovascular: - MUGA at least 45% Other: - No serious active infection - No pre-existing neuropathy grade 2 or greater - No other concurrent illness that would preclude study participation - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - Not specified Chemotherapy: - At least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy - No prior cumulative dose of doxorubicin exceeding 280 mg/m^2 Endocrine therapy: - Not specified Radiotherapy: - At least 4 weeks since prior radiotherapy Surgery: - Not specified Other: - No other concurrent investigational or commercial agents for treatment of this malignancy", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "120 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "unspecified adult solid tumor, protocol specific", "mesh_term": ["Doxorubicin", "Liposomal doxorubicin", "Bortezomib", "Proteasome Inhibitors"], "id": "NCT00023855"}
