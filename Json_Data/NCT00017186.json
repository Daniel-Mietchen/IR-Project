{"brief_title": "Gemcitabine and Epirubicin in Treating Patients With Malignant Mesothelioma", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining gemcitabine and epirubicin in treating patients who have malignant mesothelioma.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the antitumor activity of gemcitabine and epirubicin in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in this patient population. - Determine the time to progression and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Assess quality of life in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 and epirubicin IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses beyond CR. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, prior to course 3, at 3 months, and then at 1 year. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 3 years.", "condition": ["Malignant Mesothelioma"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["epirubicin hydrochloride", "gemcitabine hydrochloride"], "arm_group_label": ["gemcitabine + epirubicin", "gemcitabine + epirubicin"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically or cytologically confirmed malignant pleural mesothelioma - At least 1 measurable lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension - At least 20 mm (2 cm) in diameter PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 and over Performance status: - ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy: - At least 12 weeks Hematopoietic: - Absolute neutrophil count at least 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 100,000/mm^3 Hepatic: - Bilirubin no greater than 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) - AST no greater than 3 times ULN Renal: - Creatinine no greater than 1.5 times ULN Cardiovascular: - LVEF at least 50% - No history of congestive heart failure - No New York Heart Association class III or IV heart disease Other: - No uncontrolled infection - No other severe underlying disease that would preclude study participation - No other malignancy within the past 5 years except adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, noninvasive carcinomas, or localized prostate cancer - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception during and for 6 months after study participation PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Chemotherapy: - No more than 1 prior chemotherapy regimen for malignant pleural mesothelioma - No prior gemcitabine or anthracyclines Other: - No concurrent cimetidine", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "recurrent malignant mesothelioma", "mesh_term": ["Mesothelioma", "Lung Neoplasms", "Gemcitabine", "Epirubicin"], "id": "NCT00017186"}
