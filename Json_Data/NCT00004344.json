Hormone levels are tested every other week. If luteinizing hormone and follicular-stimulating hormone levels are at or below detection on day 56, blood is drawn for a testis-stimulating factor bioassay and subsequent factor purification and characterization. Volunteers are asked to repeat this 2-month procedure no more than 2 times every 12 months.", "condition": "Precocious Puberty", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "testosterone", "criteria": "PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA: Adult men diagnosed with precocious puberty (familial testotoxicosis) as boys", "gender": "Male", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00004344.xml"}
