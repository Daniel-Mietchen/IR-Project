{"brief_title": "Capecitabine in Treating Patients With Advanced, Persistent, or Recurrent Cervical Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of capecitabine in treating patients who have advanced, persistent, or recurrent cervical cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the activity of capecitabine in patients with advanced, persistent, or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. - Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28-62 patients will be accrued for this study within 9-20 months.", "condition": "Cervical Cancer", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "capecitabine", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed advanced, persistent, or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix - Documented disease progression after local therapy and considered incurable - At least 1 target lesion measurable in at least 1 dimension - At least 20 mm by conventional techniques, including palpation, plain x-ray, CT scan, or MRI OR at least 10 mm by spiral CT scan - Target lesion cannot be in a previously irradiated field PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - Any age Performance status: - GOG 0-2 Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - Absolute neutrophil count at least 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 100,000/mm^3 Hepatic: - Bilirubin no greater than 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) - SGOT no greater than 2.5 times ULN - Alkaline phosphatase no greater than 2.5 times ULN Renal: - Creatinine clearance at least 50 mL/min Other: - Not pregnant - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception - No active infection requiring antibiotics - No other invasive malignancy within the past 5 years except nonmelanoma skin cancer - No neuropathy (sensory and motor) greater than grade I PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - At least 3 weeks since prior biologic therapy or immunotherapy for the malignant tumor - No concurrent prophylactic filgrastim (G-CSF) Chemotherapy: - At least 3 weeks since prior chemotherapy for the malignant tumor and recovered - No prior cytotoxic therapy (except when used as a radiosensitizer) - No prior chemotherapy for other malignancy Endocrine therapy: - At least 1 week since prior hormonal therapy for the malignant tumor - Concurrent hormone replacement therapy allowed Radiotherapy: - See Disease Characteristics - At least 3 weeks since prior radiotherapy for the malignant tumor and recovered - No prior radiotherapy for other malignancy Surgery: - Recovered from prior surgery Other: - At least 3 weeks since any other prior therapy for the malignant tumor - No prior anticancer therapy that contraindicates study therapy - No concurrent amifostine or other protective reagents", "gender": "Female", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00016926.xml"}
