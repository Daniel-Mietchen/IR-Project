{"brief_title": "Umbilical Cord Blood and Placental Blood Transplantation in Treating Patients With Hematologic Cancer or Aplastic Anemia", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Umbilical cord blood or placental blood transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were destroyed by the chemotherapy or radiation therapy that was used to kill cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of umbilical cord blood and placental blood transplantation in treating patients who have hematologic cancer or aplastic anemia.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, acute leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, myelodysplasia, aplastic anemia, Fanconi's anemia, histiocytosis, hereditary immunodeficiency, or storage disorder treated with allogeneic umbilical cord and placental blood transplantation. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Determine survival in these patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the incidence of graft-versus-host disease in these patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: Patients receive a standard preparative regimen for their disease. Following the preparative regimen patients undergo umbilical cord blood stem cell transplantation on day 0. Patients are followed every 1-2 weeks for 6 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 4-5 years.", "condition": "Myelodysplastic/Myeloproliferative Neoplasms", "intervention_type": "Procedure", "intervention_name": "umbilical cord blood transplantation", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia, acute leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, myelodysplasia, aplastic anemia, Fanconi's anemia, histiocytosis, hereditary immunodeficiency, or storage disorder - Eligible for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, but lacking a donor - Available donor umbilical cord blood that is mismatched on no more than 2 HLA loci - HIV negative - Hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C negative PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - Under physiologic 60 Performance status: - Not specified Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - Not specified Hepatic: - Bilirubin less than 2 times normal - No severe hepatic disease - Hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C negative Renal: - Creatinine less than 2 times normal Other: - HIV negative - Not pregnant or nursing - No other serious medical or psychiatric illness that would preclude study compliance - No serious infection PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - Not specified Chemotherapy - Not specified Endocrine therapy - Not specified Radiotherapy - Not specified Surgery - Not specified", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "60 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00008164.xml"}
