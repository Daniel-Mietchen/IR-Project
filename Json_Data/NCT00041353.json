{"brief_title": "Comparison of Biomarkers Based on Fine-Needle Aspiration in Women at Increased or Normal Risk of Breast Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Examining biomarkers in fine-needle aspiration specimens from women at risk for breast cancer may improve the ability to detect breast cancer cells early and plan effective treatment. PURPOSE: Screening trial to compare specific biomarkers based on fine-needle aspiration specimens from women at increased or normal risk of breast cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Compare specific biomarkers, including cellular morphology (cytology), proliferation index (Ki-67), p53 expression, and LOH in chromosome 9p at locus DS9157, in fine needle aspirate specimens from women at increased vs normal risk of breast cancer. - Determine whether these specimens are adequate to perform the biomarker assays and whether this technique could be used in the general outpatient setting. - Determine whether biomarker levels in these patients are concordant or discordant with individual clinical risk of breast cancer. - Determine whether 1 or more biomarkers can distinguish high-risk from control patients. - Correlate specific biomarkers and changes in biomarker levels with pathologic diagnosis from the breast biopsy. OUTLINE: Patients undergo fine needle aspiration of normal appearing breast tissue prior to the beginning of elective surgery. Specimens are analyzed for the presence of specific biomarkers. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 156 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.", "condition": ["Breast Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Other", "Procedure", "Procedure"], "intervention_name": ["cytology specimen collection procedure", "comparison of screening methods", "study of high risk factors"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Increased risk of breast cancer as determined by 1 or more first-degree relatives (mother, sister, or daughter) with a history of breast cancer OR a personal history of atypical hyperplasia, lobular carcinoma in situ, or ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast OR - No increased risk of breast cancer as determined by a lack of the above conditions - Scheduled to undergo elective breast surgery for removal of a mammographic lesion or palpable breast lump - No prior bilateral mastectomy or bilateral breast irradiation - Hormone receptor status: - Not specified PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 30 and over Sex: - Female Menopausal status: - Not specified Performance status: - Not specified Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - Not specified Hepatic: - Not specified Renal: - Not specified Other: - No active invasive malignancy in any site except basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer - No significant medical or psychiatric problems that would preclude study - No evidence of excessive use of narcotics or drug dependency PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - Not specified Chemotherapy: - Not specified Endocrine therapy: - Not specified Radiotherapy: - See Disease Characteristics Surgery: - See Disease Characteristics", "gender": "Female", "minimum_age": "30 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "lobular breast carcinoma in situ", "mesh_term": ["Breast Neoplasms"], "id": "NCT00041353"}
