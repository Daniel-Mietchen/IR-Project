{"brief_title": "Rebeccamycin Analogue in Treating Patients With Advanced Liver and/or Biliary Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of rebeccamycin analogue in treating patients who have advanced liver and/or biliary cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate in patients with advanced hepatobiliary carcinoma treated with rebeccamycin analogue. - Assess the toxicity associated with this drug in this patient population. - Evaluate the survival of this patient population treated with this drug. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is a partial dose-escalation study. Patients receive rebeccamycin analogue IV over 1 hour daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts according to hepatic dysfunction. (Cohort I closed to accrual as of 11/1/03.) - Cohort I (closed to accrual as of 11/1/03): Patients receive a fixed dose of rebeccamycin analogue. - Cohort II: Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of rebeccamycin analogue until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-37 months.", "condition": "Liver Cancer", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "becatecarin", "description": "Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of rebeccamycin analogue until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.", "other_name": "rebeccamycin analogue, tartrate salt", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Diagnosis of advanced hepatobiliary carcinoma not amenable to conventional surgery - Gall bladder carcinoma - Cholangiocarcinoma - Carcinoma of the ampulla - Hepatocellular carcinoma (eligible for cohort II only) - Measurable disease - No known brain metastases PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 and over Performance status: - ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy: - At least 12 weeks Hematopoietic: - WBC at least 3,000/mm^3 - Granulocyte count at least 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 100,000/mm^3 - Hemoglobin greater than 10 g/dL Hepatic: - Bilirubin less than 3 mg/dL - Cohort I (closed to accrual as of 11/1/03) - Bilirubin no greater than 1.5 mg/dL - AST no greater than 2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) - Cohort II - Bilirubin greater than 1.5 mg/dL and less than 3 mg/dL OR - Bilirubin no greater 1.5 mg/dL AND AST greater than 2.5 times ULN Renal: - Creatinine normal OR - Creatinine clearance at least 60 mL/min Cardiovascular: - No New York Heart Association class III or IV heart disease Other: - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - Not specified Chemotherapy: - No prior chemotherapy for cholangiocarcinoma or hepatobiliary carcinoma Endocrine therapy: - Not specified Radiotherapy: - Not specified Surgery: - Not specified Other: - No concurrent combination antiviral therapy for HIV-positive patients", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00005997.xml"}
