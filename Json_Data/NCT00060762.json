{"brief_title": "Effectiveness of Binge Eating Disorder Treatments", "brief_summary": "This study will evaluate the long-term effectiveness of interpersonal psychotherapy, behavioral weight loss interventions, and guided self help treatments in treating binge eating disorder (BED).", "detailed_description": "BED is a serious condition that is associated with psychiatric comorbidity, psychosocial impairment, and obesity. Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), behavioral weight loss (BWL) interventions, and guided self help (GSH) treatments for BED have been evaluated, but the safest and most effective treatment has not yet been identified. This study will determine which of these three treatments is most effective in treating BED. Participants are stratified by negative affect subtype and are randomly assigned for 6 months to one of three treatment groups: IPT, BWL, or GSH. IPT focuses on current interpersonal problems which are hypothesized to increase negative affect and lead to binge eating. BWL interventions involve the adoption of weight loss inducing behaviors. GSH is a shortened version of cognitive behavioral therapy that focuses directly on eating behavior. IPT and BWL patients have 20 treatment sessions; those receiving GSH have 10 sessions. Assessments are made pre-treatment, post-treatment, and at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after treatment is complete.", "condition": ["Eating Disorders"], "intervention_type": ["Behavioral", "Behavioral", "Behavioral"], "intervention_name": ["Interpersonal Therapy", "Behavioral Weight Loss Treatment", "Guided Self Help"], "description": ["20 sessions of interpersonal therapy were provided over a 6-month period", "20 sessions of behavioral weight loss treatment were provided over a 6-month period", "10 sessions of guided self help were provided over a 6-month period"], "arm_group_label": ["Interpersonal Therapy", "Behavioral Weight Loss Treatment", "Guided Self Help"], "other_name": ["IPT", "BWL; Weight loss treatment", "GSH"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - DSM-IV criteria for Binge Eating Disorder - Body Mass Index (BMI) between 27 and 45 Exclusion criteria: - Body Mass index > 45 - Current psychosis - Current bipolar disorder - Alcohol or drug dependence within last 6-months", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "65 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "Weight Loss", "mesh_term": ["Feeding and Eating Disorders", "Binge-Eating Disorder"], "id": "NCT00060762"}
