{"brief_title": "Cytogenetic Studies in Acute Leukemia and Multiple Myeloma", "brief_summary": "Chromosomal analysis or the study of genetic differences in patients previously untreated with AML, ALL, MDS or MM may be helpful in the diagnosis and classification of disease. It may also improve the ability to predict the course of disease and the selection of therapy. Institutions must have either an Alliance-approved cytogeneticist or an agreement from an Alliance-approved main member cytogenetics laboratory to enroll a patient on CALGB 8461. The Alliance Approved Institutional Cytogeneticists list is posted on the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology website.", "condition": "Multiple Myeloma", "intervention_type": "Genetic", "intervention_name": "cytogenetic analysis", "arm_group_label": "No treatment", "study_pop": "\n      ", "sampling_method": "Non-Probability Sample", "criteria": "1.
