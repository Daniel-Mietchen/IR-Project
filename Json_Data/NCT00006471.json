{"brief_title": "Fenretinide in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Head and Neck Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of fenretinide in treating patients who have recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate, time to progression, median survival, and percent of 1-year survival in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated with fenretinide. - Determine the pharmacokinetics and safety of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral fenretinide every 12 hours on days 1-7. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for at least 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve complete response continue treatment for 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-35 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": "Head and Neck Cancer", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Fenretinide", "description": "1800 mg/m2 per day for seven consecutive days, in two divided doses of 900 mg/m2 12 hours apart, repeated every 3 weeks.", "arm_group_label": "Fenretinide", "other_name": "4-HPR", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: 1.

Women of childbearing potential must agree to utilize two methods of effective birth control, one barrier, one hormonal, or should abstain from sexual intercourse that could result in pregnancy. Contraceptive measures should be continued for at least one month after fenretinide administration has been discontinued. 13. It is recommended that male patients with female partners of childbearing potential use barrier contraception while on fenretinide. Exclusion Criteria: 1.
