{"brief_title": "SWOG-9507, Fenretinide in Treating Patients With Neoplasia of the Mouth", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the development or recurrence of cancer. The use of fenretinide may be an effective way to prevent the development of cancer in patients with neoplasia of the mouth. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of fenretinide in preventing cancer in patients who have neoplasia of the mouth.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy of fenretinide in patients with oral intraepithelial neoplasia. II. Assess the toxicity of fenretinide in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral fenretinide on days 1-25 every 28 days for a maximum of 6 courses. After 6 courses, patients receive a post-treatment biopsy. Patients exhibiting disease progression or unacceptable toxicities are removed from the study. Patients are followed at 3 and 6 months.
