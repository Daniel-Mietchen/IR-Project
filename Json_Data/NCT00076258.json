{"brief_title": "Adding Exercise to Antidepressant Medication Treatment for Depression", "brief_summary": "This study will assess the effectiveness of an exercise program in improving antidepressant medication treatment for individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD).", "detailed_description": "Partial response to antidepressant treatment is common in people with MDD and is associated with significant morbidity and reduced quality of life. Pharmacological therapies have been used to augment the effect of antidepressants; however, such therapies are associated with a range of adverse effects. Studies indicate that exercise may be safe and effective in augmenting depression treatment. This study will determine whether exercise can complement selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) therapy in people with MDD who have residual symptoms of depression despite drug treatment. Participants will be randomly assigned to either high frequency exercise or low frequency exercise for 12 weeks. Depression symptoms will be measured weekly. Quality of life and satisfaction with the study will also be measured. Depression scales and self-reports will be used to assess participants.", "condition": ["Depression"], "intervention_type": ["Behavioral", "Behavioral"], "intervention_name": ["SSRI + LD", "SSRI + PHD"], "description": ["Eligible participants who have completed an adequate trial of SSRI monotherapy and all screening visits are randomly assigned to 24 weeks of SSRI augmentation with : a low dose of aerobic exercise (LD) or a public health dose of aerobic exercise (PHD).
