{"brief_title": "SB-715992 in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Recurrent Malignant Melanoma", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as SB-715992, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well SB-715992 works in treating patients with metastatic or recurrent malignant melanoma.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of SB-715992, in terms of response rate, in patients with previously untreated metastatic or recurrent malignant melanoma. - Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients. - Determine the early progression rate and response duration in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. - Correlate pharmacokinetics with safety and efficacy endpoints of this drug in these patients. - Correlate \u03b2-tubulin and kinesin spindle protein expression in tumor tissue with clinical outcomes in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, multicenter study. Patients receive SB-715992 IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. All patients are followed at 4 weeks after completion of protocol therapy. Patients with ongoing complete response, partial response, or stable disease are followed every 3 months thereafter until relapse. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-14 months.", "condition": ["Melanoma (Skin)"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["ispinesib"], "description": ["SB-715992 will be given as a 1 hour intravenous infusion in a dose of 18 mg/m2 once every 3 weeks."], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed malignant melanoma - Previously untreated metastatic or recurrent disease - Considered incurable by standard therapies - Measurable disease - At least one unidimensionally measurable lesion \u2265 20 mm by conventional techniques OR \u2265 10 mm by spiral CT scan - Bone metastases are not considered measurable disease - Outside any previously irradiated area - Patients whose sole site of measurable disease is in a previously irradiated area are ineligible unless there is evidence of progression or new lesions documented in the irradiated field - No known CNS metastases - CT scans or MRI are not required to rule out CNS metastases unless patient exhibits neurological signs or symptoms - Patients with a prior solitary brain metastasis surgically resected with no evidence of residual disease are eligible provided CT scan or MRI confirms no evidence of disease within the past 28 days - Archival paraffin tumor specimen available PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - 18 and over Performance status - ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy - At least 12 weeks Hematopoietic - Absolute granulocyte count \u2265 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count \u2265 100,000/mm^3 Hepatic - Bilirubin normal - AST and ALT \u2264 2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) Renal - Creatinine \u2264 1.5 times ULN Cardiovascular - No symptomatic congestive heart failure - No unstable angina pectoris - No cardiac arrhythmia Other - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception - No other malignancy except adequately treated nonmelanoma skin cancer, curatively treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or other curatively treated solid tumors with no evidence of disease for \u2265 5 years - No other uncontrolled illness - No ongoing or active infection - No psychiatric illness or social situation that would preclude study participation - No history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biological composition to SB-715992 PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - At least 3 months since prior adjuvant immunotherapy - No prior immunotherapy for metastatic or recurrent disease Chemotherapy - No prior chemotherapy, including regional therapy Endocrine therapy - Not specified Radiotherapy - See Disease Characteristics - At least 4 weeks since prior radiotherapy except for low-dose, non-myelosuppressive radiotherapy Surgery - See Disease Characteristics - At least 4 weeks since prior major surgery Other - More than 28 days since prior investigational agents - More than 14 days since prior and no concurrent use of any of the following CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers: - Clarithromycin - Erythromycin - Troleandomycin - Itraconazole - Ketoconazole - Fluconazole (\u2264 200 mg/day allowed) - Voriconazole - Nefazodone - Fluvoxamine - Verapamil - Diltiazem - Grapefruit juice - Bitter orange - Phenytoin - Carbamazepine - Phenobarbital - Oxcarbazepine - Rifampin - Rifabutin - Rifapentine - Hypericum perforatum (St. John's wort) - Modafinil - At least 6 months since prior and no concurrent amiodarone - No concurrent antiretroviral therapy for HIV-positive patients - No other concurrent anticancer treatment - No other concurrent investigational therapies", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "stage IV melanoma", "mesh_term": ["Melanoma"], "id": "NCT00095953"}
