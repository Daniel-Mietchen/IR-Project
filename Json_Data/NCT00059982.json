{"brief_title": "Perifosine in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced, Unresectable, or Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Perifosine may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of perifosine in treating patients who have locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic pancreatic cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the activity of perifosine, in terms of objective response, in patients with locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic pancreatic cancer. - Determine the response duration, progression-free survival, and overall survival of patients treated with this drug. - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral perifosine every 6 hours for a total of 6 doses and then once daily in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35-84 patients will be accrued for this study within 21 months.", "condition": "Pancreatic Cancer", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "perifosine", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the pancreas - Locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic disease - Measurable disease - No known brain metastases PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - 18 and over Performance status - ECOG 0-1 Life expectancy - Not specified Hematopoietic - WBC at least 3,500/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 100,000/mm^3 - Hemoglobin at least 10 g/dL Hepatic - AST no greater than 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) - Bilirubin no greater than 2 times ULN Renal - Creatinine no greater than 1.4 mg/dL Cardiovascular - No symptomatic congestive heart failure - No unstable angina pectoris - No cardiac arrhythmia Other - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception - No ongoing or active infection - No psychiatric illness or social situation that would preclude study compliance - No other concurrent illness that would preclude study participation PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - Not specified Chemotherapy - No prior chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer - More than 6 months since prior chemotherapy for other diseases Endocrine therapy - Not specified Radiotherapy - At least 4 weeks since prior radiotherapy and recovered Surgery - At least 4 weeks since prior surgery and recovered Other - No other concurrent investigational agents for pancreatic cancer - No concurrent combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-positive patients", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00059982.xml"}
