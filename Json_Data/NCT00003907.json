{"brief_title": "Chemoembolization in Treating Patients With Primary Liver Cancer or Metastases to the Liver", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Chemoembolization kills tumor cells by blocking the blood flow to the tumor and keeping chemotherapy drugs near the tumor. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemoembolization in treating patients who have primary liver cancer or metastases to the liver that cannot be surgically removed.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Evaluate time to progression of disease in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma or neuroendocrine hepatic metastases undergoing chemoembolization. - Evaluate tumor response achievable with chemoembolization in this patient population. - Evaluate the toxicities of this treatment in these patients. - Evaluate survival of these patients following this treatment. - Evaluate extrahepatic patterns of failure following chemoembolization, to determine whether intrahepatic progression may be forestalled and survival affected in these patients. - Validate a consistent method of performing chemoembolization in a multicenter setting. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease (hepatocellular carcinoma vs neuroendocrine hepatic metastases). Patients undergo placement of a visceral arterial catheter. Patients receive doxorubicin, mitomycin, and cisplatin as a chemoemulsion via the arterial catheter into 1 hepatic lobe only. Immediately following delivery of the chemoemulsion, particulate embolization is performed. The opposite lobe, if involved, is treated within 3-5 weeks of treatment of the initial lobe. In the absence of unacceptable toxicity, each involved lobe is treated separately a second time, in the same sequence, beginning 8 weeks after the last lobular chemoembolization. After completion of all protocol therapy, retreatment on study of either lobe is allowed for regrowth, recurrence, or new disease, provided at least 3 months have elapsed since the initial treatment of that lobe. Patients are followed for 5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-42 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.", "condition": "Metastatic Cancer", "intervention_type": "Procedure", "intervention_name": "embolization", "description": "Immediately following delivery of the chemoemulsion, particulate embolization is performed. The particulate embolic material is prepared on a separate table or tray, using absorbable gelatin sponge (Gelfoam, Upjohn, Kalamazoo, MI), in either powder or pledget form. Approximately 1 g of this temporary occlusive agent is dissolved in 20-30 cc of full-strength contrast with 2.4 cc of absolute alcohol.", "arm_group_label": "Neuroendocrine hepatic metastases", "other_name": "TACE", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Biopsy-proven intrahepatic hepatocellular carcinoma or neuroendocrine tumor. - Unresectable. - Bidimensionally measurable disease by Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or UltraSound Scanning (US) within 6 weeks of registration. - Evidence of patent portal vasculature by Doppler US, MRI, or angiography. - Serum total bilirubin < 2.0 mg/dl and serum creatinine < 2.0 mg/dl within 4 weeks of registration. - Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 2000/\u00b5l and platelets > 50,000/\u00b5l within 4 weeks of registration. - Expected survival of at least 3 months. - Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. - Age >= 18 years. Exclusion Criteria: - Evidence of extrahepatic disease that is likely to be life-threatening within 3 months, such as brain or symptomatic lung metastases. - Previous intra-arterial or intra-hepatic chemotherapy or prior systemic chemotherapy within 4 weeks. - Concurrent malignancy. - Pregnant or breast-feeding women. - History of life-threatening contrast allergy.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00003907.xml"}
