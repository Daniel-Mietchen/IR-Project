{"brief_title": "Celecoxib in Patients With Newly Diagnosed GBM Who Are Receiving Anticonvulsant Drugs and Undergoing RT", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Celecoxib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth. It is not yet known whether the effectiveness of celecoxib in treating glioblastoma multiforme is decreased in patients who are receiving anticonvulsant drugs and undergoing radiation therapy. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of celecoxib in treating patients who are receiving anticonvulsant drugs and undergoing radiation therapy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the effects of hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs, such as anticonvulsants, on the pharmacokinetics of celecoxib in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme undergoing radiotherapy. - Determine the effects of steroids on the pharmacokinetics of celecoxib in these patients. Secondary - Determine the safety of celecoxib in these patients. - Determine the duration of survival of patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups based on anticonvulsant therapy. - Group A: Patients treated with any of the following anticonvulsant drugs that induce hepatic metabolic enzymes: - Phenytoin - Carbamazepine - Phenobarbital - Primidone - Oxcarbazepine - Group B: Patients treated with any of the following anticonvulsant drugs that cause modest or no induction of hepatic metabolic enzymes OR no anticonvulsant drug: - Gabapentin - Lamotrigine - Valproic acid - Levetiracetam - Tiagabine - Topiramate - Zonisamide - Felbamate - Induction therapy: Patients in both groups receive oral celecoxib twice* daily on weeks 1-11 and undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week on weeks 2-7. - Maintenance therapy: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. NOTE: *Patients receive only 1 dose on the first day of celecoxib administration. Patients are followed every 2 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 44 patients (22 per group) will be accrued for this study within approximately 8 months.", "condition": ["Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors"], "intervention_type": ["Radiation", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["radiation therapy", "Celecoxib"], "description": ["Radiation is standard treatment 6000cGy in 30 fractions.
