{"brief_title": "Evaluation of Memory Skills in Patients Receiving Radiation Therapy for Brain Metastases", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Assessment of patients undergoing radiation therapy may help to determine the effects of the treatment and may help improve cancer treatment. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the memory skills in patients receiving radiation therapy for brain metastases.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the feasibility of performing a test battery consisting of five neurocognitive measures and a quality of life instrument following radiotherapy in patients with brain metastases. OUTLINE: Patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 3 weeks. Quality of life and neurocognitive function is assessed before study, at completion of radiotherapy, and at 1 month after completion of radiotherapy. Patients are followed at 1 month. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study over 5 months.", "condition": ["Cognitive/Functional Effects", "Metastatic Cancer", "Radiation Toxicity"], "intervention_type": ["Procedure", "Procedure"], "intervention_name": ["management of therapy complications", "quality-of-life assessment"], "arm_group_label": ["Whole brain radiation therapy + neurocognitive assessments", "Whole brain radiation therapy + neurocognitive assessments"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically proven primary malignancy No primary site of hematopoietic origin (leukemia) No leptomeningeal involvement At least 1 measurable brain metastasis by CT or MRI PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: Not specified Performance status: Zubrod 0-1 Life expectancy: At least 3 months Hematopoietic: Not specified Hepatic: Not specified Renal: Not specified Other: Not pregnant or nursing Fertile patients must use effective contraception Neurological function classification 0-2 No major medical illnesses or psychiatric impairments that would preclude study PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: Not specified Chemotherapy: Not specified Endocrine therapy: Not specified Radiotherapy: No prior radiotherapy to the brain Surgery: Not specified", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "cognitive/functional effects", "mesh_term": ["Neoplasm Metastasis", "Radiation Injuries"], "id": "NCT00007007"}
