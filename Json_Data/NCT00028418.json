{"brief_title": "Clofarabine in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia", "brief_summary": "This is a dose-escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated dose and toxic effects of clofarabine in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and other acute leukemias. Clofarabine is a synthesized hybrid nucleoside analog, which is believed to possess the better qualities of fludarabine and chlorodeoxyadenosine, the 2 most active agents against lymphoproliferative disorders. Thus, it is hoped that this drug will be more active and less toxic than similar drugs.", "detailed_description": "The first group of patients will be treated at the starting dose level of 2 mg/m2 over 1 hour daily for 5 days. Dosage escalation will be permitted in individual patients if no toxicity occurred during the preceding course. Subsequent dose escalations will be by 50% until Grade 2 toxicity, then by 35% until the maximum tolerated dose.
