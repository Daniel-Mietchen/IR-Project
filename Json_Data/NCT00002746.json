{"brief_title": "Interleukin-2 in Treating Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of interleukin-2 in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndrome.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety, tolerance, and maximum tolerated dose of subcutaneous interleukin-2 (aldesleukin; IL-2) in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). - Evaluate the hematologic effects of subcutaneous IL-2 in MDS. OUTLINE: IL-2 will be administered in cycles of twice daily subcutaneous injections 7 days a week for 4 consecutive weeks. After each cycle the patient will be evaluated for response. The patient could continue IL-2 therapy for up to 12 cycles. There are 4 dose levels of IL-2. At each dose level 3 patients will be accrued sequentially. Treatment with IL-2 should be continued until grade III toxicity or any side effects requiring hospitalization occurs. After the patient returns to baseline pretherapy values or grade I toxicity, the subject will resume IL-2 at 50% of the initial dose. If the patient again goes into grade III toxicity or is in need of hospitalization, IL-2 will be discontinued. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Between 12-24 patients will be accrued.", "condition": ["Leukemia", "Myelodysplastic Syndromes", "Myelodysplastic/Myeloproliferative Neoplasms"], "intervention_type": ["Biological"], "intervention_name": ["aldesleukin"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed myelodysplastic syndrome: Refractory anemia (RA), refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) - No patients with refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-t) PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 15 and over Performance status: - Karnofsky 70-100 Hematopoietic: - Platelet count greater than 20,000 Hepatic: - Bilirubin less than 1.6 mg/dL - SGOT less than 150 U/L Renal: - Creatinine no greater than 2.0 mg/dL Cardiovascular: - No symptoms of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, edema, clinically manifest hypotension, presence of cardiac arrhythmias on EKG, or severe hypertension Pulmonary: - No significant pleural effusion, dyspnea at rest or severe exertional dyspnea Other: - No patients with nephrotic syndrome - No uncontrolled infections or active peptic ulcer disease - No serious intercurrent medical illness - Not pregnant or nursing - Adequate contraception required of all patients PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - At least 4 weeks since prior immunosuppressive therapy Chemotherapy: - At least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: - At least 2 weeks since corticosteroid therapy - At least 4 weeks since other endocrine therapy Radiotherapy: - At least 4 weeks since prior radiotherapy Surgery: - Not specified", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "15 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "childhood myelodysplastic syndromes", "mesh_term": ["Syndrome", "Leukemia", "Myelodysplastic Syndromes", "Preleukemia", "Myeloproliferative Disorders", "Myelodysplastic-Myeloproliferative Diseases", "Aldesleukin", "Interleukin-2"], "id": "NCT00002746"}
