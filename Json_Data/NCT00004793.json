{"brief_title": "Pilot Study of the Effect of Baclofen and Bromocriptine on Luteinizing Hormone Secretion in Pubertal Children", "brief_summary": "OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the effect of bromocriptine on luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion by suppression of prolactin and stimulation of dopaminergic receptors in early pubertal boys and girls. II. Evaluate the effect of baclofen on LH secretion by stimulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors in early pubertal boys and girls.", "detailed_description": "PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Participants receive bromocriptine or baclofen followed by nocturnal measurements of luteinizing hormone, growth hormone, and sex steroids. Pituitary reserve is evaluated with the administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, and in children undergoing assessment of short stature, standard provocative stimuli.", "condition": "Growth Disorders", "criteria": "- Short stature and/or constitutional growth delay - No epilepsy or risk of epilepsy", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "18 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00004793.xml"}
