{"brief_title": "Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Lung Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of paclitaxel in treating patients who have unresectable stage IIIB, stage IV or recurrent lung cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Assess the therapeutic activity of paclitaxel in patients with bronchoalveolar carcinoma (BAC). - Assess the duration of response in patients presenting with an objective response. - Characterize the acute side effects of paclitaxel in patients with BAC. - Assess the role of some biological parameters in the natural history and the response to therapy of BAC; evaluate the expression of Ki67, p53, and K-ras mutation. OUTLINE: This is an open label, nonrandomized, multicenter study. Paclitaxel is administered every 3 weeks as a 3 hour continuous infusion in dextrose or normal saline. Patients are treated for a minimum of 2 cycles unless serious toxicity or complication occur. Disease is assessed every 6 weeks until documented progression; treatment side effects are assessed separately for each cycle of therapy. Treatment is given up to a maximum of 6 cycles of therapy or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient refusal occurs. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 16 or 25 patients will be accrued.", "condition": ["Lung Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["paclitaxel"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically proven bronchoalveolar carcinoma (BAC) based on these criteria: - Absence of primary adenocarcinoma elsewhere - Absence of a demonstrable central bronchogenic origin - A peripheral location in the lung parenchyma - Intact interstitial framework of the lung - A histological appearance setting it apart from other tumors, with a characteristic pattern of growth: cuboidal or cylindrical cells lining up the alveolar septa with preservation of basic pulmonary architecture - Must be unresectable Stage IIIB, IV, or recurrent BAC - Evidence of multinodular lesions involving the lungs bilaterally or unilaterally (in the latter the lesions must involve more than one lobe) - At least one target lesion bidimensionally measurable that has not undergone prior irradiation - No CNS disease PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 to 75 (inclusive) Performance status: - ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy: - Greater than 3 months Hematopoietic: - ANC at least 1,500/mm^3 Hepatic: - Bilirubin less than 2 times upper limit of normal - SGOT, SGPT, and alkaline phosphatase less than 2 times upper limit of normal Renal: - Creatinine less than 1.5 times upper limit of normal Cardiovascular: - No history of ischemic or congestive heart disease - No arrhythmia requiring chronic cardiopulmonary medications - No history of clinically or electrographically documented myocardial infarction Other: - No preexisting motor or other serious sensory neurotoxicity - No active or prior second primary cancer except basal cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix - No clinical evidence of uncontrolled infection - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test 72 hours prior to start of study medication - Adequate contraception required of all fertile patients PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - Not specified Chemotherapy: - No prior chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: - Not specified Radiotherapy: - At least 4 weeks since radiotherapy - Must have at least one bidimensional lesion outside the irradiated fields Surgery: - Fully recovered from any prior major surgery", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "75 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "adenocarcinoma of the lung", "mesh_term": ["Lung Neoplasms", "Paclitaxel", "Albumin-Bound Paclitaxel"], "id": "NCT00002972"}
