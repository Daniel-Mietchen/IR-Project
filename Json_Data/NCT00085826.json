{"brief_title": "A Phase III Study of the Efficacy of Taxotere/Aptosyn Versus Taxotere/Placebo in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients", "brief_summary": "Taxotere has been approved by the FDA and is considered a standard treatment for patients with lung cancer who have failed prior platinum-containing regimens. The main purpose of this research study is to determine if Aptosyn, when given in combination with Taxotere, will result in prolonged survival when compared to Taxotere alone. This study will also help determine tumor response rates, and the safety profile of Aptosyn in combination with Taxotere. This study has been completed and a publication is pending.", "condition": ["Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Exisulind"], "criteria": "Exclusion Criteria:", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "Non-small Cell Lung Cancer", "mesh_term": ["Lung Neoplasms", "Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung", "Sulindac sulfone", "Docetaxel"], "id": "NCT00085826"}
