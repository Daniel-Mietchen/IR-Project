{"brief_title": "Radiation Therapy and High-Dose Corticosteroids in Treating Older Patients With Primary CNS Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining radiation therapy with a corticosteroid, such as dexamethasone, may be an effective treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of radiation therapy and high-dose dexamethasone in treating older patients with primary CNS non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Assess the effectiveness of high-dose dexamethasone after whole-brain radiotherapy in maintaining response and preventing recurrence in elderly patients with primary central nervous system non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. - Assess the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. - Assess the survival rate of patients after this regimen. - Identify the anatomic rates of recurrence and frequency of systemic involvement in patients treated with this regimen. - Identify the factors that appear to be associated with outcome in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: Patients undergo whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) daily 5 days a week for 4.5 weeks. Beginning 30 days after WBRT is completed, patients receive high-dose dexamethasone IV on days 1-5 during course 1 and on day 1 only during all subsequent courses. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 1 month after radiotherapy, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 years.", "condition": "Lymphoma", "intervention_type": "Radiation", "intervention_name": "radiation therapy", "arm_group_label": "radiation + dexamethasone", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Pathologically confirmed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with intracranial lesions - Intraocular lymphoma eligible, if not sole site of disease - No occult systemic lymphoma - Measurable or evaluable disease by CT scan or MRI - No neoplastic meningitis or gross spinal cord involvement PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 70 and over Performance status: - ECOG 0-3 Other: - No prior history of lymphoma - No other active malignancy except basal cell skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix - HIV negative - No active peptic ulcer disease - No uncontrolled diabetes mellitus - No active pancreatitis - No active bleeding - No poorly controlled major psychiatric illness - No serious uncontrolled infection PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - No prior bone marrow transplantation Chemotherapy: - No prior chemotherapy Radiotherapy: - No prior radiotherapy to the brain or head and neck region Surgery: - No prior transplantations (renal, hepatic, or cardiac)", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "70 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00003278.xml"}
