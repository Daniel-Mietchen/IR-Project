{"brief_title": "Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Persistent Ovarian or Primary Peritoneal Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of paclitaxel in treating patients who have recurrent or persistent ovarian or primary peritoneal cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety and tolerability of intraperitoneal administration of paclitaxel (Paclimer microspheres) in patients with recurrent or persistent ovarian or primary peritoneal carcinoma. II. Determine and confirm the maximum tolerated dose of this regimen in this patient population. III. Determine plasma paclitaxel concentrations at selected times after intraperitoneal administration of Paclimer microspheres in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive intraperitoneal paclitaxel (Paclimer microspheres) every 8 weeks for 2 courses. Cohorts of 1-3 patients receive escalating doses of intraperitoneal paclitaxel (Paclimer microspheres) until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 patients experience dose limiting toxicities. Once the probable MTD is determined, an additional cohort of 8 patients is accrued to confirm the MTD. The MTD is confirmed as the dose level at which at least 6 of 8 patients demonstrate acceptable safety and tolerability. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 24 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": "Primary Peritoneal Cavity Cancer", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "paclitaxel", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Recurrent or persistent ovarian and/or primary peritoneal carcinoma Adequate potential intraperitoneal fluid distribution with no gross fluid loculations and adhesions that would significantly affect intraperitoneal drug distribution PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: 21 and over Performance status: GOG 0-2 Life expectancy: At least 6 months Hematopoietic: Absolute neutrophil count at least 1,500/mm3 WBC at least 3,000/mm3 Platelet count at least 100,000/mm3 Granulocyte count at least 1,500/mm3 Hepatic: Bilirubin no greater than 1.5 times upper limit of normal Renal: Creatinine less than 2.0 mg/dL Other: No other sufficiently severe medical problems unrelated to malignancy that would preclude study compliance or cause exposure to undue risks No prior unmanageable reaction to paclitaxel PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: Not specified Chemotherapy: At least 4 weeks since prior myelosuppressive chemotherapy (6 weeks for nitrosourea and mitomycin) and recovered Endocrine therapy: Not specified Radiotherapy: At least 4 weeks since prior radiotherapy to major bone marrow containing areas Surgery: Not specified Other: At least 1 month since other prior investigational agents", "gender": "Female", "minimum_age": "21 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00005046.xml"}
