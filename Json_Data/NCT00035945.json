Subjects must not be breast feeding. - b) Male patients must be surgically sterile, abstinent, or utilizing a barrier contraceptive method. Abstinence or contraceptive regimen must be maintained during the treatment period and for 4 weeks after discontinuation of therapy. - Anti-HCV antibody positive. - Plasma HCV RNA greater than 10,000 copies/mL. - Prior liver biopsy indicating chronic hepatitis. - WBC count less than or equal to upper limit of normal. - Absolute neutrophil count in normal range for the laboratory. - Platelet count greater than 130,000 cells/mm\u00b3. - Hemoglobin concentration greater than or equal to 11 g/dL. - PT in the normal range for the laboratory. - Normal aPTT. - Bilirubin in the normal range unless due to documented Gilbert's disease. - Serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range. - Urinalysis showing no evidence of infection or active renal disease (e.g., proteinuria). - Subjects must be able to adhere to the visit schedule set forth in this protocol. - Written informed consent prior to the performance of any study related procedures. Exclusion Criteria: Patients with any of the following criteria during screening will not be eligible: - Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (Western immunoblot confirmed presence of anti-HIV antibodies or detection of HIV RNA in blood). - Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (HBV surface antigen or DNA in blood). - Antiviral therapy for HCV within 3 months. - Immunomodulatory therapy (e.g., systemic corticosteriods or interferon) within 3 months. - Advanced or decompensated liver disease (e.g., history of bleeding varices, spontaneous hepatic encephalopathy, ascites) of any etiology such as alcohol, drug, obesity, or hemochromatosis. - ALT greater than 5x ULN. - Histologic evidence of cirrhosis. - Presence of an underlying disease state associated with active bleeding. - Undergoing therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin or warfarin. - Presence of any other active infection requiring therapy. - Presence of malignancy. - Presence or history of any significant medical illness that might interfere with this study. - Receipt of an investigational new drug, biological or therapeutic device within 30 days of study entry. - Alcohol or drug abuse requiring medical intervention within 2 years. - History of non-compliance with prescribed medical care. - Limited mental capacity or language skills to the extent simple instructions cannot be followed or information regarding adverse events cannot be provided", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00035945.xml"}
