Studies suggest that these training programs are effective, but their generalizability and effectiveness in outpatient settings has not been thoroughly examined. This study will examine the treatment outcomes of a skills training approach in schizophrenic individuals taking antipsychotic medication. Participants taking stable doses of risperidone, olanzapine, or quetiapine will be randomly assigned to receive either intensive symptom management and social skills training or group therapy for 12 months. A verbal memory test will be used to stratify the randomization procedure and to control for neurocognitive functioning.", "condition": "Schizophrenia", "intervention_type": "Procedure", "intervention_name": "Social skills and symptom management training", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder for > 5 years - Use of stable dose risperidone, olanzapine, or quetiapine for at least 1 month with no planned medication changes - Social Behavior Scale (SBS) score > 45 - Willing and able to provide informed consent Exclusion Criteria: - Intelligence Quotient < 70 - Use of more than one antipsychotic medication - Use of benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, or anticholinergic medication commonly used to treat extrapyramidal symptoms - Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)-IV criteria for alcohol or other substance dependence - History of any traumatic brain injury leading to loss of consciousness for > 30 minutes - Diagnosis of a comorbid medical condition that could interfere with antipsychotic medication treatment or the ability to complete the study", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "55 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00069433.xml"}
