{"brief_title": "Aminocamptothecin in Treating Patients With Refractory or Recurrent Hodgkin's Disease or Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma", "brief_summary": "Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of aminocamptothecin in treating patients who have refractory or recurrent Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the response rate and duration of response to aminocamptothecin (9-AC) in patients with refractory or relapsed Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. II. Assess the toxicity of 9-AC in these patients. III. Validate a preliminary pharmacodynamic model relating total 9-AC concentration, albumin, and bilirubin to toxicity. IV. Determine whether 9-AC concentrations correlate with response. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by disease histology (International Working Formulation (IWF) A-C vs IWF D-F) and center. Patients receive aminocamptothecin IV continuously on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for a minimum of 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve stable disease, partial response (PR), or complete response (CR) may receive 2 additional courses past best response (minimum of 6 courses if PR or CR). Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.", "condition": "Lymphoma", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "aminocamptothecin", "description": "850 micrograms/square meter/day (total dose 2550 micrograms/square meter) via central venous catheter using infusion pump over 72 hours + one cycle Cycle repeated every 14 days for minimum of 6 cycles if partial or complete response", "arm_group_label": "aminocamptothecin", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically documented Hodgkin's disease (closed to accrual 4/15/2000) OR - Histologically documented non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) of one of the following International Working Formulation (IWF) histologies: - Small lymphocytic (absolute lymphocyte count less than 5,000) - IWF A Follicular, predominantly small cleaved cell - IWF B Follicular mixed - IWF C Follicular large cell - IWF D* Diffuse small cleaved cell - IWF E* Diffuse mixed - IWF F* Diffuse large cell - IWF G* Large cell, immunoblastic - IWF H* * Accrual of patients with these diagnoses closed 4/15/2000 - Pathology review required within 60 days of registration - Refractory to or relapsed after prior chemotherapy as follows: - Low-grade NHL (IWF A-C): 1 or 2 prior therapies - Intermediate-grade NHL (IWF D-H): 1 prior therapy (stratum closed 4/15/2000) - Hodgkin's disease: 1 or 2 prior therapies (stratum closed 4/15/2000) - Treatment with the same drugs on 2 different schedules considered 1 therapy - Measurable disease by physical exam or imaging studies - Mass larger than 1 x 1 cm - Documented progression required of previously irradiated lesions - The following are not considered measurable: - Ascites or pleural effusion - Bone marrow involvement - Positive barium studies - Bony disease (lytic lesions noted) - No mantle cell or transformed lymphoma - No parenchymal or leptomeningeal CNS disease - A new classification scheme for adult non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ.
