{"brief_title": "Vaccine Therapy and Sargramostim Compared With Placebo and Sargramostim Following Rituximab in Treating Patients With Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Vaccines made from a person's cancer cells may make the body build an immune response to kill cancer cells. Colony-stimulating factors such as GM-CSF increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow and peripheral blood. It is not yet known whether combining rituximab and GM-CSF with vaccine therapy may cause a stronger immune response and kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying giving rituximab and GM-CSF together with vaccine therapy and comparing it to giving rituximab and GM-CSF alone in treating patients with newly diagnosed, relapsed, or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare time to disease progression in patients with grade 1, 2, or 3 follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who respond (i.e., complete or partial response, or stable disease) to treatment with rituximab and are then treated with sargramostim (GM-CSF) with vs without autologous immunoglobulin idiotype-KLH conjugate vaccine. Secondary - Compare response rate improvement in patients treated with these regimens. - Compare overall complete response rate in patients treated with these regimens. - Compare duration of response in patients treated with these regimens. - Determine the safety of these regimens in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior treatment (yes vs no) and response to rituximab during study (complete response [CR] or partial response [PR] vs stable disease [SD]). All patients receive rituximab IV once weekly for 4 weeks. Five weeks after the last dose of rituximab, patients are assessed for response. Patients with progressive disease are removed from the study and do not undergo randomization. Patients with a CR, PR, or SD are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive autologous immunoglobulin idiotype-KLH conjugate vaccine subcutaneously (SC) on day 1. Patients also receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC on days 1-4. - Arm II: Patients receive placebo SC on day 1. Patients also receive GM-CSF SC on days 1-4. In both arms, treatment repeats monthly for 6 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or clinically significant progressive disease. After the first 6 months, patients with a CR, PR, or SD may continue to receive treatment (per treatment arm as above) every 2 months for 1 year (total of 6 doses) and then every 3 months thereafter in the absence of disease progression. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months until disease progression. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 342 evaluable patients (171 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 18 months.", "condition": "Lymphoma", "intervention_type": "Biological", "intervention_name": "sargramostim", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) - Grade 1, 2, or 3 - Meets 1 of the following criteria for treatment with rituximab: - Treatment na\u00efve - Relapsed or refractory disease after prior chemotherapy - Relapsed after a prior documented response (i.e., complete or partial response) to rituximab of at least 6 months duration - Tumor accessible for biopsy OR existing biopsy material (taken within the past 6 months) suitable for vaccine preparation - Measurable or evaluable disease after tumor tissue procurement for vaccine production - No more than 2 prior treatment regimens for NHL - Single regimens include any of the following: - Maintenance rituximab - Rituximab administered once weekly for 8 courses - Cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) plus rituximab* NOTE: *CHOP followed by rituximab at time of relapse is considered 2 treatment regimens - No history of CNS lymphoma or meningeal lymphomatosis PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - 18 and over Performance status - ECOG 0-1 Life expectancy - Not specified Hematopoietic - Absolute granulocyte count \u2265 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count \u2265 75,000/mm^3 (unless related to bone marrow involvement by lymphoma) - Hemoglobin \u2265 10g/dL Hepatic - Not specified Renal - Not specified Cardiovascular - No congestive heart failure Pulmonary - No compromised pulmonary function Immunologic - HIV negative - No prior allergic response to GM-CSF - No active bacterial, viral, or fungal infection Other - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception - No psychiatric disorder that would preclude study participation - No other malignancy within the past 2 years except nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix - No other serious nonmalignant disease that would preclude study participation PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - See Disease Characteristics - See Chemotherapy - At least 4 weeks since prior immunotherapy - No prior radiolabeled anti-lymphoma antibody (e.g., iodine I 131 tositumomab or ibritumomab tiuxetan) - No prior autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation - No prior lymphoma-specific idiotype immunotherapy (e.g., Id vaccine) - No prior investigational vaccine or immunotherapeutic containing keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) Chemotherapy - See Disease Characteristics - At least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy - More than 9 months since prior fludarabine - More than 2 years since prior chemotherapy/rituximab combination therapy (e.g., CHOP/rituximab or cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone [CVP]/rituximab) - No more than 6 total prior treatment courses with fludarabine Endocrine therapy - No concurrent steroids for allergic reaction to sargramostim (GM-CSF) Radiotherapy - See Biologic therapy - At least 4 weeks since prior radiotherapy Surgery - Not specified Other - At least 4 weeks since prior experimental therapy - No concurrent systemic immunosuppressive therapy - No other concurrent anti-lymphoma therapy", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00089115.xml"}
