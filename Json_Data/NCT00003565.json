{"brief_title": "Docetaxel in Treating Patients With Solid Tumors", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of docetaxel in treating Caucasian and African American patients who have solid tumors.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Compare the population pharmacokinetics of docetaxel in Caucasians and African American patients with solid tumors. - Compare the pharmacodynamic effect of a single dose of docetaxel in relation to hematological toxicity in these patient populations. - Determine the CYP3A4 genotype and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression and their relationship to docetaxel clearance in these patient populations. OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1. Patients may receive additional courses beginning 21 days after the first docetaxel dose at the discretion of the physician.", "condition": ["Bladder Cancer", "Breast Cancer", "Head and Neck Cancer", "Lung Cancer", "Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["docetaxel"], "arm_group_label": ["docetaxel"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically proven unresectable solid tumors (e.g., lung, breast, head and neck, bladder) - Clinically suitable for treatment with single agent docetaxel - Caucasian (at least 2 generations originating in any of the original peoples of Europe, North Africa, or the Middle East) OR - African American (at least 2 generations originating in any of the black racial groups of Africa) PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 and over Performance status: - 0-2 Hematopoietic: - Granulocyte count at least 1,500/mm3 - Platelet count at least 100,000/mm3 Hepatic: - Bilirubin no greater than upper limit of normal (ULN) - AST no greater than 1.5 times ULN AND - Alkaline phosphatase no greater than 2.5 times ULN Renal: - BUN no greater than 1.5 times ULN - Creatinine no greater 1.5 times ULN Other: - Not pregnant or nursing - Fertile patients must use effective contraception PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - No prior bone marrow transplantation Chemotherapy: - No prior docetaxel - Prior paclitaxel allowed - 1 or 2 prior chemotherapy regimens allowed - At least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin) - No other concurrent chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: - No concurrent hormones for disease related conditions - Concurrent steroids for adrenal failure allowed Radiotherapy: - At least 2 weeks since prior radiotherapy - Palliative radiotherapy allowed except whole brain irradiation for CNS disease Surgery: - Not specified Other: - At least 48 hours since prior or concurrent ethanol (CYP3A enzyme inducer) or grapefruit juice (CYP3A enzyme inhibitor) - At least 7 days since prior or concurrent CYP450 inducing drugs: - Antiseizure medications: phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, or lamotrigine - Anti-TB therapy: rifampin, isoniazid, or sulfinpyrazone - At least 7 days since prior or concurrent CYP450 3A inhibiting drugs: - Macrolides: erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, or roxithromycin - Azoles: ketoconazole, fluconazole, or itraconazole - Other antibiotics: metronidazole or chloramphenicol - Anti-HIV drugs: ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, or delavirdine - Immunosuppressive agents: cyclosporine - Antidepressant agent: nefazodone", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "stage IV salivary gland cancer", "mesh_term": ["Breast Neoplasms", "Lung Neoplasms", "Head and Neck Neoplasms", "Urinary Bladder Neoplasms", "Docetaxel"], "id": "NCT00003565"}
