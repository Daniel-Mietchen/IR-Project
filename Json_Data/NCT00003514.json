{"brief_title": "Antineoplaston Therapy in Treating Patients With Neuroendocrine Tumor That Is Metastatic or Unlikely to Respond to Surgery or Radiation Therapy", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Antineoplastons are naturally-occurring substances that may also be made in the laboratory. Antineoplastons may inhibit the growth of cancer cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well antineoplaston therapy works in treating patients with neuroendocrine tumor that is metastatic or unlikely to respond to surgery or radiation therapy.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Provide treatment with antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 for patients with metastatic or incurable neuroendocrine tumors. - Describe response, tolerance to, and side effects of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients receive gradually escalating doses of antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 by intravenous injection 6 times daily until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Treatment continues for at least 2 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients achieving complete response (CR) continue treatment for an additional 8 months after reaching CR. Tumors are measured every 2 months for 1 year and then every 3 months for 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Merkel Cell Carcinoma", "Islet Cell Carcinoma", "Neuroendocrine Carcinoma", "Pituitary Tumor"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Procedure", "Procedure", "Procedure", "Procedure", "Procedure", "Procedure"], "intervention_name": ["antineoplaston A10", "antineoplaston AS2-1", "alternative product therapy", "biological therapy", "biologically based therapies", "cancer prevention intervention", "complementary and alternative therapy", "differentiation therapy"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed incurable neuroendocrine tumor that is unlikely to respond to existing therapy, meeting 1 of the following criteria: - Metastatic disease - Disease that is not curable with surgery or radiotherapy - Measurable disease by MRI or CT scan - Tumor must be at least 2 cm PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 and over Performance status: - Karnofsky 60-100% Life expectancy: - At least 2 months Hematopoietic: - WBC at least 2,000/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 50,000/mm^3 Hepatic: - No hepatic insufficiency - Bilirubin no greater than 2.5 mg/dL - SGOT and SGPT no greater than 5 times upper limit of normal Renal: - No renal insufficiency - Creatinine no greater than 2.5 mg/dL - No history of renal conditions that contraindicate high dosages of sodium Cardiovascular: - No uncontrolled hypertension - No history of congestive heart failure - No history of other cardiovascular conditions that contraindicate high dosages of sodium Pulmonary: - No serious lung disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Other: - Not pregnant or nursing - Fertile patients must use effective contraception during and for 4 weeks after study participation - No active infection - No concurrent nonmalignant systemic disease - Not a high medical or psychiatric risk PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - At least 4 weeks since prior immunotherapy - No concurrent immunomodulating agents Chemotherapy: - At least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy (6 weeks for nitrosoureas) Endocrine therapy: - Concurrent corticosteroids allowed Radiotherapy: - At least 8 weeks since prior radiotherapy Surgery: - Recovered from prior surgery Other: - Prior cytodifferentiating agents allowed - No prior antineoplastons - No other concurrent antineoplastic agents", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "neuroendocrine carcinoma", "mesh_term": ["Carcinoma", "Neuroendocrine Tumors", "Carcinoid Tumor", "Pituitary Diseases", "Pituitary Neoplasms", "Carcinoma, Neuroendocrine", "Carcinoma, Merkel Cell", "Carcinoma, Islet Cell"], "id": "NCT00003514"}
