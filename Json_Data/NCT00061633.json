One of the ways to deal with this problem is to develop new drugs that can control these bacteria. This study will measure how well TD-6424 (Telavancin) can control infections and whether this drug can be safely given to patients.", "condition": ["Infections, Gram-Positive Bacterial", "Abscess", "Burns", "Cellulitis", "Ulcer", "Wound Infections"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Telavancin", "Vancomycin or antistaphylococcal penicillin"], "description": ["Telavancin 7.5 mg/kg/day IV (intravenously) for up to 14 days", "Vancomycin 1 Gram IV (intravenously) every 12 hrs or nafcillin 2 Grams, oxacillin 2 Grams, or (in South Africa) cloxacillin 0.5 - 1 Gram, IV (intravenously) every 6 hrs for up to 14 days."], "arm_group_label": ["Telavancin", "Standard of care for cSSSI"], "other_name": ["VIBATIV", "TD-6424"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Patients must have a diagnosis of one of the following complicated skin and skin structure infections with either a suspected or confirmed Gram positive organism as the major cause of the infection: - major abscess requiring surgical incision and drainage - infected burn (see exclusion criteria for important qualifications) - deep/extensive cellulitis - infected ulcer (see exclusion criteria for important qualifications) - wound infections - Patients must be expected to require at least 4 days of intravenous antibiotic treatment Exclusion Criteria: - Previous systemic antibacterial therapy (with the exception of aztreonam and metronidazole) for > 24 hours within 7 days prior to the first dose of study medication unless the pathogen was resistant to prior treatment or the patient was a treatment failure (no clinical improvement after 3 days). - Burns involving > 20% of body surface area or third degree/full thickness in nature, diabetic foot ulcers, ischemic ulcers/wounds, necrotizing fasciitis, gas gangrene, or mediastinitis.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "mesh_term": ["Infection", "Communicable Diseases", "Wound Infection", "Cellulitis", "Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections", "Penicillins", "Vancomycin", "Telavancin"], "id": "NCT00061633"}
