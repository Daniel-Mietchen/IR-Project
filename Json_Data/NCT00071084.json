{"brief_title": "Clinical Trial of HuMax-CD4, a New Drug to Treat Advanced Stage T-Cell Lymphoma in the Skin.", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this trial is to determine the effect of HuMax-CD4, as a treatment for advanced stage (late stage) cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Almost all patients who are affected by late stage CTCL have many cancerous cells which bear a receptor called CD4. HuMax-CD4 is an investigational drug directed against this receptor. There is no placebo in this trial; all patients will be treated with HuMax-CD4. The response rates, duration of responses, relief of symptoms, and safety profile of HuMax-CD4 will be evaluated during this trial.", "condition": "Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "HuMax-CD4", "arm_group_label": "280 mg and 980 mg", "criteria": "Inclusion criteria - Medical diagnosis of CTCL, and positivity for the CD4 receptor. - Late stage CTCL. - Have received at least one prior anti-cancer therapy with inadequate effect. - WHO performance status 0,1 or 2 - Male or female, age 18 or older. - Signed informed consent.
