{"brief_title": "Prospective Open-Label Study of the Emergence of Drug Resistance in Patients Infected With HIV-1 Who Are Taking Oral U-87201E", "brief_summary": "To determine the time course of development of resistance to atevirdine mesylate ( U-87201E ) in patients with HIV isolates showing in vitro resistance to zidovudine ( AZT ). To determine the genotype changes in HIV reverse transcriptase associated with in vitro AZT resistance to U-87201E. To determine the genotype and phenotype effects of treatment with a nondideoxynucleoside agent on the alterations of the HIV-1 population associated with in vitro AZT resistance. To determine whether serial passage of patient pre-drug HIV isolates in the presence of U-87201E will generate the resistant mutants that may subsequently emerge in the patients.", "condition": "HIV Infections", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Atevirdine mesylate", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria Patients must have: - Enrollment on protocol RV-43 (AZT resistance study). - Development of a primary RV-43 study endpoint-opportunistic infection. - HIV isolate with an AZT IC50 > 50 times that of the sensitive type strain. - Able to swallow tablets without difficulty. - Normal QTc interval on EKG. Exclusion Criteria Co-existing Condition: Patients with the following symptoms or conditions are excluded: - Clinically significant hypersensitivity to piperazine type drugs (Antepar, Stelazine). - Severe uncontrollable diarrhea or vomiting or known malabsorption. - Symptomatic hyperlipidemia. Concurrent Medication: Excluded: - Other experimental drugs. - AZT, ddI, ddC, foscarnet, immunomodulators or other agents with primary antiretroviral activity (exemptions by principal investigator permitted). Patients with the following prior conditions are excluded: History of clinically significant cardiovascular disease or nervous system or muscle disease, including seizures, peripheral neuropathy, dementia, or motor dysfunction. Prior Medication: Excluded: - Experimental drugs within 4 weeks prior to study entry.", "gender": "Male", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "45 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00002094.xml"}
