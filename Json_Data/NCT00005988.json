{"brief_title": "Bone Marrow Transplantation With Specially Treated Bone Marrow in Treating Patients With Hematologic Cancer That Have Not Responded to Previous Therapy", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Bone marrow transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy or radiation therapy used to kill tumor cells. Sometimes the transplanted cells can make an immune response against the body's normal tissues. Treatment of the donor bone marrow with the patient's white blood cells and a monoclonal antibody may prevent this from happening. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of bone marrow transplantation with specially treated bone marrow in treating patients who have hematologic cancer that has not responded to previous therapy.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine if patients with refractory, high risk hematologic malignancies or bone marrow failure who receive HLA haploidentical bone marrow treated with anti-B7 antibody have normal engraftment. II. Determine if these patients are free of hyperacute graft versus host disease (GVHD), defined as grade D GVHD in the first 10 posttransplant days, when treated with this regimen. III. Determine if these patients have an acceptable incidence of life threatening grade D GHVD in the first 50 posttransplant days following this treatment regimen. IV. Determine the safety and tolerability of this treatment regimen in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients undergo leukapheresis to collect white blood cells which are incubated with donor bone marrow cells in the presence of anti-B7.1 and anti-B7.2 antibodies for 36 hours. Patients receive total body irradiation twice daily on days -6 to -3, cyclophosphamide IV daily on days -2 and -1, and methylprednisolone IV every 12 hours for a total of 4 doses on days -2 to 0. Patients are infused with the treated donor bone marrow on day 0. Patients then receive methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6, and 11 and leucovorin calcium IV 24 hours after each dose of methotrexate every 6 hours for 3-8 doses each time. Patients also receive cyclosporine IV or orally twice daily on days -2 to 100. Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Graft Versus Host Disease", "Leukemia", "Lymphoma", "Myelodysplastic Syndromes", "Myeloma"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Drug", "Drug", "Drug", "Procedure", "Radiation"], "intervention_name": ["cyclophosphamide", "cyclosporine", "leucovorin calcium", "methotrexate", "methylprednisolone", "in vitro-treated bone marrow transplantation", "radiation therapy"], "arm_group_label": ["in vitro-treated bone marrow transplantation", "in vitro-treated bone marrow transplantation", "in vitro-treated bone marrow transplantation", "in vitro-treated bone marrow transplantation", "in vitro-treated bone marrow transplantation", "in vitro-treated bone marrow transplantation", "in vitro-treated bone marrow transplantation"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Age \u226440 years. - Diagnoses\u2014patients with the following hematologic malignancies and bone marrow failure syndromes: - Acute myelogenous leukemia\u2014induction failure, relapse, second or greater complete remission (CR) - Acute lymphocytic leukemia\u2014induction failure, relapse, second or greater CR, first CR with t(9;22), t(8;14), or t(4;11) - Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (intermediate or high grade) which has failed to achieve CR with at least two induction regimens, relapse, second or greater CR - Multiple myeloma with poor prognostic features (elevated 0-2 microglobulin or high labeling index) - Hodgkin's disease in relapse or which fails to achieve CR after two chemotherapy regimens - Congenital or acquired bone marrow failure - poorly responsive to or intolerant of current therapy - Myelodysplastic syndrome of all subtypes except refractory anemia (RA) - Patient has a haploidentical family member that meets medical criteria for donation. - Eligibility for other transplant types: - Patient considered likely to have clinical deterioration and rapid disease progression during an unrelated donor search, or - Patient who has already had an unproductive donor search or - Patient ineligible for or has refused autologous transplant - Adequate renal and hepatic function for age: - Serum creatinine <2 x ULN - Alanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT) x ULN - Aspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT) x ULN - Total bilirubin 5_2 x ULN except if bilirubin is elevated due to Gilbert's syndrome or hemolytic anemia - Adequate cardiac and pulmonary function for age. - ECOG Performance Status 0, 1, or 2 or Lansky performance scale >50% for patients <16 years of age. - Voluntary witnessed written informed consent.
