{"brief_title": "Alvespimycin Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Unresectable Solid Tumors", "brief_summary": "This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of alvespimycin hydrochloride in treating patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as alvespimycin hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.", "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxic effects and maximum tolerated dose of 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG) in patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: II. Determine the effects of this drug on the expression of Hsp90 client proteins in normal and tumor tissue samples from these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive alvespimycin hydrochloride IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 1-2 patients receive accelerated escalating doses of alvespimycin hydrochloride until at least 1 of 2 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Cohorts are then expanded to 3-6 patients who receive escalating doses (in a standard manner) of alvespimycin hydrochloride until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience DLT. Once the MTD is determined, 10 additional patients are treated at that dose.", "condition": ["Male Breast Cancer", "Recurrent Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma of the Oral Cavity", "Recurrent Basal Cell Carcinoma of the Lip", "Recurrent Breast Cancer", "Recurrent Colon Cancer", "Recurrent Esthesioneuroblastoma of the Paranasal Sinus and Nasal Cavity", "Recurrent Gastric Cancer", "Recurrent Inverted Papilloma of the Paranasal Sinus and Nasal Cavity", "Recurrent Lymphoepithelioma of the Nasopharynx", "Recurrent Lymphoepithelioma of the Oropharynx", "Recurrent Melanoma", "Recurrent Metastatic Squamous Neck Cancer With Occult Primary", "Recurrent Midline Lethal Granuloma of the Paranasal Sinus and Nasal Cavity", "Recurrent Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma of the Oral Cavity", "Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer", "Recurrent Prostate Cancer", "Recurrent Renal Cell Cancer", "Recurrent Salivary Gland Cancer", "Recurrent Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Hypopharynx", "Recurrent Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx", "Recurrent Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Lip and Oral Cavity", "Recurrent Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Nasopharynx", "Recurrent Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Oropharynx", "Recurrent Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Paranasal Sinus and Nasal Cavity", "Recurrent Verrucous Carcinoma of the Larynx", "Recurrent Verrucous Carcinoma of the Oral Cavity", "Stage III Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma of the Oral Cavity", "Stage III Basal Cell Carcinoma of the Lip", "Stage III Colon Cancer", "Stage III Esthesioneuroblastoma of the Paranasal Sinus and Nasal Cavity", "Stage III Gastric Cancer", "Stage III Inverted Papilloma of the Paranasal Sinus and Nasal Cavity", "Stage III Lymphoepithelioma of the Nasopharynx", "Stage III Lymphoepithelioma of the Oropharynx", "Stage III Melanoma", "Stage III Midline Lethal Granuloma of the Paranasal Sinus and Nasal Cavity", "Stage III Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma of the Oral Cavity", "Stage III Ovarian Epithelial Cancer", "Stage III Renal Cell Cancer", "Stage III Salivary Gland Cancer", "Stage III Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Hypopharynx", "Stage III Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx", "Stage III Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Lip and Oral Cavity", "Stage III Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Nasopharynx", "Stage III Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Oropharynx", "Stage III Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Paranasal Sinus and Nasal Cavity", "Stage III Verrucous Carcinoma of the Larynx", "Stage III Verrucous Carcinoma of the Oral Cavity", "Stage IIIB Breast Cancer", "Stage IIIC Breast Cancer", "Stage IV Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma of the Oral Cavity", "Stage IV Basal Cell Carcinoma of the Lip", "Stage IV Breast Cancer", "Stage IV Colon Cancer", "Stage IV Esthesioneuroblastoma of the Paranasal Sinus and Nasal Cavity", "Stage IV Gastric Cancer", "Stage IV Inverted Papilloma of the Paranasal Sinus and Nasal Cavity", "Stage IV Lymphoepithelioma of the Nasopharynx", "Stage IV Lymphoepithelioma of the Oropharynx", "Stage IV Melanoma", "Stage IV Midline Lethal Granuloma of the Paranasal Sinus and Nasal Cavity", "Stage IV Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma of the Oral Cavity", "Stage IV Ovarian Epithelial Cancer", "Stage IV Prostate Cancer", "Stage IV Renal Cell Cancer", "Stage IV Salivary Gland Cancer", "Stage IV Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Hypopharynx", "Stage IV Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx", "Stage IV Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Lip and Oral Cavity", "Stage IV Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Nasopharynx", "Stage IV Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Oropharynx", "Stage IV Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Paranasal Sinus and Nasal Cavity", "Stage IV Verrucous Carcinoma of the Larynx", "Stage IV Verrucous Carcinoma of the Oral Cavity", "Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific", "Untreated Metastatic Squamous Neck Cancer With Occult Primary"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Other", "Other"], "intervention_name": ["alvespimycin hydrochloride", "laboratory biomarker analysis", "pharmacological study"], "description": ["Given IV", "Correlative studies", "Correlative studies"], "arm_group_label": ["Treatment (alvespimycin hydrochloride)", "Treatment (alvespimycin hydrochloride)", "Treatment (alvespimycin hydrochloride)"], "other_name": ["17-DMAG HCL", "KOS-1022", "pharmacological studies"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: -
