{"brief_title": "Antineoplaston Therapy in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Refractory High-Grade Stage II, Stage III, or Stage IV Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Antineoplastons are naturally-occurring substances that may also be made in the laboratory. Antineoplastons may inhibit the growth of cancer cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial studies the effectiveness of antineoplaston therapy in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory high-grade stage II, stage III, or stage IV non-Hodgkin's lymphoma after receiving chemotherapy.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety and effectiveness of antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 in patients with serious or immediately life-threatening recurrent or refractory high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. - Describe response to, tolerance to, and side effects of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients receive gradually escalating doses of antineoplaston A10 and antineoplaston AS2-1 by intravenous injection 6 times daily until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Treatment continues for at least 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 12 months, patients with responding or stable disease may continue treatment. Tumors are measured at least every 8 weeks for 6 months, every 3 months for 1.5 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually for 2 years. Patients are followed for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": "Lymphoma", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "antineoplaston AS2-1", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically proven stage II, III, or IV high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that has not responded to, or has relapsed after a standard primary chemotherapy regimen plus at least 1 standard second-line salvage chemotherapy regimen NOTE: A new classification scheme for adult non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been adoptedby PDQ. The terminology of \"indolent\" or \"aggressive\" lymphoma will replace the former terminology of \"low\", \"intermediate\", or \"high\" grade lymphoma.
