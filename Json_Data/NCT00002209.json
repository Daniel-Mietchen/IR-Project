{"brief_title": "Safety and Effectiveness of CPI-1189 in HIV-Infected Males on Combination Anti-HIV Drug Therapy", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe to give multiple doses of CPI-1189 to HIV-infected, otherwise healthy, males. The study will also look at how CPI-1189 affects the levels of HIV, T cells (cells in the body that help fight infection), and three anti-HIV drugs (zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir) in the blood. Advanced HIV infection can cause AIDS dementia (brain damage due to HIV leading to losses of memory and muscle control). CPI-1189 may be able to postpone AIDS dementia or slow it down.", "detailed_description": "Late-stage HIV infection can cause AIDS dementia (brain damage due to HIV leading to losses of memory and muscle control). CPI-1189 may be able to postpone AIDS dementia or slow it down. In this randomized, double-blind study, 48 HIV-infected, otherwise healthy, male volunteers receive either multiple-dose CPI-1189 or placebo by mouth for 15 consecutive days. Each dosing group begins 6 weeks following the start of the preceding group. Volunteers enter the study site the night before dosing on Days 1 and 15 and remain at the study site for 72 hours following dosing. Throughout the study, volunteers have physical exams and donate samples of blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and sperm.", "condition": ["AIDS Dementia Complex", "HIV Infections"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["CPI-1189"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria You may be eligible for this study if you: - Are an HIV-positive man who is otherwise in good health. - Are 18-50 years old. - Have a CD4 count of 75-500 cells/mm3. - Are currently taking zidovudine (ZDV), lamivudine (3TC), and indinavir (IDV).", "gender": "Male", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "50 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors", "mesh_term": ["HIV Infections", "Dementia", "AIDS Dementia Complex"], "id": "NCT00002209"}
