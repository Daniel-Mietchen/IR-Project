This study will compare KAV, the drug venlafaxine-XR (VEN), and placebo for the treatment of GAD. This study will last 10 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive KAV, VEN, or placebo for 8 weeks. Participants will then undergo a 1-week tapering of their medication followed by an additional week of observation. Self-report scales and questionnaires will be used to assess the anxiety, depression, and functional impairment of participants. Side effects, vital signs, and laboratory measures will be monitored throughout the study.", "condition": ["Anxiety Disorders"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Venlafaxine ER", "Sugar pill", "Kava"], "description": ["75 to 225 mg daily", "Upto 3 per day for venlafainxe and 4 per day for kava placebos.", "140 to 280 mg per day"], "arm_group_label": ["active antidepressant drug comparator", "active antidepressant drug comparator", "Sugar pill", "Herbal treatment kava", "Herbal treatment kava"], "other_name": ["Effexor XR", "No brand name", "No brand name"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "Medicine, Herbal", "mesh_term": ["Anxiety Disorders", "Venlafaxine Hydrochloride"], "id": "NCT00083980"}
