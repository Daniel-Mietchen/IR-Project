{"brief_title": "Pilot Study of High-Concentration Capsaicin Patches in the Treatment of Painful HIV-Associated Neuropathy", "brief_summary": "The purpose of the study is to gain initial information on the tolerability and feasibility of high-concentration capsaicin patches for the treatment of painful HIV-associated neuropathy, whether resulting from HIV disease and/or antiretroviral drug exposure. The study will also provide preliminary safety and efficacy information.", "condition": ["HIV Infections"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Capsaicin Dermal Patch"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Between 18 and 75 years of age. - Documented evidence of HIV-1 infection. - Painful HIV-associated neuropathy, whether resulting from HIV disease and/or antiretroviral drug exposure, with primary symptoms of pain, burning or dysesthetic discomfort in both feet for at least 2 months prior to Screening Visit. AND: - Diminished ankle reflexes (compared to the knee) or absent ankle reflexes, AND/OR - Distal diminution of either vibration sensation or pain or temperature sensation in the legs. - Either no neurotoxic antiretroviral (i.e., didanosine [ddI], zalcitabine [ddC], or stavudine [d4T]) exposure for at least 8 weeks prior to Screening Visit, OR - Currently on stable dose(s) of any of the neurotoxic antiretrovirals listed above for at least 8 weeks prior to Screening Visit, without a foreseeable need to change doses or medications for duration of study. - Screening Pain Sum Score of 12 to 36. - Intact, unbroken skin over the painful area(s) to be treated. - If taking chronic pain medications, be on a stable (not PRN) regimen for at least 7 days prior to Treatment Visit (Day 0) and willing to maintain medications at same stable dose(s) and schedule throughout the study. - Be willing and able to use Roxicodone\u00ae (oxycodone) oral solution, if needed, to relieve treatment-associated discomfort. - Female subjects with child-bearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test, to be performed at the Screening Visit. - All subjects must be willing to use effective methods of birth control and/or refrain from participating in a conception process during the study and for 30 days following experimental drug exposure. - Be willing and able to comply with protocol requirements for the duration of study participation. (Such requirements include, but are not limited to: completing a daily pain diary, attending all study visits, and refraining from extensive travel during study participation.) Exclusion Criteria: - Presence of acute, active opportunistic infection, except oral thrush; oral, genital, or rectal herpes; and Mycobacterium avium bacteremia within 2 weeks prior to Screening Visit. - Significant pain of an etiology other than painful HIV-associated neuropathy, for example, compression-related neuropathies, e.g., spinal stenosis, or fibromyalgia or arthritis. Subjects must not have significant ongoing pain from other cause(s) that may interfere with judging HIV-associated neuropathy pain. - Evidence of another contributing cause for peripheral neuropathy, e.g., diabetes mellitus, hereditary neuropathy, vitamin B12 deficiency (B12 level less than or equal to 200 pg/mL) or less than 3 months of B12 supplementation prior to Screening Visit, or treatment within 90 days prior to Screening Visit with any drug that may have contributed to the sensory neuropathy. - Any implanted medical device (spinal cord stimulator, intrathecal pump or peripheral nerve stimulator) for the treatment of neuropathic pain. - Recent use (within 21 days preceding the Treatment Visit [Day 0]) of any topically applied pain medication, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, menthol, methyl salicylate, local anesthetics (including Lidoderm\u00ae), steroids or capsaicin products on the painful areas. - Treatment for acute opportunistic infections within 14 days before Treatment Visit (Day 0). Maintenance treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis, Mycobacterium avium bacteremia, or cryptococcal meningitis is permitted. - Current use of any investigational drug, or Class 1 anti-arrhythmic drugs (such as tocainide and mexiletine). - Hypersensitivity to capsaicin (i.e., chili peppers or OTC capsaicin products), local anesthetics, Roxicodone or adhesives. - Significant ongoing or untreated abnormalities in cardiac, renal, hepatic, or pulmonary function that may interfere either with the ability to complete the study or the evaluation of adverse events. - Currently have active malignant disease. Malignancies in remission that do not require further treatment or Kaposi's sarcoma requiring local treatment only are allowed. - High tolerance to opioids that precludes the ability to relieve treatment-associated discomfort with Roxicodone\u00ae if needed, as judged by investigator. - History or current problem with prescription drug, illicit substance, or alcohol abuse from self report or as judged by investigator.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "75 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "Pain", "mesh_term": ["HIV Infections", "Capsaicin"], "id": "NCT00061152"}
