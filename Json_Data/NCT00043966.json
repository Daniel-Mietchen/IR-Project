Subjects who are on stable maintenance therapy for an opportunistic infection may be enrolled after consultation with Abbott. - Subject is naive to antiretroviral treatment (< 7 days ARV treatment). - Subject has a plasma HIV RNA level of greater than 1,000 copies/mL at screening. - Subject agrees to take all doses of the lopinavir/ritonavir from the bottles provided by the sponsor (rather than take doses from a personal \u201cdosette\u201d box). - Subject has voluntarily signed and dated an informed consent form, approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC), after the nature of the study has been explained and the subject has had the opportunity to ask questions. The informed consent must be signed before any study-specific procedures are performed. Exclusion Criteria: - Subject has a history of an allergic reaction or significant sensitivity to lopinavir/ritonavir, tenofovir or emtricitabine or to drugs similar to study drug. - Subject has a recent (within the past 6 months) history of drug and/or alcohol abuse. - Subject has a positive result on the screening tests for drugs of abuse. - Subject has a history of substance abuse or psychiatric illness that could preclude adherence with the protocol. - Screening laboratory analyses show any of the following abnormal laboratory results: *Hemoglobin \u2264 8.0 g/dL *Absolute neutrophil count \u2264 750 cells/\u00b5L *Platelet count \u2264 50,000 per mL *ALT or AST \u2265 3.0 x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) *Creatinine \u2265 1.5 x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) - Subject has received any investigational drug within 30 days prior to study drug administration. - For any reason, subject is considered by the investigator to be an unsuitable candidate for the study.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "treatment naive", "mesh_term": ["HIV Infections", "Ritonavir", "Lopinavir", "Emtricitabine", "Tenofovir"], "id": "NCT00043966"}
