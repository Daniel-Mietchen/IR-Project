{"brief_title": "Arsenic Trioxide in Treating Patients With Multiple Myeloma", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of arsenic trioxide in treating patients who have relapsed or refractory stage II or stage III multiple myeloma.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate of patients with relapsed or refractory stage II or III multiple myeloma treated with arsenic trioxide. II. Determine the overall and relapse-free survival rates of patients treated with this drug. III. Determine the safety profile of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV on days 1-5 and 8-12. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses. Patients are followed at 4 weeks after the last treatment dose. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 55 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Multiple Myeloma and Plasma Cell Neoplasm"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["arsenic trioxide"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Diagnosis of multiple myeloma Stage II or III (Durie-Salmon) Relapsed or refractory to conventional therapy No monoclonal gammopathy or indolent or smoldering myeloma Measurable disease by serum and urine M protein and/or plasmacytoma PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: Over 18 Performance status: Karnofsky 70-100% Life expectancy: 3 months Hematopoietic: Granulocyte count greater than 1,200/mm3 Platelet count greater than 100,000/mm3 Hemoglobin greater than 10 g/dL Hepatic: Bilirubin less than 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) SGOT/SGPT less than 2 times ULN Renal: Creatinine no greater than 2.5 mg/dL Cardiovascular: Absolute QT interval less than 460 msec in the presence of normal potassium and magnesium levels PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: At least 28 days since prior biologic therapy Chemotherapy: No more than 3 prior chemotherapy regimens, including no more than 2 cytotoxic regimens AND 1 high-dose cytotoxic regimen as part of stem cell transplantation Endocrine therapy: At least 28 days since prior endocrine therapy Radiotherapy: At least 28 days since prior radiotherapy (except for focal radiotherapy for symptom control) Surgery: Not specified", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "stage III multiple myeloma", "mesh_term": ["Multiple Myeloma", "Neoplasms, Plasma Cell", "Plasmacytoma", "Arsenic trioxide"], "id": "NCT00017433"}
