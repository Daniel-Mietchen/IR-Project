{"brief_title": "Reduced Intensity Donor Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplant in Treating Patients With De Novo or Secondary Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Remission", "brief_summary": "This phase II trial studies how well reduced intensity donor peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplant works in treating patients with de novo or secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in remission. Giving low doses of chemotherapy, such as fludarabine phosphate, and total-body irradiation (TBI) before a donor PBSC transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil after the transplant may stop this from happening", "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine if a one-year disease free survival of >= 35% can be achieved among patients >= 55 years old with de novo and secondary AML in first complete remission (CR1) who undergo nonmyeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) from human leukocyte antigen (HLA) identical related donors. II. To determine if a day +200 nonrelapse related mortality of < 15% can be achieved among patients >= 55 years old with de novo and secondary AML in CR1 who undergo nonmyeloablative HSCT from HLA identical related donors. OUTLINE: CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) on days -4 to -2 and undergo TBI on day 0. TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo allogeneic PBSC transplant on day 0. IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive cyclosporine (CSP) orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -3 to 56 with taper to day 77. Patients also receive mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) PO BID on days 0-27. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up on days 28, 56, and 84; months 6, 12, 18, and 24; and then yearly for 5 years.", "condition": ["Acute Myeloid Leukemia With Multilineage Dysplasia Following Myelodysplastic Syndrome", "Adult Acute Megakaryoblastic Leukemia (M7)", "Adult Acute Minimally Differentiated Myeloid Leukemia (M0)", "Adult Acute Monoblastic Leukemia (M5a)", "Adult Acute Monocytic Leukemia (M5b)", "Adult Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia With Maturation (M2)", "Adult Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia Without Maturation (M1)", "Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Remission", "Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia With 11q23 (MLL) Abnormalities", "Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia With Del(5q)", "Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia With Inv(16)(p13;q22)", "Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia With t(16;16)(p13;q22)", "Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia With t(8;21)(q22;q22)", "Adult Acute Myelomonocytic Leukemia (M4)", "Adult Erythroleukemia (M6a)", "Adult Pure Erythroid Leukemia (M6b)", "Secondary Acute Myeloid Leukemia"], "intervention_type": ["Procedure", "Drug", "Radiation", "Drug", "Drug", "Procedure"], "intervention_name": ["nonmyeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation", "fludarabine phosphate", "total-body irradiation", "cyclosporine", "mycophenolate mofetil", "peripheral blood stem cell transplantation"], "description": ["Undergo nonmyeloablative allogeneic PBSC transplant", "Given IV", "Undergo TBI", "Given PO", "Given PO", "Undergo nonmyeloablative allogeneic PBSC transplant"], "arm_group_label": ["Treatment (nonmyeloablative donor PBSC transplant)", "Treatment (nonmyeloablative donor PBSC transplant)", "Treatment (nonmyeloablative donor PBSC transplant)", "Treatment (nonmyeloablative donor PBSC transplant)", "Treatment (nonmyeloablative donor PBSC transplant)", "Treatment (nonmyeloablative donor PBSC transplant)"], "other_name": ["2-F-ara-AMP", "Beneflur", "Fludara", "TBI", "ciclosporin", "cyclosporin", "cyclosporin A", "CYSP", "Sandimmune", "Cellcept", "MMF", "PBPC transplantation", "PBSC transplantation", "peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation", "transplantation, peripheral blood stem cell"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Patients with de novo AML (French-American-British [FAB] MO-M2, M4-M7) or secondary AML who achieve CR1 after induction chemotherapy and one or two cycles of consolidation chemotherapy - Transplant conditioning must occur within 6 months of diagnosis - Patient enrollment must be approved by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) principal investigator (PI) or the PI's designee - DONOR: Related donor who is genotypically or phenotypically identical - DONOR: Age >= 12 years - DONOR: Donor must consent to filgrastim (G-CSF) administration and leukapheresis - DONOR: Donor must have adequate veins for leukapheresis or agree to placement of central venous catheter (femoral, subclavian) Exclusion Criteria: - AML FAB M3 - AML involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) as defined by a positive cytospin of cerebral spinal fluid at the time of enrollment - Presence of circulating leukemic blasts (in the peripheral blood) detected by standard pathology - Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositivity - Fungal infections with radiographic progression after receipt of amphotericin B or active triazole for greater than one month - Diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) corrected < 40% - Total lung capacity (TLC) < 40% - Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) < 40% or requiring supplementary oxygen - The FHCRC principal investigator of the study must approve enrollment of all patients with pulmonary nodules - Cardiac ejection fraction < 40% - Patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of liver disease would be evaluated for the cause of liver disease, its clinical severity in terms of liver function, bridging fibrosis, and the degree of portal hypertension;
