Objectives: The objectives of this study were to 1) test whether a health care provider-directed intervention increased colorectal cancer screening rates in an urban VA medical center and 2) evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Methods: The study was a randomized controlled trial, conducted at two clinic firms at a VA Medical Center in Chicago. Eligible patients were men, age 50 and older, had no personal or family history of colorectal cancer or polyps, had not received colorectal cancer screening, and had at least one visit to the clinic during the study period. Health care providers in the intervention firm attended a workshop on colorectal cancer screening. Every 4-6 months they attended quality improvement workshops where they received group screening rates, individualized confidential feedback, and training on improving communication with patients with limited literacy skills. Medical records were reviewed for colorectal cancer screening recommendations and completion. Literacy level was assessed in a subset of patients. In the cost-effectiveness analysis, resource and cost estimates were derived.
