{"brief_title": "The Safety and Effectiveness of a Two-Drug Combination in the Treatment of Patients With Hepatitis C Plus Advanced HIV Infections", "brief_summary": "To investigate the toxicity of interferon alfa-2b ( IFN alfa-2b ) in combination with nucleoside analog therapy in HIV-positive patients with chronic hepatitis C. To determine the efficacy of treatment with IFN alfa-2b for chronic hepatitis C in patients with advanced HIV infections treated with nucleoside analog therapy. IFN alfa-2b has HIV inhibitory properties and has also been approved for treatment of chronic hepatitis C. Studies have shown that IFN alfa-2b is effective in asymptomatic HIV-positive patients with chronic hepatitis C, but the drug's benefit against hepatitis C in patients with advanced HIV infection has not been determined.", "detailed_description": "IFN alfa-2b has HIV inhibitory properties and has also been approved for treatment of chronic hepatitis C. Studies have shown that IFN alfa-2b is effective in asymptomatic HIV-positive patients with chronic hepatitis C, but the drug's benefit against hepatitis C in patients with advanced HIV infection has not been determined. Patients receive interferon alpha-2b subcutaneously 3 times weekly for 6 months. If no response is seen after 18 weeks of therapy or if an initial response is followed by relapse while on therapy, dose is increased. Patients who require a dose escalation should continue on IFN alfa-2b for an additional 6 months. All patients will also receive available nucleoside analog therapy ( zidovudine, didanosine, zalcitabine ) at currently accepted doses as clinically appropriate.", "condition": ["HIV Infections", "Hepatitis C"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Interferon alfa-2b", "Zidovudine", "Zalcitabine", "Didanosine"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria Concurrent Medication: Allowed: - Treatment or suppression of opportunistic infections with standard drugs. - Pneumovax, HIB, tetanus, influenza, and hepatitis B vaccines. - Clinically indicated antibiotics. - Short courses of steroids (< 21 days) for acute problems not related to hepatitis C. - Other regularly prescribed medications such as analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, antipyretics, allergy medications, and oral contraceptives.
