{"brief_title": "Effectiveness and Safety of Two Forms of Stavudine in HIV-Infected Patients", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of 2 forms of stavudine (d4T). One form is taken once a day (extended release) and the other form is taken twice a day (immediate release).", "detailed_description": "Patients are randomized to receive blinded stavudine extended release (d4T ER) or immediate release (d4T IR) formulation. Randomization is balanced by screening HIV viral load of less than 30,000 copies/ml or at least 30,000 copies/ml and by site. Patients also receive open-label efavirenz (EFV) and lamivudine (3TC). Efficacy is evaluated over 48 weeks of the dosing period and safety is evaluated over the entire dosing period (56 weeks).", "condition": ["HIV Infections"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Efavirenz", "Lamivudine", "Stavudine"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria Patients may be eligible for this study if they: - Are at least 18 years old.
