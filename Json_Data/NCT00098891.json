{"brief_title": "MS-275 and Isotretinoin in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Advanced Solid Tumors or Lymphomas", "brief_summary": "Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining MS-275 with isotretinoin in treating patients who have metastatic or advanced solid tumors or lymphomas. MS-275 may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth. Isotretinoin may help cancer cells develop into normal cells. MS-275 may increase the effectiveness of isotretinoin by making cancer cells more sensitive to the drug. MS-275 and isotretinoin may also stop the growth of solid tumors or lymphomas by stopping blood flow to the cancer. Combining MS-275 with isotretinoin may kill more cancer cells", "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of MS-275 when administered with isotretinoin in patients with metastatic, progressive, refractory, or unresectable solid tumors or lymphomas. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine, preliminarily, tumor response in patients treated with this regimen. II. Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of MS-275. Patients receive oral MS-275 once on days 1, 8, and 15 and oral isotretinoin twice daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of MS-275 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Up to 12 patients are treated at the MTD. Patients are followed monthly.", "condition": ["Adult Grade III Lymphomatoid Granulomatosis", "Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma", "Angioimmunoblastic T-cell Lymphoma", "Extranodal Marginal Zone B-cell Lymphoma of Mucosa-associated Lymphoid Tissue", "Intraocular Lymphoma", "Nodal Marginal Zone B-cell Lymphoma", "Primary Central Nervous System Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Burkitt Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Diffuse Mixed Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Diffuse Small Cleaved Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Grade III Lymphomatoid Granulomatosis", "Recurrent Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Immunoblastic Large Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult Lymphoblastic Lymphoma", "Recurrent Adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma", "Recurrent Cutaneous T-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Recurrent Grade 1 Follicular Lymphoma", "Recurrent Grade 2 Follicular Lymphoma", "Recurrent Grade 3 Follicular Lymphoma", "Recurrent Mantle Cell Lymphoma", "Recurrent Marginal Zone Lymphoma", "Recurrent Mycosis Fungoides/Sezary Syndrome", "Recurrent Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma", "Small Intestine Lymphoma", "Splenic Marginal Zone Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Burkitt Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Diffuse Mixed Cell Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Diffuse Small Cleaved Cell Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Immunoblastic Large Cell Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult Lymphoblastic Lymphoma", "Stage IV Adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma", "Stage IV Cutaneous T-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Stage IV Grade 1 Follicular Lymphoma", "Stage IV Grade 2 Follicular Lymphoma", "Stage IV Grade 3 Follicular Lymphoma", "Stage IV Mantle Cell Lymphoma", "Stage IV Marginal Zone Lymphoma", "Stage IV Mycosis Fungoides/Sezary Syndrome", "Stage IV Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma", "Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific", "Waldenstr\u00f6m Macroglobulinemia"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["entinostat", "isotretinoin"], "description": ["Given orally", "Given orally"], "arm_group_label": ["Treatment (entinostat, isotretinoin)", "Treatment (entinostat, isotretinoin)"], "other_name": ["HDAC inhibitor SNDX-275", "SNDX-275", "13-CRA", "Amnesteem", "Cistane", "Claravis", "Sotret"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: -
