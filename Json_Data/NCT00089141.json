{"brief_title": "Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) for Treatment of Chronic Graft-versus-host Disease (GVHD)", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Mycophenolate mofetil added to immunosuppressive treatment regimens may be effective in treating newly diagnosed chronic graft-versus-host disease caused by stem cell transplantation. It is not yet known whether immunosuppressive treatment regimens are more effective with or without mycophenolate mofetil in treating chronic graft-versus-host disease. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying whether the addition of mycophenolate mofetil improves the efficacy of immunosuppressive treatment regimens in patients with newly diagnosed chronic graft-versus-host disease.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Compare the efficacy of immunosuppressive treatment regimens with vs without mycophenolate mofetil in patients with newly diagnosed chronic graft-vs-host disease. - Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prospective, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to organ involvement of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (single organ vs multiple organs) and transplant center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. All patients receive usual therapy for chronic GVHD comprising oral prednisone twice daily and oral cyclosporine, oral tacrolimus or oral sirolimus twice daily until 2 weeks after the first evidence of improvement of symptoms of chronic GVHD. - Arm I: Patients receive oral mycophenolate mofetil twice daily. - Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily. In both arms administration of the study drug continues for 3 months after completion of prednisone and cyclosporine, tacrolimus or sirolimus in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then every 3 months. Patients are followed every 3 months for 3-5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 230 patients (115 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 3 years.", "condition": "Cancer", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "placebo", "description": "Given orally", "arm_group_label": "Placebo", "other_name": "Control", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Newly diagnosed chronic-graft-versus host disease (GVHD) - Systemic immunosuppressive treatment indicated AND no contraindication to treatment with mycophenolate mofetil - Has undergone prior transplantation with any type of donor, hematopoietic stem cell graft, or conditioning regimen - No clinical, laboratory, or image-based evidence known to be present at the time of enrollment and indicating a high probability of subsequent recurrent or progressive disease PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - Any age Performance status - Not specified Life expectancy - Not specified Hematopoietic - Absolute neutrophil count \u2265 1,500/mm^3 Hepatic - Not specified Renal - Not specified Pulmonary - No known bronchiolitis obliterans as a manifestation of chronic GVHD Immunologic - No fungal infection without radiographic evidence of improvement during continued antifungal therapy - No cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia without major radiographic evidence of improvement - No other CMV infection without reduction of antigenemia or viral load during continued antiviral therapy - No active disseminated varicella zoster viral infection - No known hypersensitivity or allergy to MMF Gastrointestinal - Able to tolerate oral medication - No lactose-intolerant children who are too young to swallow capsules - No frank blood from the rectum - No melena - No known gastrointestinal ulceration Other - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception - Female patients must use 2 forms of contraception 4 weeks prior to, during, and for 6 weeks after completion of study treatment - Not hospitalized at time of enrollment - No rare, hereditary deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase (HGPRT) PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - See Disease Characteristics Chemotherapy - Not specified Endocrine therapy - Prior treatment with prednisone or equivalent allowed provided the dose was \u2264 1.0 mg/kg/day at the time of enrollment - Concurrent systemic glucocorticoids allowed Radiotherapy - Not specified Surgery - Not specified Other - Prior mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for prevention or treatment of acute GVHD allowed provided MMF was discontinued at least 2 weeks before the diagnosis of chronic GVHD was made - No prior systemic treatment for chronic GVHD - No prior treatment for chronic GVHD - Concurrent antacids allowed provided there is at least a 2-hour interval before and after administration of MMF - No other concurrent systemic immunosuppressive treatment except cyclosporine, tacrolimus or sirolimus", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "4 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00089141.xml"}
