{"brief_title": "Radiation Therapy Using 3-Dimensional Treatment Planning in Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Computer systems that allow doctors to create a 3-dimensional picture of the tumor in order to plan treatment may result in more effective radiation therapy. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of high-dose radiation therapy planned using a 3-dimensional picture of the tumor in treating patients who have stage I, stage II, or stage III non-small cell lung cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum dose of external beam irradiation deliverable using conformal 3-dimensional treatment planning in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. - Determine the feasibility and efficacy of 3-dimensional treatment planning in delivering high doses of external beam radiotherapy to these patients. - Determine whether computer-generated dose-volume histograms and normal tissue complication probability models can predict the degree of pulmonary toxicity resulting from external beam radiotherapy. - Determine the relationship between dose of external beam radiotherapy and the degree of pulmonary function change. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients undergo 3-dimensional conformal external beam radiotherapy 5 days a week for 8-10 weeks. Cohorts of 10 patients receive escalating doses of radiotherapy until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which no more than 20% of patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 1 month and then every 4 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60-70 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.", "condition": ["Lung Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Radiation"], "intervention_name": ["radiation therapy"], "arm_group_label": ["external beam radiotherapy"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically or cytologically confirmed non-small cell lung cancer - Clinical stage T1-4, N0-2, M0 - Clinical stage T1-2, N0-1 must be medically inoperable - No distant metastases on history and physical exam, CBC, screening profile, CT or MRI of brain, CT of chest and abdomen (including adrenals and liver), and bone scan - No pleural effusions - Atelectasis not clearly distinguishable from tumor mass allowed provided all tumor and atelectasis together represent a volume that can be safely treated to the total dose delivered to gross disease - Diffuse pulmonary infiltrates thought to represent benign disease allowed only if representative lesion samples are proven by biopsy or cytology not to contain cancer - No diffuse bronchoalveolar carcinoma PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 and over Performance status: - Karnofsky 70-100% Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - Not specified Hepatic: - Not specified Renal: - Not specified Other: - No other malignancy within the past 5 years except nonmelanomatous skin cancer or noninvasive cervical carcinoma - No other medical illness that cannot be adequately controlled with appropriate therapy or that is considered severe enough to preclude a radical treatment approach PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - No prior biologic therapy for lung cancer Chemotherapy - No prior chemotherapy for lung cancer Endocrine therapy - No prior endocrine therapy for lung cancer Radiotherapy - No prior radiotherapy for lung cancer Surgery - No prior surgery for lung cancer", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer", "mesh_term": ["Lung Neoplasms", "Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung"], "id": "NCT00002484"}
