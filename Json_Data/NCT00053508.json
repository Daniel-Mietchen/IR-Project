{"brief_title": "Dose Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of a New Smallpox Vaccine in Adults Without Previous Smallpox Vaccination", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and the effectiveness of a new vaccine for the prevention of the disease, smallpox.", "detailed_description": "In addition to assessment of safety parameters, the objective of this study is to determine the minimum dose of ACAM1000 that is calculated to produce a major cutaneous reaction in at least 90% of a population of healthy adults 18-29 years of age and na\u00efve to smallpox vaccine. Specifically, the objectives of this study are to: 1. Compare the safety and tolerability of three dose levels of ACAM1000 and a standard dose of Dryvax\u00ae in healthy adults 18-29 years of age and na\u00efve to smallpox vaccine. Safety and tolerability will be determined by examination of the local cutaneous reaction, adverse events, physical examinations, vital signs, structured interviews, and laboratory analysis. 2. Determine the immunogenicity of three dose levels of ACAM1000 and a standard dose of Dryvax\u00ae in healthy adults 18-29 years of age by comparing: (a)the proportion of subjects at each dose level who develop a major cutaneous reaction; (b)the proportion of subjects in each treatment group who develop neutralizing antibodies, including the fold-increase in antibody titer between Baseline and Day 30 sera; and the geometric mean vaccinia neutralizing antibody titer on Day 30. 3. Determine the minimum dose of ACAM1000 that is calculated to produce a major cutaneous reaction in at least 90% of a population of healthy adults 18-29 years of age and na\u00efve to smallpox vaccine.", "condition": ["Smallpox"], "intervention_type": ["Biological", "Biological"], "intervention_name": ["ACAM1000", "vaccinia virus (calf lymph) smallpox vaccine: Dryvax"], "description": ["Group 1 dose: 1.4 x 10-8th PFU/ml (350,000 PFU) Group 2 dose: 2.8 x 10-7th PFU/ml (70,000 PFU) Group 3 dose: 5.6 x 10-6th PFU/ml (14,000 PFU)", "group 4 dose: 1.6 x 10-8th PFU/ml (250,000 PFU)"], "arm_group_label": ["Group 1", "Group 2", "Group 3", "Group 4"], "other_name": ["brand name = Dryvax"], "criteria": "Inclusion criteria: - in good general health. - not pregnant and using effective birth control - agreed to participate in entire study and comply with protocol requirements.
