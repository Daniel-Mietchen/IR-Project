{"brief_title": "Single-Dose Local Radiation Therapy Compared With Ibandronate in Treating Patients With Localized Metastatic Bone Pain", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Ibandronate may be effective in reducing bone pain caused by metastatic cancer. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. It is not yet known whether ibandronate is more effective than standard treatment with radiation therapy in treating metastatic bone pain. PURPOSE: This phase III randomized clinical trial is studying ibandronate to see how well it works compared to single-dose local radiation therapy in treating patients with localized metastatic bone pain.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare pain response at 4 and 12 weeks post-treatment in patients with localized metastatic bone pain treated with single-dose ibandronate vs single-dose local radiotherapy . Secondary - Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens. - Correlate urinary markers of osteoclast activity (pyridinoline and deoxypyridinoline) with the clinical outcome of patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, crossover, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to primary tumor type and participating center. Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive a single dose of local radiotherapy to the site of pain (8Gy/1f). - Arm II: Patients receive a single dose of ibandronate IV over 15 minutes. Patients who do not achieve a partial or complete response at 4 weeks crossover to the alternate arm. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then at 4 and 12 weeks. Pain is assessed at baseline, at 4, 8, and 12 weeks, and then at 6 months. Patients are followed at 4, 8, and 12 weeks and then at 6 and 12 months. Peer Reviewed and Funded or Endorsed by Cancer Research UK PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 470 patients (235 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Metastatic Cancer", "Pain", "Prostate Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["ibandronate sodium"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically or cytologically confirmed primary prostate cancer OR sclerotic bone metastases (for patients with serum prostate-specific antigen > 100 ng/mL) - Radiologically confirmed bone metastases by plain x-ray, isotope scan, CT scan, or MRI - Clinical diagnosis of metastatic bone pain for which radiotherapy is indicated - Single localized metastatic bone pain AND receiving optimal analgesics and adjuvant drugs, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, unless contraindicated - Hormone receptor status: - Not specified PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - Over 18 Sex - Male Menopausal status - Not specified Performance status - Not specified Life expectancy - At least 3 months Hematopoietic - Not specified Hepatic - Not specified Renal - Creatinine \u2264 3.0 mg/dL - No hypercalcemia (corrected calcium > 10.8 mg/dL) - No hypocalcemia (corrected calcium < 8.2 mg/dL) Other - No known hypersensitivity to ibandronate or other bisphosphonates - No history of aspirin-sensitive asthma - Able to comply with pain chart and quality of life assessments PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - Not specified Chemotherapy - More than 4 weeks since prior change in systemic chemotherapy - No prior high-dose chemotherapy (dose intensity > 3 times standard dose) Endocrine therapy - More than 4 weeks since prior change in hormonal therapy Radiotherapy - See Disease Characteristics - No prior external beam radiotherapy to index site - No prior systemic radioisotope therapy (e.g., strontium chloride Sr 89 or samarium Sm 153 lexidronam pentasodium) Surgery - Not specified Other - More than 6 months since prior bisphosphonate treatment - More than 4 weeks since prior aminoglycoside antibiotics - More than 30 days since prior investigational drugs", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "recurrent prostate cancer", "mesh_term": ["Prostatic Neoplasms", "Neoplasm Metastasis", "Ibandronic acid", "Diphosphonates"], "id": "NCT00082927"}
