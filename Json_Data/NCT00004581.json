{"brief_title": "A Study to Compare Two Anti-HIV Drug Combinations in HIV-Infected Patients Who Have Previously Received Anti-HIV Treatment", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of 2 anti-HIV drug combinations in HIV-infected patients. Both combinations will include nevirapine (NVP), 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), and at least 1 protease inhibitor (PI). One combination will include a new protease inhibitor, ABT-378, combined in a capsule with ritonavir (RTV).", "detailed_description": "Patients receive 1 of the following: 1. ABT-378/RTV plus NVP plus 2 NRTIs; or 2.

Exclusion Criteria Patients will not be eligible for this study if they: - Have an active illness. - Have received treatment for any active opportunistic (AIDS-related) infection within 30 days of study entry. - Have ever received a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). - Have received investigational (not yet approved by the FDA) drugs within 30 days of study entry. - Have received treatment with a PI other than their current PI. - Are receiving chemotherapy for cancer. - Are pregnant or breast-feeding.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "12 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "ABT 378", "mesh_term": ["HIV Infections", "Ritonavir", "Lopinavir", "HIV Protease Inhibitors", "Nevirapine", "Protease Inhibitors", "Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors"], "id": "NCT00004581"}
