{"brief_title": "Randomized Study of Succimer (Dimercaptosuccinic Acid) on Growth of Lead-Poisoned Children", "brief_summary": "OBJECTIVES: Compare growth of lead-poisoned children receiving succimer (dimercaptosuccinic acid; DMSA) plus standard treatment to those receiving standard treatment only.", "detailed_description": "PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is randomized study. Patients are randomized to receive succimer in addition to standard treatment (arm I) or standard treatment only (arm II). Succimer is administered orally 3 times a day for 7 days, then twice daily for 19 days. Patients may receive up to 3 courses. Standard treatment consists of a medical history and physical examination, environmental assessment with modification to reduce lead exposure, dietary modifications to decrease lead absorption, the use of a daily multivitamin and mineral supplement with iron, developmental screening and intervention, and frequent follow up of lead levels. If blood lead level rises above 45 mcg/dL, patient receives succimer regardless of treatment arm originally assigned. Patients are followed every 3-4 weeks for 2 months, then every 3 months for 6 months, and then every 6 months thereafter.", "condition": "Lead Poisoning", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "succimer", "criteria": "PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA: --Disease Characteristics-- Asymptomatic children with confirmed venous blood lead of at least 20 mcg/dL and less than 45 mcg/dL Children with blood lead of 45 mcg/dL or greater are not randomized in this study since they probably will receive succimer regardless of being enrolled in this study --Patient Characteristics-- Other: No contraindications to the use of succimer (i.e., allergy or a lack of lead safe environment in which to live during chelation)", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "6 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00004838.xml"}
