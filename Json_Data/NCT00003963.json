{"brief_title": "Chemotherapy and Monoclonal Antibody Therapy in Treating Patients With B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma That Has Relapsed Following Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining monoclonal antibody therapy with chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of the monoclonal antibody rituximab plus chemotherapy with vinorelbine in treating patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that has relapsed following autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the tolerability and toxicity of rituximab combined with vinorelbine in patients with relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma following autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. - Assess the response rate and duration of response to this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive rituximab IV weekly on weeks 1-4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 and vinorelbine IV on weeks 2-4, 6-8, and 10-12. Patients who achieve partial response may continue on vinorelbine from week 14 until disease progression. Patients are followed until disease progression. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-25 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Lymphoma"], "intervention_type": ["Biological", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["rituximab", "vinorelbine ditartrate"], "description": ["Week 1-4: Rituxan is given at 375 mg/m2 weekly x4.
