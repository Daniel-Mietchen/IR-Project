{"brief_title": "Study of a Drug [DCVax (tm)-Prostate] to Treat Prostate Cancer When Hormone Therapy is no Longer Effective.", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this clinical research study is to assess the safety and efficacy of an investigational therapy called DCVax(TM)-Prostate.", "detailed_description": "Patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer are eligible if they have a rising PSA or three or fewer metastatic lesions. The experimental therapy uses a patient's own white blood cells and \"teaches\" the cells to recognize a \"flag\" on prostate cancer cells. This may help the immune system destroy prostate cancer cells. Side effects reported from the Phase I/II trial include skin reactions of redness, pain & swelling at the injection site, and short-lived headache, fever & fatigue. Full details are available in the informed consent.", "condition": ["Prostate Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Dendritic cell immunotherapy"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria - Hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) &#8211; progressive disease despite androgen deprivation and serum testosterone <50ng/dL; progression defined as either: 1. Rising PSA over 6 months with at least a 50% increase between the 1st and 3rd measurement, and the 3rd measurement >2.0 ng/ml; or 2. Progression of metastatic lesion on bone scan, or 3. Progression of lymph node metastasis by CT scan. - Zubrod or ECOG performance status of 0-1. - Three or fewer bone metastases on a bone scan with minimal symptoms. - No lymph node lesions greater than 3.0 cm at longest diameter. - Adequate hematological, hepatic and renal function.
