{"brief_title": "PS-341 in Treating Patients With Metastatic Neuroendocrine Tumors", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of PS-341 in treating patients who have metastatic neuroendocrine tumors.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the objective response rate of patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors treated with bortezomib. - Determine the toxicity of this drug in this patient population. - Determine the pharmacodynamics to correlate proteasome inhibition and efficacy of this drug in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Treatment repeats every 21 days for at least 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses beyond CR. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 months.", "condition": ["Gastrointestinal Carcinoid Tumor", "Islet Cell Tumor"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["bortezomib"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed metastatic carcinoid tumor or islet cell tumor - Well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor OR - Well-differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma - Measurable disease in at least 1 dimension - At least 20 mm by conventional techniques OR at least 10 mm by spiral CT scan - The following are considered nonmeasurable: - Lesions in a previously irradiated area - Bone lesions - Leptomeningeal disease - Ascites - Pleural/pericardial effusion - Lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis - Abdominal masses that are not confirmed and followed - Cystic lesions PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 and over Performance status: - ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy: - At least 6 months Hematopoietic: - Leukocyte count at least 3,000/mm^3 - Absolute neutrophil count at least 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 100,000/mm^3 Hepatic: - Bilirubin no greater than 1.5 mg/dL - AST/ALT no greater than 2.5 times upper limit of normal Renal: - Creatinine no greater than 1.5 mg/dL Cardiovascular: - No symptomatic congestive heart failure - No unstable angina pectoris - No cardiac arrhythmia Other: - No other uncontrolled illness - No ongoing active infection - No psychiatric illness or social situation that would preclude study - No history of allergic reaction to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to bortezomib - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - At least 4 weeks since prior immunotherapy (interferon alfa) Chemotherapy: - No more than 1 prior systemic chemotherapy regimen (except hepatic artery chemoembolization) - At least 4 weeks since prior systemic chemotherapy (6 weeks for nitrosoureas) - At least 12 weeks since prior hepatic artery chemoembolization (unless liver lesions are not indicator lesions) - Stable dose long-acting octreotide therapy (Sandostatin LAR) within the past 3 months allowed - Concurrent subcutaneous octreotide for breakthrough symptomatic relief allowed Endocrine therapy: - Not specified Radiotherapy: - See Disease Characteristics - At least 4 weeks since prior radiotherapy Surgery: - Not specified Other: - No other concurrent investigational agents, commercial agents, or therapies - No concurrent combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-positive patients", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "glucagonoma", "mesh_term": ["Neoplasms", "Neuroendocrine Tumors", "Carcinoid Tumor", "Malignant Carcinoid Syndrome", "Gastrointestinal Neoplasms", "Adenoma, Islet Cell", "Bortezomib"], "id": "NCT00017199"}
