{"brief_title": "Relationship Training for Children With Autism and Their Peers", "brief_summary": "This study will determine whether peer interaction training interventions are effective in enhancing the social relationships of children with autism.", "detailed_description": "Children with autism often have poor relationships with other children during their childhood and through their adult lives. A number of peer-related intervention models have been developed, but these models have not been thoroughly reviewed or implemented within the school setting. This study will examine the social inclusion of children with autism, following different peer-related interventions training children with autism and their peers. Children will be randomly assigned to one of four interventions that comprise all autistic children, all nonautistic children, or a mixed group of both. The first intervention focuses on improving the social skills of autistic children. The second intervention involves educating the peers of autistic children to increase their acceptance of their autistic peers. The third intervention is a combination of the first two interventions. Children assigned to the fourth intervention will receive the usual training offered in their local school districts. Training for each group will be conducted twice a week for 6 weeks. Characteristics of the autistic child will be assessed through an interview that evaluates intelligence quotient (IQ), language skills, and social interaction. Teachers will be asked to complete a questionnaire describing the autistic child and his or her interaction with peers. The autistic children will complete a friendship survey, clinical global impressions scales, and a battery of neuropsychiatric tests. All assessments will be conducted at study start and again at study completion.", "condition": ["Autism", "Autistic Disorder"], "intervention_type": ["Behavioral", "Behavioral", "Behavioral", "Behavioral"], "intervention_name": ["Social skills training targeting children with autism", "Social skills training of peers without autism", "Combination treatment of social skills/education about autism", "Usual training"], "description": ["Sessions will focus on improving the social skills of autistic children.
