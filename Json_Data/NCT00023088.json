{"brief_title": "Screening Study for the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine", "brief_summary": "The primary function of the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine (RMD) is to diagnose and treat patients at the NIH who have problems in locomotion, activities of daily living, occupational roles, communication, swallowing, or problems with chronic pain. The major goal of this department s to help patients achieve maximal function so that they can resume their daily living activities as normal as possible. In order for the department to accomplish it's goal it requires the involvement of medical staff and the use of a variety of tests and instruments. Before a new test, evaluation technique, or piece of physical equipment can be considered for use in the treatment of patients it must be carefully studied. Researchers must make sure the test, technique, or instrument is safe, sensitive, accurate, specific, and reproducible. Therefore all of these tests, techniques, and instruments must first undergo a trial period. Normal volunteers and patients from the RMD and outside of the RMD may be selected to participate in the trial period. This study provides a framework for researchers in the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine (RMD) to develop new tests, techniques, technology, and equipment.", "detailed_description": "This protocol provides a framework for clinicians in the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine (RMD) to develop and pilot new tests, techniques, technology, or equipment to remain state-of-the-art.", "condition": "Healthy", "criteria": "- INCLUSION CRITERIA: In- and outpatients referred to the Rehabilitation Medicine Department.
