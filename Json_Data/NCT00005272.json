DESIGN NARRATIVE: The first study used HHANES I data and analysis of variance to determine the possible body composition differences between subgroups of gender and smoking categories. Caloric differences in dietary intake were analyzed in a second ANOVA design. The second study used data from HHANES I and NHANES II to evaluate the independent and additive or synergistic contribution of smoking rate and fasting glucose on body weight.", "condition": ["Cardiovascular Diseases", "Heart Diseases"], "criteria": "No eligibility criteria", "gender": "Male", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "100 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "mesh_term": ["Cardiovascular Diseases", "Heart Diseases"], "id": "NCT00005272"}
