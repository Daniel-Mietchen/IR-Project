{"brief_title": "A Phase I/II Safety and Immunogenicity Trial of UBI Microparticulate Monovalent (HIV-1 MN) Branched Peptide Vaccine in HIV-1 Seronegative Human Subjects", "brief_summary": "To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a combination of microparticulate monovalent HIV-1 MN synthetic branched peptide candidate vaccine for oral administration and monovalent HIV-1 MN synthetic branched peptide vaccine in alum for intramuscular administration in intermediate or higher risk HIV-negative volunteers.", "detailed_description": "Volunteers receive one of two schedules of vaccines or placebo administered at days 0, 28, and 168. Specifically, group 1 receives oral microparticulate monovalent vaccine over 3 consecutive days on days 0, 1, and 2, and 28, 29, and 30, with the intramuscular monovalent vaccine given on day 168. Group 2 receives the intramuscular vaccine first, on day 0, followed by the oral form given on days 28, 29, and 30 and 168, 169, and 170. Volunteers are followed for 1 year.", "condition": ["HIV Infections"], "intervention_type": ["Biological", "Biological"], "intervention_name": ["HIV-1 Peptide Vaccine, Microparticulate Monovalent", "rgp120/HIV-1MN Monovalent Octameric V3 Peptide Vaccine"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria Volunteers must have: - Normal history and physical exam. - HIV negativity. - CD4 count >= 400 cells/mm3. - Intermediate or high risk sexual behavior or a history of injection drug use within 12 months prior to study entry. - Normal urine dipstick with esterase and nitrite.
