{"brief_title": "Safety and Effectiveness of Zintevir (AR177) Given to HIV-Infected Patients", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to give zintevir (AR177) to asymptomatic (no symptoms) HIV-infected patients. Zintevir belongs to a new class of anti-HIV drugs, the integrase inhibitors. HIV uses the protein integrase to infect a cell. Integrase inhibitors block integrase and may stop replication of HIV.", "detailed_description": "Zintevir belongs to a new class of anti-HIV drugs, the integrase inhibitors. The HIV-1 virus uses the protein integrase to incorporate its genetic material into the infected host cell. Integrase inhibitors block integrase and may stop replication of the HIV-1 virus. In this open-label, Phase I/II study, 3 groups of HIV-positive patients (12 patients total) receive escalating doses of intravenous zintevir for 14 consecutive days.", "condition": ["HIV Infections"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Zintevir"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria You may be eligible for this study if you: - Are HIV-positive, but do not have any symptoms of HIV infection. - Have a CD4 count greater than 200 cells/mm3. - Have a viral load (level of HIV in the body) greater than 4,000 copies/ml. - Are at least 18 years old.
