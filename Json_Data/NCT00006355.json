{"brief_title": "Pyrazoloacridine Followed by Radiation Therapy in Treating Adults With Newly Diagnosed Supratentorial Glioblastoma Multiforme", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining chemotherapy and radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of pyrazoloacridine followed by radiation therapy in treating adults who have newly diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics of pyrazoloacridine in adults with newly diagnosed, supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme treated with pyrazoloacridine followed by radiotherapy. - Determine the response rate, duration of disease free survival, and survival of patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to type of anticonvulsant (hepatic metabolic enzyme inducers vs hepatic metabolic enzyme moderate inducers or noninducers). Patients receive pyrazoloacridine (PZA) IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for a maximum of 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Following completion of PZA treatment, patients undergo cranial irradiation 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Cohorts of 3 patients receive escalating doses of PZA until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. Additional patients receive PZA at the MTD. Patients are followed monthly for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 3 patients will be accrued for phase I and a total of 18-35 patients will be accrued for phase II of this study.", "condition": ["Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Procedure", "Radiation"], "intervention_name": ["pyrazoloacridine", "adjuvant therapy", "radiation therapy"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically proven, newly diagnosed, supratentorial, grade IV astrocytoma (glioblastoma multiforme) - Incompletely resected disease - Must have measurable and contrast enhancing tumor on the postoperative MRI/CT scan PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 18 and over Performance status: - Karnofsky 60-100% Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - Absolute neutrophil count at least 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 100,000/mm^3 Hepatic: - Bilirubin no greater than 1.5 mg/dL - Transaminases no greater than 4 times upper limit of normal Renal: - Creatinine no greater than 1.7 mg/dL Other: - No other serious concurrent infection or medical illness that would preclude study therapy - No other active malignancy within the past 5 years except curatively treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix or basal cell skin cancer - No psychosis requiring ongoing therapy with antipsychotic medication - Mini mental score at least 15 - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - No prior immunotherapy or biologic agents (including immunotoxins, immunoconjugates, antisense compounds, peptide receptor antagonists, interferons, interleukins, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, lymphokine activated killer cells, or gene therapy) for glioblastoma multiforme - No concurrent prophylactic growth factors (e.g., filgrastim [G-CSF] or sargramostim [GM-CSF]) Chemotherapy: - No prior chemotherapy for glioblastoma multiforme Endocrine therapy: - No prior hormonal therapy for glioblastoma multiforme - Prior glucocorticoids allowed - Concurrent corticosteroids allowed if on stable dose (no increase within the past 5 days) Radiotherapy: - No prior radiotherapy for glioblastoma multiforme Surgery: - See Disease Characteristics - Recovered from immediate postoperative period Other: - Greater than 10 days since prior anticonvulsants that induce hepatic metabolic enzymes (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone, or felbamate) - No other concurrent investigational agents", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "adult gliosarcoma", "mesh_term": ["Glioblastoma", "Nervous System Neoplasms", "Central Nervous System Neoplasms", "NSC 366140"], "id": "NCT00006355"}
