{"brief_title": "Tight Glycemic Control in Critical Care Patients", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of tight control of serum glucose levels with an intensive insulin treatment in patients hospitalized in an intensive care unit with medical and surgical patients.", "detailed_description": "Reduction of morbidity-mortality in critical care patients with tight glycemic control had been proven in surgical patients only. Study Hypothesis: In critical care patients, medical or surgical, a glucose serum level between 80 - 110 mg/dL means a lower mortality than patients with glucose levels of more than 110 mg/dL.", "condition": ["Critical Illness", "Hyperglycemia", "Insulin Resistance"], "intervention_type": ["Behavioral", "Behavioral"], "intervention_name": ["Tight control of blood glucose levels", "Conventional control of glucose levels"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - 15 years of age or older, - Probability of staying in critical care for more than 48 hours, - Agreement with the informed consent.
