{"brief_title": "Treatments for Depression: Drug Versus Psychotherapy", "brief_summary": "This 4-8 month study, with a 2-year follow up period, will compare sertraline (Zoloft\u00ae), venlafaxine (Effexor\u00ae), supportive-expressive psychotherapy, and placebo to determine which is more effective in treating major depression.", "detailed_description": "MDD is one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders. Different forms of psychotherapy for depression have been found effective. This study compares a form of dynamic psychotherapy called supportive-expressive psychotherapy to medication and to placebo. Participants are evaluated on 2 occasions, 1 week apart, before they are randomly assigned to receive either supportive-expressive psychotherapy, sertraline (Zoloft) (followed by venlafaxine [Effexor] if patients do not respond to sertraline), or placebo. The active phase of treatment lasts 4 months. The frequency of patients' visits depends on the assigned treatment. Patients who are randomized to receive medication or placebo are initially seen on a weekly basis, then less often, depending on the rate of symptomatic improvement. Patients who are randomized to psychotherapy are seen twice a week for the first 4 weeks, then once a week for the remaining 12 weeks. Outcome is monitored at week 2,4,6,7,8, 12, 15 and 16. At the end of the first 16 weeks of treatment, patients are thoroughly evaluated. Those who have responded to treatment are assigned to a continuation phase and are seen once a month for another 16 weeks. At the end of the 16-week continuation phase, patients are again evaluated and all treatments are stopped. Follow-up continues every 3 months for up to 2 years to ensure that the patients' depression remains under control.", "condition": ["Depression"], "intervention_type": ["Behavioral", "Drug", "Drug", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Supportive Expressive Therapy", "Sertraline", "Pill Placebo", "Venlafaxine"], "description": ["The aim of supportive-expressive psychotherapy is to help patients understand the causes of relationship conflicts in the context of a supportive relationship.", "Participants will receive sertraline.", "Participants will receive a pill placebo.", "Participants will receive venlafaxine."], "arm_group_label": ["3 Supportive-expressive psychotherapy", "1 Sertraline", "4 Placebo", "2 Venlafaxine"], "other_name": ["Zoloft", "Effexor"], "criteria": "Inclusion criteria: - Major Depressive Disorder diagnosis Exclusion criteria: - Psychotic or bipolar disorder diagnosis - Substance dependence in the last 6 months", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "70 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "Major Depressive Disorder", "mesh_term": ["Depression", "Depressive Disorder", "Venlafaxine Hydrochloride", "Sertraline", "Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors"], "id": "NCT00043550"}
