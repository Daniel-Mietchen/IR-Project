{"brief_title": "Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Melanoma That Cannot Be Removed By Surgery", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well vaccine therapy works in treating patients with stage III or stage IV melanoma that cannot be removed by surgery.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the antitumor immune response in patients with unresectable stage III or IV melanoma treated with vaccine comprising multiple synthetic melanoma peptides, sargramostim (GM-CSF), and Montanide ISA-51. OUTLINE: Patients receive vaccine comprising multiple synthetic melanoma peptides, sargramostim (GM-CSF), and Montanide ISA-51 on days 1, 8, 15, 29, 36, and 43. Patients undergo removal of the lymph node draining the vaccination site on day 22 to assess immune response. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 29 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": "Melanoma (Skin)", "intervention_type": "Biological", "intervention_name": "sargramostim", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Diagnosis of melanoma - Unresectable stage III or IV disease - Mucosal or ocular disease allowed - Positive HLA-A1, -A2, or -A3 expression PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - 12 and over Performance status - ECOG 0-1 Life expectancy - Not specified Hematopoietic - Absolute neutrophil count > 1,000/mm^3 - Platelet count > 100,000/mm^3 - Hemoglobin > 9 g/dL Hepatic - Liver function tests \u2264 2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) Renal - Creatinine \u2264 1.5 times ULN Cardiovascular - No New York Heart Association class III or IV heart disease Other - Weight \u2265 100 pounds - Not pregnant or nursing - No other malignancy within the past 5 years except squamous cell or basal cell skin cancer without known metastasis, carcinoma in situ of the breast, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - No prior vaccination with any of the peptides used in this protocol - More than 1 year since prior melanoma vaccine therapy - More than 4 weeks since prior immunotherapy - More than 4 weeks since prior growth factors - More than 4 weeks since prior allergy shots Chemotherapy - More than 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy Endocrine therapy - More than 4 weeks since prior steroid therapy Radiotherapy - More than 4 weeks since prior radiotherapy Surgery - Prior tumor resection allowed", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "12 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00089206.xml"}
