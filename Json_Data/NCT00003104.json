{"brief_title": "Computer Planned Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Computer systems that allow doctors to create a 3-dimensional picture of the tumor in order to plan treatment may result in more effective radiation therapy. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well radiation therapy that has been planned with a computer works in treating patients with prostate cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Establish the efficacy of high-dose three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy in patients with intermediate prognostic risk adenocarcinoma of the prostate. - Determine the PSA relapse-free survival rate of this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients receive high-dose three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy 4-5 days per week for at least 9 weeks. Patients are evaluated at least weekly during radiotherapy and at 2 and 4 months after treatment completion. Thereafter, patients are followed every 6 months for a total of 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Prostate Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Radiation"], "intervention_name": ["radiation therapy"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically proven intermediate prognostic risk (T1-T2) adenocarcinoma of the prostate - Previously untreated (except for hormonal therapy) - PSA levels greater than 10 ng/mL and Gleason scores no greater than 6 OR - PSA levels no greater than 10 ng/mL and Gleason scores at least 7 - Patients requiring volume reduction of prostate prior to radiotherapy continue to be treated at least 3 months on neoadjuvant hormonal therapy prior to radiation - No evidence of distant metastases - No regional lymph node involvement PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - Not specified Performance status: - Not specified Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - Not specified Hepatic: - Not specified Renal: - Not specified Other: - No major medical illness - No psychosis - No metallic pelvic prosthesis PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - Not specified Chemotherapy: - No prior chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: - See Disease Characteristics - Prior neoadjuvant antiandrogen therapy allowed Radiotherapy: - No prior radiotherapy - No prior pelvic irradiation Surgery: - No prior radical surgery for carcinoma of the prostate", "gender": "Male", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "stage IIA prostate cancer", "mesh_term": ["Prostatic Neoplasms"], "id": "NCT00003104"}
