{"brief_title": "A Phase III Study of BMS-188667 in Subjects With Active Rheumatoid Arthritis", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this clinical research study is to learn if abatacept is safe when co-administered with other approved rheumatoid arthritis medications.", "detailed_description": "This was a multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 2-arm, parallel-dosing designed study. The treatment period was 12 months. Eligible participants were randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups: abatacept fixed dose approximating 10 mg/kg (based on participant's body weight; 500 mg for participants weighing < 60kg; 750 mg for participants weighing 60 to 100 kg; and 1 gram for participants weighing > 100 kg, monthly) or placebo intravenous (IV) infusion. All participants continued their background therapy(ies) for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (non-biologic or biologic disease-modifying drugs [DMARDs], or combination) throughout the double-blind treatment period. Double-blind study medication (abatacept or placebo) was administered on Days 1, 15, 29, and every 28 days thereafter, for a total of 14 doses. All participants who completed the 12-month double-blind study period (Day 1 through Day 365), were eligible to continue into the open-label period. All eligible participants (active or placebo) were re-allocated to receive abatacept at a weight-tiered dose that approximated 10 mg/kg, based on their Day 365 body weight. Participants continued to receive infusions every 28 days.", "condition": "Rheumatoid Arthritis", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Open-label Abatacept", "description": "Concentrate and diluted in a solution, IV, 500 mg (body weight < 60 Kg); 750 mg (body weight 60-100 Kg); 1000 mg (body weight > 100 Kg), Once daily, Every 28 days.", "arm_group_label": "Open-label Abatacept", "other_name": "BMS-188667", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Meet criteria of American Rheumatism Association for the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and the American College of Rheumatology functional classes I, II III or IV - Participants must be taking 1 or more DMARDs and/or biologic approved for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for at least 3 months and be on a stable dose for 28 days prior to Day 1.
