{"brief_title": "The PRECISE Trial: Study of IL13-PE38QQR Compared to GLIADEL Wafer in Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme", "brief_summary": "The purpose of the PRECISE trial is to determine whether overall survival duration, safety, and quality of life are improved for patients treated with IL13-PE38QQR compared to patients treated with GLIADEL\u00ae Wafer following surgical tumor removal in the treatment of first recurrence of glioblastoma multiforme.", "detailed_description": "PRECISE is a Phase III clinical trial of experimental drug IL13-PE38QQR (Study Drug). IL13-PE38QQR is a tumor-targeting agent administered by a continuous infusion directly into the brain around the cavity where the tumor has been removed. Through previous research, this Study Drug has shown potential to control some of the recurrent malignant gliomas, such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), anaplastic astrocytoma, and malignant mixed oligoastrocytoma. The Study Drug is made by combining a human protein (IL13) with a portion of a bacterial toxin protein, Pseudomonas Exotoxin (PE). The IL13 portion binds to receptors on the tumor like a \"key to a lock,\" allowing the PE portion to enter and kill those cells. Since tumor cells preferentially bind the drug, normal (healthy) brain cells are much less likely to be damaged by the drug. The Study Drug is delivered through tubing or catheters placed directly into the area surrounding the resection cavity. These catheters will be surgically placed from 2-7 days after the tumor has been removed. A pump is then used to slowly push the drug solution through the catheters using convection-enhanced delivery (CED) over a period of 4 days. The GLIADEL\u00ae Wafer is an anti-cancer drug that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and sold for the treatment of recurrent or newly diagnosed GBM. Patients receiving GLIADEL\u00ae will have wafers placed at the time of surgery to remove tumor. Eligible patients enrolled in the PRECISE trial will be randomly assigned to receive either IL13-PE38QQR or GLIADEL\u00ae Wafer. Patients will have a 2 out of 3 chance to receive IL13-PE38QQR and 1 out of 3 chance to receive GLIADEL\u00ae Wafer.", "condition": "Glioblastoma Multiforme", "intervention_type": "Procedure", "intervention_name": "surgery and wafer placement (1 procedure)", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Patients must be \u2265 18 years old. - Patients must have clinical and/or radiographic evidence of FIRST recurrence or progression of supratentorial GBM afer a previous resection or biopsy and external beam radiation therapy. - Patients must have histopathologic documentation of GBM at initial diagnosis. - Patients must have had previous cytoreductive surgery or biopsy for GBM. - Patients must have received external beam radiotherapy with \u2265 45 Gy tumor dose, completed \u2265 4 weeks prior to study entry. - Gross total resection (i.e., \u2265 95% resection of the solid, contrast-enhancing tumor component) must be planned. - Tumor must have a solid contrast-enhancing component \u2265 1.0 cm in diameter.
