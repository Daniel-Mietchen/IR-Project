{"brief_title": "Docetaxel, Radiation Therapy, and Hormone Therapy in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer", "brief_summary": "This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of docetaxel when given with radiation therapy and hormone therapy in patients with locally advanced prostate cancer.", "detailed_description": "Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Docetaxel may also make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Drugs, such as leuprolide, goserelin, or bicalutamide, may stop the adrenal glands from making androgens. Giving chemotherapy with radiation therapy and hormone therapy may kill more tumor cells.", "condition": "Prostate Cancer", "intervention_type": "Radiation", "intervention_name": "radiotherapy", "description": "External beam photon radiotherapy utilizing 3-D-conformal or intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) shall be used to deliver 77.4 4 Gy in 43 fractions of 1.8 Gy fractions.", "arm_group_label": "Experimental Arm", "other_name": "Lupron", "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: 1.
