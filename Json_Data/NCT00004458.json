{"brief_title": "Longitudinal and Biological Study of Childhood Disintegrative Disorder", "brief_summary": "OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the developmental course (language acquisition, diagnostic stability, predictors of outcome, and restricted interests and behaviors) of childhood disintegrative disorder versus autism and non-autistic developmental delays. II. Collect data on molecular genetics of proband and family members.", "detailed_description": "PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients are evaluated with the following questionnaires at ages 2-3 years and again at ages 5-9: The Autism Diagnostic Interview (ADI); The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS); Assessment of cognitive functioning; Expressive and receptive language; Adaptive functioning; Measures of burden and functional assessment; The Aberrant Behavior Checklist; The Connors Rating Scale - Parent and Teacher version; and Autism Behavior Checklist An MRI and EEG are performed, and blood samples are collected from patients and family members for molecular genetic studies.", "condition": "Autism", "criteria": "- Psychologically diagnosed (DSM-IV) as Childhood Disintegrative Disorder - No known genetic or medical syndrome (Down syndrome or cerebral palsy) - Must speak English", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "2 Years", "maximum_age": "9 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00004458.xml"}
