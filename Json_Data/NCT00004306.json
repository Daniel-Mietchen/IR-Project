{"brief_title": "Clinical and Molecular Correlations in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 10 (SCA10)", "brief_summary": "OBJECTIVES: I. Clinically evaluate members from families with a dominantly inherited ataxia and collect blood, skin and muscle samples for detailed molecular studies. II. Perform detailed clinical evaluations on patients with recessively inherited ataxias.", "detailed_description": "PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Participants undergo a comprehensive clinical and molecular evaluation. Studies include: neurologic evaluation, including magnetic resonance imaging and nerve conduction studies; ophthalmologic exam; audiologic exam, including auditory brain stem evoked response; DNA extraction from blood, skin and muscle; genotype phenotype correlation. A neuropathologic evaluation is conducted postmortem, when possible.", "condition": "Hereditary Ataxia", "study_pop": "\n      ", "sampling_method": "Non-Probability Sample", "criteria": "Inclusion criteria: Subjects who have the diagnosis of SCA10 and their immediate relatives.
