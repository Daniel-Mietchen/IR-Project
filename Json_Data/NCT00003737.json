{"brief_title": "Rebeccamycin Analog in Treating Children With Relapsed or Refractory Neuroblastoma", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of rebeccamycin analog in treating children who have relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate to rebeccamycin analogue in children with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma. - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. - Identify and establish in vitro biologic correlates of clinical responses and toxicity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive rebeccamycin analogue IV over 1 hour once on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue up to 30 patients within 1.5 years.", "condition": "Neuroblastoma", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "becatecarin", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically proven relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma - Measurable disease PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - Children Performance status: - ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy: - At least 2 months Hematopoietic: - Not specified Hepatic: - Bilirubin less than 1.5 mg/dL - SGOT and SGPT less than 2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) - Adequate liver function unless due to disease Renal: - Creatinine no greater than 1.5 times ULN OR - Creatinine clearance at least 60 mL/min - Adequate renal function unless due to disease Other: - No other serious concurrent illness - No active uncontrolled infection - Not pregnant - Fertile patients must use effective contraception PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - Recovered from prior immunotherapy - Prior autologous bone marrow transplantation allowed - No concurrent immunotherapy Chemotherapy: - At least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy and recovered - No other concurrent systemic chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: - Not specified Radiotherapy: - Recovered from prior radiotherapy Surgery: - Not specified", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "18 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00003737.xml"}
