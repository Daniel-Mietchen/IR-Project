{"brief_title": "Pilot Study of Budesonide for Patients With Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis", "brief_summary": "OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the safety and effectiveness of budesonide in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis or primary biliary cirrhosis experiencing a suboptimal response to ursodeoxycholic acid. II. Estimate the efficacy of this therapy in these patient groups as a means of evaluating the feasibility of a long-term randomized trial.", "detailed_description": "PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients receive budesonide by mouth 3 times daily for a minimum of 6 months. If liver biochemistries become normal, dosage is reduced to once daily.
