{"brief_title": "Silymarin (Milk Thistle Extract) in Treating Patients With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Who Are Receiving Chemotherapy", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Silymarin (milk thistle extract) is an herb that may be effective in treating liver disorders caused by cancer therapy. PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of silymarin in treating patients who have acute lymphoblastic leukemia with chemotherapy-related side effects to the liver.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the effect of silymarin, in terms of liver function tests, in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia receiving hepatotoxic chemotherapy. - Determine the effect of this drug on free and conjugated serum silibinin values in these patients. - Determine the serum antioxidant capacity by Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the oxidative damage, as determined by 8-oxodeoxyguanosine adducts, in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive oral silymarin daily for 28 days. - Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo as in arm I. Patients are followed at day 56. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients (25 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Drug/Agent Toxicity by Tissue/Organ", "Leukemia"], "intervention_type": ["Dietary Supplement"], "intervention_name": ["silymarin"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) - Currently receiving maintenance or continuation phase chemotherapy for ALL - Regimen comprising intrathecal and oral methotrexate; vincristine IV; oral prednisone or dexamethasone; and oral mercaptopurine - Elevated liver function tests, evidenced by 1 of the following criteria: - Bilirubin greater than 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) - AST greater than 2.5 times ULN - ALT greater than 2.5 times ULN PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - 2 to 21 Performance status - Not specified Life expectancy - Not specified Hematopoietic - Not specified Hepatic - See Disease Characteristics Renal - Not specified PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - Not specified Chemotherapy - See Disease Characteristics Endocrine therapy - See Disease Characteristics Radiotherapy - Not specified Surgery - Not specified", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "2 Years", "maximum_age": "21 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia", "mesh_term": ["Leukemia", "Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma", "Leukemia, Lymphoid", "Silymarin"], "id": "NCT00055718"}
