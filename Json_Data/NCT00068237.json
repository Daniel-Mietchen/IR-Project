{"brief_title": "Salivary Gland Surgery Before Radiation Therapy in Preventing Radiation-Caused Xerostomia in Patients With Head and Neck Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Moving a salivary gland out of the area that will undergo radiation therapy may protect the gland from side effects of radiation therapy and may prevent xerostomia (dry mouth). PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of salivary gland surgery in preventing xerostomia in patients who are undergoing radiation therapy for head and neck cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the reproducibility of the surgical technique of submandibular salivary gland transfer in patients with head and neck cancer. - Determine the rate and severity of radiation-induced xerostomia after this surgery in these patients. - Determine the pattern of recurrence, disease-free survival, and overall survival of patients treated with this surgery followed by radiotherapy. - Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients undergo surgical transfer of the submandibular salivary gland to the submental space. Within 4-6 weeks after surgery, patients undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week for 5 \u00bd to 7 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Salivary scans are performed before surgery, at 2-3 weeks after surgery, and then at 6 months from the start of radiotherapy. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months from the start of radiotherapy. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years and then annually. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 11-48 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.6 years.", "condition": "Xerostomia", "intervention_type": "Radiation", "intervention_name": "Post-operative radiation therapy", "arm_group_label": "Surgery and salivary gland transfer and radiation", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - One of the following diagnoses: - Histologically confirmed, previously untreated squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx - Head and neck cancer of unknown primary with unilateral metastases to the neck nodes - No N3 disease - No carcinoma of the oral cavity or nasopharynx - No bilateral neck node involvement - No suspicious neck node on the contralateral neck or the side chosen for salivary gland transfer by CT scan or MRI - No pre-epiglottic space involvement - No involvement of level 1 nodes on either side of the neck - No salivary gland malignancy - No recurrent disease PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - At least 18 years old Performance status - Zubrod 0-1 Life expectancy - Not specified Hematopoietic - Hemoglobin at least 10 g/dL Hepatic - Not specified Renal - Not specified Other - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception - No salivary gland disease (e.g., Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome) - No other malignancy within the past 3 years except basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - Not specified Chemotherapy - More than 3 years since prior chemotherapy - No prior or concurrent neoadjuvant chemotherapy - Concurrent adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (in addition to study radiotherapy) allowed Endocrine therapy - Not specified Radiotherapy - See Chemotherapy - No prior radiotherapy to the head and neck - No concurrent intensity-modulated radiotherapy Surgery - Not specified Other - No concurrent cholinergic drugs - No concurrent anti-cholinergic drugs - No concurrent tricyclic drugs - No concurrent prophylactic amifostine or pilocarpine during and for at least 3 months after completion of study radiotherapy", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00068237.xml"}
