{"brief_title": "PEG-Interferon Alfa-2b, Sargramostim, and Thalidomide in Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: PEG-interferon alfa-2b may interfere with the growth of tumor cells. Colony-stimulating factors such as sargramostim may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood. Thalidomide may stop the growth of cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor. Combining PEG-interferon alfa-2b with sargramostim and thalidomide may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving PEG-interferon alfa-2b together with sargramostim and thalidomide works in treating patients with metastatic kidney cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the response to PEG-interferon alfa-2b, sargramostim (GM-CSF), and thalidomide in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Secondary - Determine duration of response in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the tolerance to and toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the median and progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: Patients receive PEG-interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously (SC) on days 1 and 8, sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC on days 1-10, and oral thalidomide once daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": "Kidney Cancer", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "thalidomide", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed renal cell carcinoma - Metastatic disease - Measurable disease - Unidimensionally measurable lesion \u2265 20 mm by conventional techniques OR \u2265 10 mm by spiral CT scan or MRI - Histologic confirmation required if measurable disease is confined to a solitary lesion - The following are not considered measurable disease: - Bone disease only - Pleural or peritoneal metastases - CNS lesions - Irradiated lesions unless disease progression was documented after prior radiotherapy PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - 18 and over Performance status - ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy - Not specified Hematopoietic - Granulocyte count \u2265 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count \u2265 100,000/mm^3 Hepatic - Bilirubin \u2264 1.5 mg/dL - No decompensated liver disease Renal - Creatinine \u2264 2.0 mg/dL Immunologic - No known or suspected hypersensitivity to interferon alfa or to any excipient or vehicle included in the formulation or delivery system - No history of autoimmune disease - No autoimmune hepatitis - No immunosuppressed transplantation recipients Other - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use 2 effective methods of contraception 4 weeks before, during, and for 4 weeks after study participation - No pre-existing thyroid abnormalities for which thyroid function cannot be maintained in the normal range - No severe psychiatric condition or disorder, including suicidal ideation or attempt - No other active malignancy except nonmelanoma skin cancer PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - No prior immunotherapy Chemotherapy - Not specified Endocrine therapy - Not specified Radiotherapy - See Disease Characteristics - More than 4 weeks since prior radiotherapy Surgery - Not specified", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00090870.xml"}
