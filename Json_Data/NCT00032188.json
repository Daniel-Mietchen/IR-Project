{"brief_title": "Interleukin-2 and Bryostatin 1 in Treating Patients With Advanced Kidney Cancer", "brief_summary": "Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining bryostatin 1 with interleukin-2 may cause a stronger immune response and kill more tumor cells. Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining interleukin-2 and bryostatin 1 in treating patients who have advanced kidney cancer", "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective response rate in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma treated with interleukin-2 (IL-2) and bryostatin 1. II. Compare the toxicity of 3 different doses of bryostatin 1 given in combination with a fixed dose of IL-2 in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of three dose levels of bryostatin 1. ARM I: Patients receive interleukin-2 (IL-2) subcutaneously on days 1-4, 8-11, and 15-18. For the second and subsequent courses of IL-2, patients also receive lowest dose bryostatin 1 IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for at least 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: Patients receive IL-2 as in arm I and middle dose bryostatin 1 IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for at least 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM III: Patients receive IL-2 as in arm I and highest dose bryostatin 1 IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for at least 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or responding disease may receive 3 additional courses of therapy. An additional cohort of patients receives treatment as above at a higher dose to evaluate toxicity. Patients are followed for 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-65 patients (8-16 per bryostatin 1 dose level) will be accrued for this study within 14-27 months.", "condition": ["Recurrent Renal Cell Cancer", "Stage III Renal Cell Cancer", "Stage IV Renal Cell Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Biological", "Drug", "Other"], "intervention_name": ["aldesleukin", "bryostatin 1", "laboratory biomarker analysis"], "description": ["Given subcutaneously", "Given IV", "Correlative studies"], "arm_group_label": ["Arm I (aldesleukin and lowest dose bryostatin 1)", "Arm II (aldesleukin and middle dose bryostatin 1)", "Arm III (aldesleukin and highest dose bryostatin 1)", "Arm I (aldesleukin and lowest dose bryostatin 1)", "Arm II (aldesleukin and middle dose bryostatin 1)", "Arm III (aldesleukin and highest dose bryostatin 1)", "Arm I (aldesleukin and lowest dose bryostatin 1)", "Arm II (aldesleukin and middle dose bryostatin 1)", "Arm III (aldesleukin and highest dose bryostatin 1)"], "other_name": ["IL-2", "Proleukin", "recombinant human interleukin-2", "recombinant interleukin-2", "B705008K112", "BRYO", "Bryostatin"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Histologically or cytologically confirmed renal cell carcinoma - Recurrent or refractory advanced disease - Newly diagnosed disease with no appropriate standard therapy available - Measurable disease - No active CNS metastases - Single prior CNS metastasis allowed if all of the following are true: - Previously resected and irradiated - No evidence of progressive CNS disease for at least 8 weeks after completion of therapy - No requirement for steroids or anti-seizure medications - Performance status - ECOG 0-2 - More than 3 months - WBC at least 3,000/mm^3 - Absolute neutrophil count at least 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 100,000/mm^3 - Bilirubin no greater than 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) - AST/ALT no greater than 2.5 times ULN - Creatinine no greater than 2.0 mg/dL - No symptomatic congestive heart failure - No unstable angina pectoris - No cardiac arrhythmia - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective barrier contraception during and for at least 2 weeks after study for female patients and for 3 months after study for male patients - No concurrent uncontrolled illness - No ongoing or active infection - No psychiatric illness or social situation that would preclude study entry - No prior interleukin-2 - See Disease Characteristics - See Disease Characteristics - Prior radiotherapy to less than 50% of bone marrow allowed - At least 4 weeks since prior radiotherapy - See Disease Characteristics - No other concurrent investigational agents - No concurrent combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-positive patients", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "mesh_term": ["Carcinoma, Renal Cell", "Aldesleukin", "Bryostatin 1", "Interleukin-2"], "id": "NCT00032188"}
