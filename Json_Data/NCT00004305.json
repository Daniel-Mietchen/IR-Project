{"brief_title": "Study of Genetic Anomalies of Complement Related Proteins in Patients With IgA Glomerulonephritis", "brief_summary": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether allelic differences associated with the fourth component of complement, type-1 complement receptor expressed on erythrocytes, and Fc receptor FcgRIII contribute to the pathogenesis of IgA glomerulonephritis (IgA-N). II. Compare genetic anomalies of these key components in immune complex processing and clearance between juvenile vs adult onset IgA-N vs normal controls.", "detailed_description": "PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Participants undergo qualitative genetic analysis of complement-related proteins. Studies include: genomic re-arrangement of 4-gene unit, C4 DNA sequence and RNA expression, type-1 complement receptor DNA sequence, Fc-gamma receptor IIIA isoform analysis, classical and alternative complement activation pathway assays, plasma C4 and C4d protein levels, and immunoglobulin patterns in glomerular deposits.", "condition": ["IGA Glomerulonephritis"], "criteria": "- IgA glomerulonephritis", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "renal and genitourinary disorders", "mesh_term": ["Glomerulonephritis", "Glomerulonephritis, IGA"], "id": "NCT00004305"}
