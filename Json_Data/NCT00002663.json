These are: 1. Patients developing or at risk for EBV lymphomas or lymphoproliferative disorders following an allogeneic marrow transplant. 2. Patients developing or at risk for EBV lymphomas or lymphoproliferative disorders following an allogeneic organ transplant. 3. Patients with AIDS developing EBV lymphomas or lymphoproliferative diseases as a consequence of the profound acquired immunodeficiency induced by HIV. 4. Patients who develop EBV lymphomas or lymphoproliferative diseases as a consequence of profound immunodeficiencies associated with a congenital immune deficit or acquired as a sequela of anti-neoplastic or immunosuppressive therapy. 5. Patients who develop other EBV-associated malignancies without pre-existing immune deficiency, including: EBV+ Hodgkin's and Non- Hodgkin's disease, EBV+ nasopharyngeal carcinoma, EBV+ hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, or EBV+ leiomyosarcoma. Exclusion Criteria: The following patients will be excluded from this study: - Moribund patients who, by virtue of heart, kidney, liver, lung, or neurologic dysfunction not related to lymphoma, are unlikely to survive the 6-8 weeks required for in vitro generation and expansion of the EBV-specific T cells to be used for therapy and the subsequent 3 weeks required to achieve an initial assessment of the effects of infusions of EBV-specific T cells. - Pregnancy does not constitute a contraindication to infusions of EBV-specific T cells.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "unspecified childhood solid tumor, protocol specific", "mesh_term": ["Lymphoma", "Neoplasms", "Viremia", "Lymphoproliferative Disorders"], "id": "NCT00002663"}
