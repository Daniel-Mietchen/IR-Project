Patients will be randomized (like tossing a coin) to 1 of 2 groups: Group 1: Patients will go on a specific diet and will be taught new behavior skills. Group 2: Patients will be taught ways to take care of themselves and will be given general nutrition information. Patients also will be grouped based on the cause of their diarrhea (food absorption problems or anti-HIV medication side effects). Patients will make a note of when they have bowel movements and will write down all food and drugs they take for the entire study. They will be interviewed at entry and at Weeks 1, 2, 3, 8, 16, and 24. Patients will be paid for participating in this study.", "condition": ["Diarrhea", "HIV Infections"], "intervention_type": ["Behavioral"], "intervention_name": ["Dietary intervention"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Have HIV infection or AIDS. - Have diarrhea an average of 3 times a day for at least 3 weeks. - Have a negative stool test.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "HIV Seropositivity", "mesh_term": ["HIV Infections", "Diarrhea"], "id": "NCT00017810"}
