{"brief_title": "Pharmacokinetic Study of Palifermin in Subjects Receiving Radiation Therapy and Chemotherapy Followed by Blood Stem Cell Support", "brief_summary": "Open label palifermin will be administered to subjects who are at a risk of developing mucositis after radiotherapy and chemotherapy followed by blood stem cell support. The amount of palifermin in the blood following administration will be evaluated. The safety of palifermin administration and its effect on reducing mucositis will also be evaluated.", "detailed_description": "Mucositis is a common side effect to chemotherapy and radiotherapy involving the formation of erythema and ulcerative lesions in the mouth. Mucositis can be serious, resulting in pain requiring interventions such as analgesic medications and the use of parenteral feedings. Currently, no standard therapy is available to prevent or treat mucositis.", "condition": ["Leukemia", "Lymphoma", "Myeloma"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Radiation", "Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Palifermin 6 x 60 \u03bcg/kg/day", "Palifermin 2 x 180 \u03bcg/kg/day", "radiotherapy", "Chemotherapy"], "arm_group_label": ["Palifermin 6 x 60 \u03bcg/kg/day", "Palifermin 2 x 180 \u03bcg/kg/day", "Palifermin 6 x 60 \u03bcg/kg/day", "Palifermin 2 x 180 \u03bcg/kg/day", "Palifermin 6 x 60 \u03bcg/kg/day", "Palifermin 2 x 180 \u03bcg/kg/day"], "criteria": "- Patients diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, Hodgkin's Disease, Leukemia and Myeloma. - Eligible for treatment with radiation therapy and chemotherapy followed by blood stem cell support.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "76 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "radiation therapy", "id": "NCT00070616"}
