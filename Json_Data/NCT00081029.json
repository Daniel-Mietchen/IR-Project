{"brief_title": "Parotid-Sparing Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy Compared With Conventional Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Oropharyngeal or Hypopharyngeal Cancer Who Are at High Risk of Radiation-Induced Xerostomia", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy delivers thin beams of radiation of different strengths directly to the tumor from many angles. This type of radiation therapy may reduce damage to the parotid (salivary) glands, prevent xerostomia (dry mouth), and improve quality of life. It is not yet known whether intensity-modulated radiation therapy is more effective than conventional radiation therapy in preventing xerostomia and improving quality of life in patients who have throat cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying intensity-modulated radiation therapy to see how well it works compared to conventional radiation therapy in treating patients with oropharyngeal or hypopharyngeal cancer who are at risk of developing xerostomia caused by radiation therapy.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare the proportion of patients with oropharyngeal or hypopharyngeal cancer with xerostomia of \u2265 grade 2 at one year after treatment with parotid-sparing intensity-modulated radiotherapy vs conventional radiotherapy. Secondary - Compare the degree of xerostomia by quantitative measurements of stimulated and unstimulated salivary flow in patients treated with these regimens. - Compare quality of life in patients treated with these regimens. - Compare local and regional tumor control, time to tumor progression, and overall survival of patients treated with these regimens. - Compare acute and late side effects of these regimens in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to participating center and site of disease (oropharynx vs hypopharynx). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients undergo parotid-sparing intensity-modulated radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 6 weeks. - Arm II: Patients undergo conventional radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 6 weeks. Salivary flow measurements are performed at baseline, at week 4 during radiotherapy, and then at 2 weeks and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after the completion of radiotherapy. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at 2 weeks, and then at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after the completion of radiotherapy. Patients are followed monthly for 1 year, every 2 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 3 years.
