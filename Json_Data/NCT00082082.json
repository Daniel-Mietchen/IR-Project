{"brief_title": "A Trial of Thymalfasin in Adult Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma", "brief_summary": "The objective of this Phase II trial is to compare the efficacy and safety of 6 months of treatment with thymalfasin plus trans arterial chemoembolization (TACE) with TACE alone in adult patients with non-surgical hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).", "condition": ["Carcinoma, Hepatocellular"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Procedure"], "intervention_name": ["Thymalfasin (thymosin alpha-1)", "Trans arterial chemoembolization (TACE)"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Signed written informed consent. - Diagnosis of HCC by: 1. Presence of HCC on biopsy (core biopsy), or, if biopsy is strongly contra-indicated due to safety or patient-related concerns, then the diagnosis of HCC can be determined by: 2. A new hepatic defect on imaging with an AFP > 1000 ng/ml, or 3. A new hepatic defect on ultrasound or CT with an AFP < 1000 ng/ml when one of the following is present: 1. At least two additional imaging techniques show signs characteristic of HCC, or 2. The new hepatic defect has doubled in diameter over time, or 3. The AFP has progressively risen to > 200 ng/ml and triples the mean baseline. - HCC must be unresectable and non-transplantable. - Hematocrit > 30%, platelet count >= 50,000 per microliter, WBC > 2.0 x 109/L, and polymorphonuclear white cell count >= 1.0 x 109/L. - Adequate renal function as demonstrated by serum creatinine level < 1.5 mg/dl. - If the patient is a woman, she is using a definitive method of birth control in consultation with her physician, or is surgically sterile or post-menopausal. Exclusion Criteria: - Concomitant chronic use of any drug known to be hepatotoxic, or of any immunosuppressive drug (Use of oral contraceptives will not exclude an otherwise eligible patient). - Presence of main portal vein thrombosis or hepatic artery malformation. - HCC amenable to treatment by surgical resection or hepatic transplantation. - HIV infection diagnosed by HIV seropositivity and confirmed by Western blot. - Concomitant or prior history of malignancy other than HCC within the last 10 years, except for curatively treated skin cancer or surgically cured in situ carcinoma of the cervix. - Active infectious process that is not of a self-limiting nature. TB and AIDS are examples of infectious processes that are not of a self-limiting nature. - Pregnancy as documented by a urine pregnancy test. Women with reproductive potential must agree to practice an adequate method of birth control for the duration of the study. - Alcohol or intravenous drug abuse within the previous 1 year. - Previous treatment with thymalfasin. - Patients with known hypersensitivity to iodine. - Simultaneous participation in another investigational drug study, or participation in any clinical trial involving investigational drugs within 30 days of study entry.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "mesh_term": ["Carcinoma", "Carcinoma, Hepatocellular", "Thymalfasin"], "id": "NCT00082082"}
