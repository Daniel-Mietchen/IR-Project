It is important, therefore, to find effective alternative therapies to treat these symptoms. Patients are randomly assigned to receive 12 sessions (1 session/week for 12 weeks) of either PST or BST. Following treatment, patients are followed for 6 months to determine functional and clinical outcomes. Depression scales, disability scales, and scales that measure problem solving skills are used to assess patients.", "condition": ["Depression", "Cognition Disorders"], "intervention_type": ["Behavioral", "Behavioral"], "intervention_name": ["Problem Solving Therapy", "Brief Supportive Therapy"], "description": ["A 12 week cognitive behavioral intervention for depression that teaches patients a structured approach to solving social problems.", "A 12 week intervention for depression that focuses on supporting patients attempts to cope with depression."], "arm_group_label": ["1 Problem Solving Therapy", "2 Brief Supportive Therapy"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: - Nonpsychotic, unipolar major depression - Cognitive impairment - English speaking Exclusion Criteria: - High suicide risk - Dementia - Acute or severe medical illness - Current psychotherapy", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "60 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "Geriatrics", "mesh_term": ["Depression", "Depressive Disorder", "Cognition Disorders"], "id": "NCT00052091"}
