To compare the effectiveness of two different amphotericin B doses in the treatment of biopsy-proven Candida esophagitis. To determine if low-dose amphotericin B is less toxic than standard dose therapy during a limited treatment period. To evaluate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of the two different dosing regimens.", "condition": ["Candidiasis, Esophageal", "HIV Infections"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["Amphotericin B"], "criteria": "Exclusion Criteria Co-existing Condition: Patients with histological or clinical (skin rash, cotton wool exudates, Candida endophthalmitis, etc.) evidence of disseminated candidiasis are excluded.
