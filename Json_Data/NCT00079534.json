{"brief_title": "Distant Healing for HIV/AIDS", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to determine whether individuals praying at a distance (also known as \"Distant Healing\") can positively affect the health of people with HIV/AIDS.", "detailed_description": "Significant numbers of people with HIV/AIDS seek spiritual or \u201cpsychic\" treatment. Distant healing could potentially be of benefit to large numbers of HIV/AIDS patients, as it is widely available and requires no travel or other activity on the part of the patient. However, the treatment can be costly and has not yet been proven effective in a controlled clinical trial. This study will evaluate the efficacy of distant healing in patients with HIV/AIDS. Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to either the distant healing group or a control group. All participants will have hour-long study visits at entry and Months 6 and 12. At study visits, participants will complete a demographic questionnaire, self-report health and symptom inventory, quality of life assessment, and profile of mood states. Blood will be drawn at each study visit.", "condition": "AIDS", "intervention_type": "Behavioral", "intervention_name": "Non-local/distant healing or prayer", "criteria": "Inclusion criteria - HIV infection - History of a CD4 cell count less than 200 cells/mm3 - Stable antiretroviral regimen - English-speaking Exclusion criteria - Inability or unwillingness to fill out questionnaires - History of non-HIV related life-threatening disease", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "65 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00079534.xml"}
