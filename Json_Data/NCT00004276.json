{"brief_title": "Phase II Placebo Controlled Study of Thalidomide in Patients With Mycobacterial and HIV Infections", "brief_summary": "OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate whether thalidomide modulates toxic host inflammatory responses in patients receiving antitubercular therapy. II. Evaluate whether thalidomide modifies tumor necrosis factor-mediated toxic symptoms of HIV and mycobacterial infections, and limits progression of HIV immunodeficiency. III. Evaluate whether thalidomide stimulates immunity in patients with HIV and/or mycobacterial infections.", "detailed_description": "PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind study. Patients are stratified by type of infection. Patients are randomly assigned to oral thalidomide or placebo. Therapy is administered daily for up to 8 weeks, beginning the night before antitubercular treatment is initiated.", "condition": ["HIV Infections", "Mycobacterium Infections", "Tuberculosis"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["thalidomide"], "criteria": "PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA: --Disease Characteristics-- Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or mycobacterial infection that requires at least 10 days of inpatient antitubercular treatment Mycobacterial infection confirmed by positive acid-fast bacilli smear or culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis At least 1 of the following signs and symptoms required: - Temperature over 38 degrees C on at least 2 occasions within 1 week prior to treatment - Weight loss greater than 5 kg - Pulmonary involvement in at least 1 lobe on x-ray Night sweats on at least 2 occasions within 1 week prior to treatment --Prior/Concurrent Therapy-- Concurrent rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for tuberculosis allowed --Patient Characteristics-- - No neuropathy and not at risk for neuropathy - Not pregnant - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception during and for 4 weeks after study", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "65 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "Accepts Healthy Volunteers", "keyword": "viral infection", "mesh_term": ["Infection", "Communicable Diseases", "HIV Infections", "Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome", "Tuberculosis", "Mycobacterium Infections", "Thalidomide"], "id": "NCT00004276"}
