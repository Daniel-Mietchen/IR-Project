{"brief_title": "Effectiveness and Safety of INGN 201 in Combination With Chemotherapy Versus Chemotherapy Alone", "brief_summary": "There is a need for more treatment options for patients with recurrent squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (SCCHN). These tumors usually have a variety of genetic defects that include disruption of the p53 pathway, a pathway that would ordinarily work to prevent the development of tumors. In this study the transfer of the p53 gene to tumor cells using a modified adenovirus (INGN 201) in combination with chemotherapy (cisplatin and fluorouracil) will be compared to chemotherapy with cisplatin and fluorouracil in patients who have failed surgery and radiotherapy.", "condition": "Carcinoma, Squamous Cell", "intervention_type": "Genetic", "intervention_name": "INGN 201", "criteria": "- 18 years or older - Must have had radiation treatment - Eligible for chemotherapy - Not eligible for surgery", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00041626.xml"}
