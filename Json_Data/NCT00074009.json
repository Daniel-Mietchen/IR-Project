{"brief_title": "Bortezomib in Treating Patients With Unresectable or Metastatic Gastric Cancer or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bortezomib in treating patients who have unresectable or metastatic gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the efficacy of bortezomib in patients with unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. Secondary - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. - Determine possible predictors of response to this drug, using pretreatment tumor immunohistochemistry, in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter study. Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-33 patients will be accrued for this study within 5-12 months.", "condition": "Gastric Cancer", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "bortezomib", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically or cytologically confirmed unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma - Siewert's class II or III disease - Measurable disease - At least 1 unidimensionally measurable lesion at least 20 mm by conventional techniques OR at least 10 mm by spiral CT scan - No history of known or active brain metastases or primary brain tumors PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - 18 and over Performance status - Karnofsky 60-100% OR - ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy - Not specified Hematopoietic - WBC at least 3,000/mm^3 - Absolute neutrophil count at least 1,000/mm^3 - Platelet count at least 100,000/mm^3 Hepatic - Bilirubin no greater than 1.5 mg/dL - AST and ALT no greater than 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (5 times ULN if liver metastases are present) Renal - Creatinine no greater than 1.5 mg/dL Cardiovascular - No prior cerebrovascular event - No prior orthostatic hypotension - No myocardial infarction within the past 6 months - No peripheral vascular disease requiring surgical management - No evidence of acute ischemia or significant conduction abnormality by EKG Other - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective contraception during and for at least 2 months after study participation - No evidence of peripheral neuropathy - No prior allergic reaction attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biological composition to bortezomib - No other malignancy within the past 3 years except basal cell skin cancer, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or adequately treated nonmetastatic prostate cancer - No ongoing or active infection - No psychiatric illness or social situation that would preclude study participation - No other concurrent uncontrolled illness that would preclude study participation - No other medical condition or reason that would preclude study participation PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - More than 3 weeks since prior immunotherapy - No concurrent biological or immunological agents Chemotherapy - No more than 1 prior chemotherapy regimen (including adjuvant chemotherapy) - More than 3 weeks since prior chemotherapy (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin) - No concurrent chemotherapy Endocrine therapy - Not specified Radiotherapy - More than 3 weeks since prior radiotherapy - No concurrent radiotherapy Surgery - Not specified Other - Recovered from all prior therapy - No other concurrent investigational agents - No other concurrent anticancer agent or therapy", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00074009.xml"}
