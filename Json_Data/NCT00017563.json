{"brief_title": "Combination Chemotherapy Followed by Surgery in Treating Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug and giving chemotherapy before surgery may shrink the tumor so that it can be removed during surgery. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy followed by surgery in treating patients who have localized prostate cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Determine the 5-year freedom from prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence in patients treated with this regimen. - Define the maximum tolerated dose of neoadjuvant docetaxel and mitoxantrone followed by prostatectomy in patients with high-risk localized prostate cancer. (Phase I completed as of 2/15/02) - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the PSA response rate and pathologic response rate in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the clinical response in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the surgical margin status at time of prostatectomy in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of mitoxantrone. (Phase I completed as of 2/15/02) Patients receive neoadjuvant docetaxel and mitoxantrone weekly on weeks 1-3. Treatment repeats once a week for a total of 4 courses. Patients receive escalating doses of mitoxantrone until the maximum tolerated dose is determined. (Phase I completed as of 2/15/02) Patients undergo prostatectomy 2-4 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": ["Prostate Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Drug", "Drug", "Procedure"], "intervention_name": ["docetaxel", "mitoxantrone hydrochloride", "conventional surgery"], "description": ["35 mg/m2 i.v. over 15 - 30 minutes will be administered immediately after the mitoxantrone on the same schedule.", "Initial dose will be 2 mg/m2 weekly for 3 of every 4 weeks.
