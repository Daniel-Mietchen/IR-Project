{"brief_title": "Safety and Efficacy Study of Interferon Gamma-1b in Hepatitis C Patients With Liver Fibrosis or Cirrhosis", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this research study is to test the safety and effectiveness of Interferon gamma-1b (IFN-g 1b) injected subcutaneously (under the skin) for the treatment of advanced liver fibrosis and cirrhosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C infections. IFN-g 1b is not currently approved for the treatment of liver fibrosis.", "detailed_description": "This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of IFN-g 1b in patients with advanced liver fibrosis and cirrhosis due to hepatitis C. This study will also evaluate whether IFN-g 1b is effective in reducing the amount of fibrosis in the liver.", "condition": "Cirrhosis", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "interferon gamma-1b", "description": "100 or 200 mcg, SQ, 3x per week", "criteria": "- Men or women 18 to 75 years - Chronic hepatitis C infection based on a history of positive anti-HCV antibody and/or HCV RNA - History of prior treatment with interferon-a-based therapies or an assessment by the investigator that the patient would not benefit from interferon-a-based therapy or that treatment with interferon-a is contraindicated - Stage 4, 5 or 6 liver fibrosis according to the Ishak scoring system. - Cannot have presence of clinically evident ascites requiring active diuretic therapy, history of or therapy for hepatic encephalopathy, or history of GI variceal bleeding within the last 2 years (diuretic therapy of stable mild-to-moderate peripheral edema is permitted) - Must meet minimum blood chemistry requirements - Cannot have unstable or uncontrolled thyroid disease - Cannot have a variety of other diseases (listed in protocol - Other conditions for enrollment exist which would be discussed with a Clinician upon screening for the study.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "75 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00043303.xml"}
