{"brief_title": "Perfusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Measuring the Growth of Blood Vessels in Newly Diagnosed Brain Tumors", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Perfusion magnetic resonance imaging may be an effective method of measuring the growth of blood vessels in brain tumors. These measurements may help doctors better diagnose and treat brain tumors. PURPOSE: Pilot study to determine the effectiveness of perfusion magnetic resonance imaging in measuring the growth of blood vessels in newly diagnosed brain tumors.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: I. Correlate the findings of perfusion magnetic resonance imaging with known tissue and serum markers of angiogenesis in patients with newly diagnosed surgically resectable brain tumors. OUTLINE: Patients undergo perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning with contrast in conjunction with preoperative conventional MRI scanning with contrast. Patients receive gadopentetate dimeglumine IV over 5 seconds prior to perfusion MRI. Gadopentetate dimeglumine is administered at a slower rate prior to conventional MRI. Patients undergo blood draw to determine urokinase type plasminogen activator levels. After completion of perfusion and conventional MRI scanning, brain tumor tissue samples are obtained during surgical resection to determine tumor grade and type and urokinase type plasminogen activator and basic fibroblast growth factor levels. If CSF removal is required during surgery, then CSF samples are collected to determine urokinase type plasminogen activator and basic fibroblast growth factor levels. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study.", "condition": "Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors", "intervention_type": "Radiation", "intervention_name": "gadopentetate dimeglumine", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Newly diagnosed surgically resectable brain tumor PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: Over 18 Performance status: Not specified Life expectancy: Not specified Hematopoietic: Not specified Hepatic: Not specified Renal: Not specified Other: Able to tolerate gadopentetate dimeglumine contrast Medically stable PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: Not specified Chemotherapy: No prior chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: Not specified Radiotherapy: No prior radiotherapy Surgery: See Disease Characteristics", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00005790.xml"}
