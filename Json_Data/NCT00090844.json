{"brief_title": "Triptorelin for Preserving Ovarian Function in Premenopausal Women Receiving Chemotherapy for Early-Stage Breast Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Chemoprotective drugs, such as triptorelin, may protect normal ovarian cells from the side effects of chemotherapy. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well triptorelin works in preserving ovarian function in premenopausal women who are receiving chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the protective effect of chemical ovarian suppression using triptorelin on the preservation of ovarian function in premenopausal women with early-stage operable breast cancer undergoing adjuvant or neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy. Secondary - Determine the rate of chemotherapy-related amenorrhea in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the value of inhibin A and B as alternative markers of premature ovarian failure in patients treated with this drug. - Determine quality of life of patients treated with this drug. - Determine disease-free and overall survival of patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age (< 35 years vs 35 to 39 years vs > 39 years); concurrent neoadjuvant or adjuvant systemic chemotherapy (fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide [6 courses] OR fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide [6 courses] vs doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide [AC] [4 courses] vs doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide [AC] [4 courses] followed by a taxane [4 courses]); and hormone receptor status (estrogen receptor [ER]- AND progesterone receptor [PR]-negative vs ER- OR PR-positive). - Arm I: Beginning within 1-4 weeks before the start of chemotherapy, patients receive triptorelin intramuscularly once monthly for 4-6 months during neoadjuvant or adjuvant systemic chemotherapy. - Arm II: Patients receive neoadjuvant or adjuvant systemic chemotherapy only. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, monthly during treatment, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually for 3 years. Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and then annually for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 138 patients (69 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 35 months.", "condition": ["Breast Cancer", "Hormone Changes", "Drug Toxicity"], "intervention_type": ["Drug"], "intervention_name": ["triptorelin"], "description": ["3.75 mg TRELSTAR DEPOT (triptorelin) administered monthly as single intramuscular injection"], "arm_group_label": ["triptorelin"], "other_name": ["Trelstar Depot"], "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria: DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed breast cancer - Early-stage, operable disease - Scheduled to receive adjuvant or neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy for breast cancer - Hormone receptor status: - Meets 1 of the following criteria: - Estrogen receptor (ER)- OR progesterone receptor (PR)-positive - ER- AND PR-negative - No history of premature ovarian failure PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - Under 45 Sex - Female Menopausal status - Premenopausal - Follicle-stimulating hormone levels < 40 IU/L at baseline AND at least 2 menstrual periods within the past 6 months - No first-degree relative menopausal at < 40 years of age Performance status - Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] 0-1 Life expectancy - Not specified Hematopoietic - Not specified Hepatic - Not specified Renal - Not specified Other - Not pregnant or nursing - Fertile patients must use effective non-hormonal methods of contraception - No prior osteoporosis or other non-malignant systemic disease that would preclude prolonged follow-up - No known allergies to gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists - No other cancer except nonmelanoma skin cancer PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - Not specified Chemotherapy - See Disease Characteristics - No prior chemotherapy Endocrine therapy - At least 2 weeks since prior oral contraceptives - No prior fertility treatment - Clomiphene or pergonal for polycystic ovarian disease allowed - No other concurrent oral or transdermal hormonal therapy, including any of the following: - Estrogen - Progesterone - Androgens - Aromatase inhibitors - Hormone replacement therapy - Oral contraceptives Radiotherapy - No prior ovarian radiotherapy Surgery - No prior bilateral oophorectomy - No plans for oophorectomy or hysterectomy within the next 2 years Other - At least 1 week since prior warfarin Exclusion Criteria: - History of premature ovarian failure - Over 45 years of age - First-degree relative menopausal at < 40 years of age - Pregnant or nursing - Prior osteoporosis or other non-malignant systemic disease that would preclude prolonged follow-up - Known allergies to gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists - Other cancer besides nonmelanoma skin cancer - Prior chemotherapy - Prior ovarian radiotherapy - Prior bilateral oophorectomy", "gender": "Female", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "44 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "stage II breast cancer", "mesh_term": ["Breast Neoplasms", "Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions", "Triptorelin Pamoate"], "id": "NCT00090844"}
