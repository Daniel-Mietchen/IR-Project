{"brief_title": "Evaluating Patients With Abnormal Levels of Gastric Acid", "brief_summary": "This study is used by the Digestive Diseases Branch to evaluate patients with suspected abnormalities in the secretion of gastric acid. The level of gastric acid is measured by analyzing the gastric juices of each individual patient. The gastric acid sample is obtained by a procedure known as nasogastric suctioning, where a thin plastic tube is passed from the nose to the stomach. Depending on the patient's present condition further diagnostic testing may be required to achieve a diagnosis.", "detailed_description": "This study is an omnibus protocol used by the Digestive Diseases Branch to evaluate patients with suspected abnormalities of gastric acid secretion. Gastric acid secretion is measured by means of analysis of gastric juices obtained by nasogastric suction. Other clinically indicated diagnostic procedures are performed depending on the patient's clinical state in order to reach a diagnosis.", "condition": "Zollinger Ellison Syndrome", "criteria": "Eligibility criteria not identified in the protocol.", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00001240.xml"}
