Exclusion Criteria: - Patients must not have metastatic disease that can be completely surgically resected, - Patients who received adjuvant taxane must not have experienced disease progression within 12 months of beginning that therapy, - Patients must not have received chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or Herceptin within 2 weeks of E7070 treatment start and must have recovered from any chemotherapy-related or other therapy-related toxicity at study entry, - Patients must not have received investigational drugs including immunotherapy, gene therapy, or other biologic therapy; antineoplastic therapy; or radiation therapy (other than required for palliation of bone pain or chest ulceration) within 2 weeks of E7070 treatment, - Patients must not have received prior treatment with Mitomycin C or nitrosoureas, - Patients must not have undergone high dose chemotherapy with hematopoietic stem cell rescue, - Patients must not have untreated brain metastases (Patients who have been treated for central nervous system (CNS) metastases must be asymptomatic and radiologically stable [not receiving radiation] and must not have been receiving steroids for 4 weeks prior to entry.
