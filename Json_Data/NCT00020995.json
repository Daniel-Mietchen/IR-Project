{"brief_title": "Low-Fat, High-Fiber Diet Compared to a Standard Diet in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: A low-fat, high-fiber diet may slow the growth of prostate cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of a low-fat, high-fiber diet with that of a standard diet in treating patients who have prostate cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: - Compare the inhibition of growth of human prostate cancer cell lines by serum from patients with prostate cancer before and after being fed a low fat, high fiber diet. - Determine the underlying mechanism through which a low fat, high fiber diet affects the growth of prostate cancer cell lines. - Determine whether a low fat, high fiber diet inhibits the growth of prostate cancer cell lines through androgen-dependent and/or androgen- independent mechanisms in these patients. - Determine the growth factors, hormones, and/or binding proteins that may be responsible for affecting the growth of prostate cancer cell lines in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. - Arm I: Patients receive a low fat, high fiber diet daily for 3 weeks. - Arm II: Patients receive a control diet containing the standard amounts of fat and fiber. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients (20 per arm) will be accrued for this study within 6 months.", "condition": ["Prostate Cancer"], "intervention_type": ["Procedure"], "intervention_name": ["therapeutic dietary intervention"], "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate - Previously untreated and on watchful waiting - Medically able to receive dietary intervention PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: - 40 to 80 Performance status: - Not specified Life expectancy: - Not specified Hematopoietic: - Not specified Hepatic: - Not specified Renal: - Not specified Other: - Must be willing to travel to UCLA 3 days a week for 4 weeks to obtain specially prepared foods PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: - Not specified Chemotherapy: - Not specified Endocrine therapy: - No concurrent luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists (leuprolide or goserelin) - No concurrent androgen-receptor blocking agents (flutamide or bicalutamide) - No concurrent testosterone - No concurrent insulin - No concurrent finasteride Radiotherapy: - Not specified Surgery: - No prior orchiectomy Other: - No concurrent saw palmetto supplement", "gender": "Male", "minimum_age": "40 Years", "maximum_age": "80 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "keyword": "stage IV prostate cancer", "mesh_term": ["Prostatic Neoplasms"], "id": "NCT00020995"}
