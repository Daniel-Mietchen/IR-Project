{"brief_title": "Epirubicin and Docetaxel in Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer", "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as epirubicin and docetaxel, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of epirubicin when given with docetaxel in treating patients with metastatic prostate cancer.", "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of epirubicin when administered with docetaxel in patients with metastatic, androgen-independent adenocarcinoma of the prostate. - Determine the response rate (objective and prostate-specific antigen response) and duration of response in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of epirubicin. Patients receive epirubicin IV over 30 minutes and docetaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of epirubicin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for up to 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-36 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.", "condition": "Prostate Cancer", "intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "epirubicin hydrochloride", "criteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate - Meets 1 of the following criteria: - Measurable disease with any prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value - Unidimensionally measurable lesion \u2265 20 mm by conventional techniques OR \u2265 10 mm by spiral CT scan - Histologic confirmation required if measurable disease is confined to a solitary lesion - Non-measurable disease with PSA \u2265 5 ng/mL* - The following are considered non-measurable disease: - Bone lesions - Pleural or pericardial effusion - Ascites - CNS lesions - Leptomeningeal disease - Irradiated lesions unless disease progression was documented after prior radiotherapy NOTE: *Patients with PSA \u2265 5 ng/mL only are not eligible - Progressive systemic disease despite \u2265 1 prior standard endocrine therapy with orchiectomy, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist, or diethylstilbestrol, as indicated by 1 of the following criteria: - Objective evidence of increase > 20% in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions from the time of maximal regression OR the appearance of 1 or more new lesions - One or more new lesions on bone scan secondary to prostate cancer AND PSA \u2265 5 ng/mL - Elevated PSA (\u2265 5 ng/mL) with 2 consecutive increases from baseline (taken \u2265 1 week apart) - Serum testosterone \u2264 50 ng/dL for patients without bilateral orchiectomy - Patients who have not had a bilateral orchiectomy should continue therapy with primary testicular androgen suppression (e.g., LHRH analogues) PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age - 18 and over Performance status - ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy - Not specified Hematopoietic - Granulocyte count \u2265 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count \u2265 100,000/mm^3 Hepatic - Meets 1 of the following criteria: - AST or ALT normal AND alkaline phosphatase \u2264 5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) - AST or ALT \u2264 1.5 times ULN AND alkaline phosphatase \u2264 2.5 times ULN - AST or ALT \u2264 5 times ULN AND alkaline phosphatase normal - Bilirubin normal Renal - Creatinine \u2264 1.5 times ULN Cardiovascular - No uncontrolled high blood pressure - No unstable angina - No symptomatic congestive heart failure - No myocardial infarction within the past 6 months - No serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia - No New York Heart Association class III or IV heart disease Other - Fertile patients must use effective contraception during and for at least 3 months after study participation - No peripheral neuropathy \u2265 grade 2 - No prior severe hypersensitivity reaction to docetaxel or other drug formulated with polysorbate 80 PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy - No concurrent filgrastim (G-CSF) or sargramostim (GM-CSF) Chemotherapy - No prior chemotherapy, including estramustine or suramin for prostate cancer - No other concurrent chemotherapy Endocrine therapy - See Disease Characteristics - At least 4 weeks since prior antiandrogen therapy - No concurrent hormonal therapy except steroids for adrenal insufficiency, hormones for non-disease-related conditions (e.g., insulin for diabetes), or intermittent dexamethasone as an antiemetic Radiotherapy - See Disease Characteristics - At least 4 weeks since prior radiotherapy - At least 8 weeks since prior strontium chloride Sr 89 or samarium Sm 153 lexidronam pentasodium - No concurrent palliative radiotherapy Surgery - See Disease Characteristics - At least 4 weeks since prior surgery and recovered", "gender": "Male", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No", "id": "NCT00096304.xml"}
